Voice: Hello, what? 

Arlo: Hey, Sid. Here, get back in your chair. Hey, Sid. Look, I know you're not the cleanest guy in the world, but were you urinating in the sink again?

Sid: What? Fuck you!

Arlo: What have I told you about that?

Sid: Yes.

Arlo: Then how do you explain the urine in the sink?

Sid: I rented Deathlist. I feel dirty because I've been watching Deathlist.

Arlo: What the hell is Deathlist?

Sid: Fuck you!

Arlo: No, that's not what, my last roommate, he, he wasn't really the greatest actor in the world, but at least he was clean.

Sid: Get out! Fuck you, get out! Get out!

Arlo: Look, I gotta go to work.

Sid: Get out. Get out!

Arlo: Alright, I'm going to work. I'll be back in a few hours.

Sid: Rodney, don't call here for a while. I've got to do me dishes. Dishes, dishes...filth...how does one do dishes? He wants to clean the dishes. I'll clean them right good. Perhaps a little dubles. Right good! A magic soap. Oh, the magic does. How does one, oh! Heavens have mercy, the most awful stench. Oh!

Arlo: And this is the basement. Now, I'm gonna go back upstairs and work for a bit. Uh, why don't you just kinda, you know, get to know the basement, familiarize yourself. And I'll come back down and check on you in a few minutes. Don't get in any trouble.

Sid: Oh, heavens. Good, good grief. Heavens have mercy, what is that smell? Heavens! To get 'em, I'm going to get all the chickens. Remember that. Remember that. Remember I got to get out of chains.
