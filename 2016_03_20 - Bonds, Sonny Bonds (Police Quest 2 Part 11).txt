mean worsen Tiberius Kirk says it was

mean I can only assume that's a
different city we know we know there's
an airport okay apparently the twitch
email about the stream just went out now
the twitch is moving their servers
there's gonna be some hiccups sorry
everyone who's late

and I sui's I sent out the tweet but you
might not have check the tweet is fine

she comes
watch out boys she'll chew you up Jessie
Baines escaped jail yesterday and has
gone on a rampage killing anyone who put
him behind buzz Donald Kobe lives in
Steelton now and could be the next
victim
you should Ted Kobe's phone to see if
Baines goes back phone taps a good idea
information I'll see you later
certainly don't need any more
information than that that's all I need
you don't have to tell me who Baines is
or anything like that I can watch the
stream but I haven't got a tweet or
email yeah I tweeted I tweeted the the
great start time tweet tweet tweet
Rock and Robin can you give someone the
papyrus voice I miss him oh sure of
course if I can remember the pup hire
his for his I'm curious since we put the
the last of that on on YouTube yeah yeah
you got a lot of tweets bitching about
the last two hours of the game I've seen
the YouTube comments bitching about the
last two hours of the game and like I'm
done with it I don't care
I just do not like it's fine I didn't
care it like the gates a fine game it's
a fie sweet little story yeah I just
don't have it in my heart to care about
the last two hours of the game I'm sure
there's more to the story we beat it I
don't care so we I don't know if we've
gotten many tweets but I've been reading
the YouTube comments and Jesus Christ
people want us to finish that game
I'm not saying immediately right would
you consider it someday someday
everybody's very late very late very
late it's 9 o clock
here's what's going on if you were just
showing up yeah twitch was what we
assumed was going on with why these
tweets are showing up late yeah twitch
is like moving what are they moving
servers what is the deal specifically
they're changing over to Amazon or their
well a while ago Amazon bought twitch
yes so twitch is now owned by Amazon and
so now they are moving all of the
streams the chat the everything from the
twitch servers to the Amazon servers
which is a really good thing because we
can only assume that Amazon has better
servers so hopefully once the switch is
made it's gonna be nice nice easy
experience but it's everything's a
little cattywampus today yep give you
some ideas Jack I'm at a dead end so we
need to figure out where baines's every
expense to be expensive expensed where
mariae
he just to go to the Jewish drive to the
airport and fly to steal Tintin is that
a thing we can do he's probably not
going there right
that's what they're there people are
saying go to Steelton that's the only
thing I can think of how would Bane's go
to Steelton drive fly whatever he's a
criminal on the go we did call Kobe yep
we did call Colby and now Colby's phone
is off the hook we have a new alias for
him right though that was a bill Cole go
to the airport ask about Cole sure it's
very anal about how close you are to the
door Baines went on the plane yesterday
we we can't get ahold of Colby the
number is busy what do you mean Baines
went on a plane yesterday is this it
true when we went to the airport last
time did Baines take a flight is this a
true I'm trying to wrap my head around
what happened like last week I don't
remember the details
we took a plea what he went to the
airport right today do you go on a plane
he couldn't hang cuz Murray's been
kidnapped since then whenever we had the
date with her he could have flown back
okay
we know we know as of as of after we got
off work yesterday
in game that he was still in the area
because he had to kidnap Marie after the
date with Marie unless unless he's very
good Murray Wilkins impersonator that
whole date was just him to throw us off
he spends well then that would still
mean he's in town he spent all of his
time in jail figuring out how to act
perfectly like like a whore unless he
just hired another horde poses rubies
they all look the same and bought yeah
bombs whenever they're all the same -
Sonny pawns as long as as long as he can
see a tits I'm just looking at your cans

which is such a client I was doing best
of the worst
what's a Clyde it's an one of the ghosts
monsters why if it means something else
I not it's some kind of old Street lingo
oh yeah yeah square or is like a square
at your slide that guy's it's a Clyde
man looks like where is it the man is
either a square or the man well the man
would be a square that's true but not
all separate not all squares are the man
it could be both much like rectangles
stuff to put put the record straight cuz
we had some kind of color issue with the
cameras we basically somebody sent us
pacman ghosts monster rain ponchos right
yeah and Jay handed me one I said ow
Clyde oh yeah and Clyde is the orange
one uh-huh in pac-man but on camera it
looked red in one of the cameras and
with orange in the other people we're
wondering if I had the ghost monster
wrong and the pancha was really red oh
the pancha was definitely orange
actually why not Arabic are you gonna
wear the punch well it's time to stand
up anyway so rich how crazy that rich
stood up the exact second that our stand
up timer went off that's actually a
little crazy rich that's actually a
little crazy that is orange and you know
I don't know but I don't know if the
color information will pick up on the
webcam but you would definitely say that
is definitely orange the cameras were
probably not white balanced beforehand
because Jane might usually don't white
balance like pre shoot and then you know
everything looked fine so they if I
didn't worry about white balancing post
shoot hey Jackie

procedures I think you just gotta shoot
a man there's no hostage negotiation
that's right you gotta fucking shoot him
there's no there's nothing here you
cannot talk to anyone for me yeah all
right fine
Oh what he just shot her
you see that he just shot her well Oh
nope he didn't shoot her
did he throw her down hold on yeah I
think they were done did you just say
that to Keith no I think oh he shot you
all right all right you shot you this is
this is going sour okay
he unshot her right she looked like it
looked like there was blood on the
ground when she fell down and then he
picked her up and you notice you notice
that Keith did not lift a finger he's
he's still looking out the window
wondering where the earth disappeared to
he doesn't even know that a hijack is
happening oh my god I got I got two all
of these newspapers I got a call I got a
call my mother tell her that it's a flat
earth and it disappears when you get
into the metal tube don't go in the
metal tube because the earth disappears
I'm so scared I'm so scared and yes
that's true because Keith ordered the
Bourbon the wine and the beer he's also
drunk blue beads la la chic dudes they
say to go to bum to get a good day to go
to bum bum Island Egypt
okay here we go and we proud no wait
what what what do you want don't get up
he's gonna shoot you again now shoot gun
what because you're good we have to do
that every fucking game day we sighted a
gun at the beginning of this fucking
game a gun does not have you fired your
gun besides at the range we fired at
Abbes it wouldn't lose its sight
oh shit we did well I mean that was that
was yesterday apparently does it um do
everyday day
no we calibrated the fucking gun at the
beginning of the game now I haven't
saved over any well many saves I've been
mad I've got like 19 different ones I
wouldn't worry about that oh fuck it all
goodnight yep what time is it
it's 9:30 we've time that we start at
6:30 no three hours yeah yeah okay I
think there's no way that your gun would
lose its sighting in a day with minimal
usage like that and you know like after
you know like every every couple of
months you check it out if you using it
all the time or if it's going in and out
of your out of your thing I'll be a
holster when's Mayibuye L says finishing
daredevil season 2 has really made me
appreciate the quality voice acting you
gentleman provide blond loving chubby
friend and black cop couldn't act their
way out of a wet nutsack oh you're crazy
I like them all I'm liking daredevil
season 2 so far I don't know if you've
seen any of it now yet I'm only I'm only
a couple episodes in I couldn't like how
bad is the costumer he gets a new
costume

costume relative to the the black
makeshift one ah you know what it's been
a lot of darkness in the new costume so
far oh I'm not talking about that it's
not you know you get used to it it's not
here's I mean it's no black costume like
it's that black mask was awesome yep so
it's it's not that nothing's ever gonna
be that and it's not but I'm only like
three episodes in and I'm enjoying it so
far really like what they're doing with

you've been writing him down you just
take a picture and tweet it at me or I
don't I don't know how what we're gonna
do here to thank subscribers rich is
gonna recite the gun because apparently
we have to do that shit rich was facing
the man he was looking at the terrorists
and I said you gotta you gotta you gotta
the game said because your gun was not
cited specifically it was specific yep
yep this is a huge list I know beefcake
that's why your program is so important
to us yes because it's frequently a huge
list it's frequently a huge list and we
that's why we enjoy your program just so
so much wait do you need to cite first
before you fire no we need to find out

giants the law yesterday oh I went to
the Veii Might Be Giants show it's
probably their last tour who's all right
it wasn't you know they're the late
Might Be Giants are one of my favorite
bands ever and it was great to see them
live again they put on a shockingly
short show yeah
they had no opening act just They Might
Be Giants starting at 9:00 they were
done by 10:30 then they came out for two
encores but each encore was only two
songs and so they were done by 11:00
which like as like an adult who is shit
to do the next day is like oh actually I
kind of like that they did not have a
confetti cannon and they did not I mean
it was a good show they didn't play a
lot of songs I liked mm-hm

favorite Apple it's not flood was just
just shocking to me right I did not take

in any case it was a fine show they just
seemed tired that's why that's why you
stopped touring and that's why they
stopped touring exactly I did not bring
my shoe for them to sign because I
looked into it and it didn't sound like
they were like doing anything after the
show were signing in other places and
when I saw them 14 years ago like they
were they weren't as well-known I guess
there was a smaller venue and they were
signing stuff so I didn't bring my shoe
but everything was fine
everything was fine there's a fine night
we had the kids stay with grandparent
and the the the grandma picked them up
early so Lisa and I got to watch some
daredevil before which honestly I was I
