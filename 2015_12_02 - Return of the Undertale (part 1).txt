per day I don't know it's the day is the
day of happiness it's not the night
therefore is the day I have whatever
close night it's nighttime
I'm just talking to hear my own voice
that's all I'm really doing I've been
there I've been there it's a good place
to be I know I don't even like the sound
of my own voice and these I don't
remember reading these yeah it's fine I
can remember
okay okay right that's that's what you
guys determination I think that's a
thing from the game I'm being filled
with determination I'm being filled with
determination all right people kept
tweeting that to us and I so I think
that's a I think that's something from
the game I think that's an all right
site of such a friendly town unless you
have a determination there it is we are
filled with determination all right
happy rich that's a fancy shirt for
someone who does not like Star Wars I
like Star Wars I just don't love Star
Wars people need to learn there's not
only extremes sake there is only black
and like sake right I like the original
movies haven't cared much for any of the
expanded universe zippered couple games
I have this shirt from when we did they
actually got this for the the prediction
video I think I had it so I just threw
it on no no no apparently because I just
threw this on yeah I'm a hypocrite I'm a
fucking hypocrite Jack because I wore a
star wars t-shirt
I thought internet video where someone
was proclaiming that they fucking loved
Star Wars III don't know who that was
because they were wearing a Darth Vader
helmet you could not see their face
which i think is important a sting shit
oh he's she's got a kid
above your max oh I can't wait I did not
see your Star Wars prediction video
because I know I know you're just
guessing but just in case you're right I
don't want to like watch the movie and
then like have your guesses start
creeping in I want to go in so I'm gonna
what I'm gonna watch it after I see you
stop think I think anything we're
guessing though is just common sense and
you'd have to not watch the trailer oh
my god oh my god I found a warp I don't
know what are we doing Jack what is our
goal
what happened where did we leave off
would you believe me if I told you I
don't remember did we remember we just
got to this town no and I made you read
that conical dialogue in that weird
voice sure I remember that great I have
what do you want jackass lady over there
fella know how to disturb me
oh look at that looks like a sexy rabbit
lady are you referring that's what a
fooi she's right she's kind of curvy
that that explains but you're always
talking about my little pony off camera
nothing Jack doesn't talk about my
little pony off camera I just think that
Jack talks about how sexy farm animals
are I just think that Twilight Sparkle
is a really important character to
children everywhere because she believes
in the power of magic is it my little
cinnamon just the cutest bun buns are so
adorable I thought you're saying I'm
from my little pony oh I have no idea
what lines from my little pony even are
I didn't know you're talking about her

tormented a local monster by decorating
its tree like horns okay well there you
go so that's a monster horn and they're
awful teens
no no that's not a monster horn so we
started given that monster presence to
make it feel better

presents underneath a decorated tree

working in the newspaper this summer the
report that we just filled with comics
and games what my own brand or a
rhinoceros

younger my teachers gave me words such
as when they run out of assignments I
thought they were a waste of time but
look at me now I'm the number one wizard
create an entire underground
Shh we have to be others ever have to be
quiet
that's my quote Kowski ever say look in
your eyes there's someone that has
trouble doing crosswords I love love
hope of compassion this is what people
say monsters souls are made of oh but
the absolute nature of soul is unknown
after all humans have proven their souls
don't need those things to exist monster
history platform was skipping ahead
writer and the humans no longer let me
let me I'm gonna go to one shut up shut
up monster history for I'm ahead of the
game I'm too far ahead of the game what
oh my god there's so much dialogue news
no I I ain't said on they went through
it again Jesus Jesus oh no comeback
scene yes daredevil is good he's so
great so you should watch it also
jessica jones is very good that that npc
is literally named mike mckowski in the
files oh that's funny
carry Lasher testing the tip jar wanted
to say GMP
starring young rich Evans was one of the
most disturbing and interesting examples
of schizophrenia type whatever I've ever
seen was entertained okay that's before
red letter media wouldn't wear on high
school man my call will be did GMP oh
okay
GMP pictures no they go what did the P
stand for stuff pictures like DC Comics
it was like DC Comics you did that
purposefully I didn't you know what my
kid started a little bit before me okay
so I didn't name it
no I didn't name it well there you go
they go must is a report on monster
funerals Jack monster funerals John why
are we reading monster few this was
technically speaking or cool as heck
when monsters get old and kicked the
bucket they turn into dust at funerals
we take that dust and spread it on that
person's favorite thing then their
essence will live on in that
I'm at the page minimum yet and my other
page minimum had I'm kind of sick of
writing this funny did you did you see
the video of the Jar Jar is that there
is this I don't give a shit it also I
have not cuz it's not gonna be charged I
was not going to be a Sith Lord no he's
not going to be a Sith Lord it's really
good well I cuz I know this hold right
like if people are talking about it yeah
I know this whole Jar Jar is a Sith Lord
thing has been like circulating online
for a while now but someone finally put
it in video form which means that I
could you know just listen get out
instead of read yeah it's really funny
and very and apparently it could be
accurate according to the guy who played
Jar Jar and some like cryptic tweets
from Lucasfilm people mm-hmm is this
George Lucas's original treatment this
is what he's all upset about this is
what he's all set about so drawer drawer
was an essential part of my soap opera
plans Jar Jar needs to work he's a more
ambitious carry right I like all that
right but well here you know the the
biggest piece of argument the biggest
argument for Jar Jar being the Sith Lord
that I took away from the video was that
the whole prequels were supposed to
theme with the original vision was a
rhyme right no and I care so little
about all of this it's amazing in the
original movies we had Yoda who was our
when we first met Yoda
he was seemingly like a weirdo goofball
you would never expect him to be a Jedi
Loren right and so then the mirroring in
Jar Jar being the weirdo goofball you'd
never expect him to be in a Sith Lord
you know what you're giving George Lucas
too much credit bets you really think
that man thought that far abyss yes
yes because what else does he do with
his day what else does that man do with
his job he writes he writes star wars
fan fiction unfortunately he also gets
to produce star wars fan fiction but he
can only do fan fiction now alright
while monsters are mostly made of magic
human beings are mostly made of water
humans with their physical forms are far
stronger than us but they will never
know the joy of expressing themselves
through magic they'll never get a bullet
pattern birthday card what your am write
in this book person comes in and picks
up the book instead read it oh sorry
I'm still writing that one what what
because they're made of magic monsters
bodies that would do to this soon the
monster doesn't want to fight its
defenses will weaken and the grille of
the intentions of our enemies the mother
and Tex will hit us that for the being
with a powerful soul struck with the
desire to kill but then the chapter here
monster history part 4 during the humans
no longer we moved out of our old city
home we braved harsh cold damp swampland
and searing heat until we reached what
we now call our capital new home again
our king is really bad at names yeah
I'll bet you crap
that's good Zella bunch of crap let's
get going to the good stuff again it's a
fucking mailbox gotta fight the monsters
mailbox overflowing with unread junk

Oh No it looks like your bone man she'll
burn allow me to tell you about some
complex feelings I think there's not

puzzle solving skills what would you do
