words write them down they are passwords
to computer databank look bulletin
boards near window and you will see that
you're shooting scores aren't too good
don't worry you'll fix that pretty soon
use computer and turn computer on you
can use it as a primitive d OS based
system commands like dir and CD are
available feel free to dig around in
data banks but be sure to scan following
topics personnel Pratt Lloyd and
personnel Haynes Calvin where you had to
fill out the computer type quit and end
computer section go to the narcotics
office and speak to Lloyd Pratt he is a
drug problem

problem good work you must be thinking
now what about that shooting stuff P
patient we are coming to it first you
have to get some equipment go to the
locker room in order to get your locker
code look at back of LPD card now find

mocha and take handcuffs clothes locker

shooting range give gun to weapons
officer for quick trigger check Oh get
ear protection and miles goes to the
free booth give gun to weapons officer
thank you and says okay okay bones
pick any booth and obey all safety
regulations while in the range it's
gonna be huge
when you're ready you can fire at will
and don't forget to see me for a new
supply of ammo before leaving okay so
that's what you should have done before
going to the thing there give me some
hint that's what one rather they should
have for a quick quicker trek get ear
protection for miles and go to the free
booth there seems to be a good time for
some tips about weapon usage blah blah
blah and then that's all the then we you

go that could have been it
yep then further this max copies tonight
from the office 5:3 berry to 10-4 will
copy are you on route to Litton City
Journal
a suniye this escape has got to be a
real nightmare for you on the other hand
it must be a super nightmare for that
poor correctional officer yeah yeah well
partner yeah I guess this mean that that
the that the unspeakable Asterix symbols
has really hit the fan
I should hope Baines let that correction
officer go on oh you know I'm saying
it'd be a shame just a just a shame if
anything happened to I did this past
five to remarry to 1097 let in City Jail
yeah that's where I'm gonna shoot don't
you glove you want with an easier voice
throat five three very tool ten-four no
1097 City Jail finally I you you go
ahead son I'm gonna study a bit have a
smoke
it's gonna be great so yeah so by the
way let's just comment a little bit yeah
the mostly BS thing of having to do that
one very specific really you should not
have been able to go into the fire I
agree
until you were able to do that things
just I agree yes I'll still take it over
point-and-click sure can just click on
things your stalker rather than at least
having to think a little bit well maybe
I should do this but after that
so I'm going to look around now this is
the underground parking garage of the
new living city jail because apparently
they rebuilt the entire city after the
last game everything nothing was good
enough anymore after I put this town on
the map there was such an influx of new
income after you put the angel of death
or the death angel actually there was a
horrible D it could come after that
because that drug trade that was really
keeping the city alive all the drugs and
all the drugs flow into this town named
after the local businesses they spent a
ton of money I really I put the whole
city into an economic crisis we have
where'd the money to rebuild all this
stuff when the President of the United
States god bless his soul gave us
emergency funds to save the town from
from certain disaster I'm filled with
pride as the memories of the dedication
ceremonies returned the dedication
ceremonies to this jail well we'll put
all of the poor people so they won't be
able to bother us nice normal folks
anymore I also have a sneaking suspicion
again that someone's watching me
perhaps through a people of some kind a
rusty peephole it's much easier when you
don't have to draw everything all the
way out into the edges of the frame it
is a time-saving measure because we need
to be efficient
I appreciate efficiency following my
heroic capture of Jessie Bane's aka The
Death Angel boom I became an instant
celebrity after plunging the town into
an economic disaster but now unless I
recapture Bane's only the bitter bitter
memories of failures will remain
dun-dun-dun look at wall I'm gonna look
at this wall now oh I see gutting
lockers built into the gun creed wall
next to a heavy metal door and I don't
appreciate heavy metal
that I don't like anything more risque
than the Beach Boys even them ahead
sound even though I wouldn't ask I'll
make a noise good animals in quiet
less the dogs barking and criminals
sometimes stand up everybody to
understand I've been an hour it's time
to stand up there appears to be a
built-in video camera surveillance
system and a speaker on the wall above
the door there was a button to the right
of the door wouldn't it be nice if we
were older it's not about being nice
it's about doing a civic duty doing this
for your home
take a little break coming any more
water
wouldn't it be nice if we were older
that we wouldn't have to write so learn
it's for your health your health it's
important I feel since I've started
standing up every hour on the stream I
feel so much better afterwards
boom started the timer again you know
like you sit down for just four hours
straight and then you you get up and and
it just it just hurts what's sad
which rich is really sad because there's
just one slice of cheese left in the
kitchen you went to make a sandwich and
there's only one slice of cheese which
is very sad about that so
I stood up to grab a new beer that's
fine you stood up that's all that
matters
that's all that matters no this this
laptop is not a Mac it's a it's an old
Windows laptop that I had at home and I
brought it here so I wouldn't have to
bring in my laptop all the time
we need a longer intermission to get
more cheese yeah
there hasn't been you know like we've
just been playing the game as what
usually happens when we play police
quest it's more you know it actually
holds our attention so there's been less
conversation to catch everybody up
Ghostbusters the remake is gonna suck
that's okay movies suck are you gonna
eat a cheese sandwich live on stream Oh
Oh sputters I love that Bill Murray
that's a funny man it was it was very it
was very sad on Saturday Lisa and I went
to a party and we were all discussing
the Ghostbusters trailer and everybody
was in agreement like oh my god no just
no good can come from this and we we
started discussing you know like the
problems with the trailer and like how
it really didn't compare to the first
one and then it was just like we need to
go watch the first one I'm like I
quickly looked it up online like where I
could get like a blu-ray copy of
ghostbusters oh they ever they've won at
Best Buy's it's in stock right now we'll
stop on the way and then some work stuff
came up so we weren't able to watch the
Ghostbusters on Saturday and that was
really sad I'm sorry you know I do all I
want to do now is watch ghostbusters you
know the sandwich would be delicious
with more cheese on it or something but
they haven't we have got a clue small
Skelton you did you just missed stand-up
time but there's still time stand-up now
we just got back from stand-up time we
are now sitting again taking a little
break staring at a wall while rich eats
a cheese sandwich so
I know we're not progressing very fast
into the game yeah but is the return of
Sunday bonds is it living up to
expectations
this is everything you would hope for
everything everybody hoped for rich I
know it to be true
I know it to be true I don't know if
people will go see the new Ghostbusters
movie the what was what was the other
movie that just bombed recently the
remake the the gem in the Holograms
movie big stars big names nobody care
about jamming the Holograms in the first
place this is not a remake really it's
it well it's a it's a nostalgia property
with with big names in it did not do
very well fairly worthless nostalgia
property just saying Robocop's a better
comparison Robocop the Robocop bomber is
it just for I'm not sure it's definitely
forgotten about well oh yeah it's that
one forgotten hold on I'm gonna I'm
gonna look up the numbers for Robocop
the remake box office mojo dot-com go
Zootopia is doing very well
Robo Cop go Robocop let's see here okay
ready yeah estimated production budget
of Robocop 2014 mmm one hundred million
dollars yeah domestic total gross more
than that 58 million dollars domestic
domestic well because where's that now
oh my god Jesus great well it made a
little bit of money a hundred and eighty
four million what is wrong with you rest
of the world we we'd like to see a
matter connection movie is so cool
though copies all sort of rubber you had
a great previous role that movie made by
a foreign director ooh
could've been for I don't care
Jose Padilla yeah we like we love to
watch American action movie where cop is
also a robot it's our greatest joy oh
the cop is also the robot yeah let me
wash down that mostly bread sandwich
without really ugly can of Diet Coke I
mean really this is just an ugly ugly
can mostly bread sandwich well says Jose
Pedulla not much I think he's a foreign
director how's that Pedulla you don't
expect to have Americans have more
common sense these days Americans did
have more you don't expect it though oh
you don't expect expect it okay yeah I
mean so Americans didn't go see the
Robocop remake yeah that's something
maybe the real dumb fat people are in
Europe from yeah we have cheese and wine
and olive oil goes bust else it has we
mean now it's good we like to see their
women and we also like it when they
ghosts I think it as you say a boost as
it goes but stills they have course with
slime Oh should slime all over the
SummerSlam I'm Italian so I like exist
in my cinema I like Jerry if something
works you just keep doing it again and
again and again and again nor do
ghostbusters
he'll need to be the slime right that's
a little bit funny we got so much fun
now so funny we make a Mad Max movie
whatever card explores every single time
it's so good so many so many versions
okay oh wait jail etiquette I'm assuming
I got to put my gun in the thing yes
my place west to Manuel
nope okay hey push button did it boom Oh
skeletal snuggles would like to give us
a tip for the rich get some cheese fun
will do we're gonna stock this fridge
with all sorts of cheeses give it great
signal the jailor by pushing the buzzer
the jailer speaks to me to the PA system
fucking desk a bomb I guess I'm saying
this but someone else is saying there's
net I just I hurt my brain because that
didn't make any sense but a booking desk
can I help you cuz I asked if I could
help you
is it a ghost hello call for ladies over
here with proton packs oh my god hello
ask about thing ask about bangs I'm not
sure what you want me to do I'm not sure
either goes I'm just gonna open the door
I'm getting confused I'm gonna take out
my gun I'm getting very confused and I'm
going to take out my gun somebody tell
me what I need to do oh now I can't
crocodile brain guys your streamers
always everything that we could possibly
hope for it keep up the great work thing
that Craig Melvin yeah please face the
camera and show your identification
that's salad information that's the
directive of a I know what to do no
thank you I need to make sure you're not
a ghost I'm very afraid of all of no
ghosts of all goes show pictures oh wow
and this way the movie delirious
something very awkward would happen
right now
can I put my badger away now just
showing my ID I hear a loud metal Clank
is that jailer releases the door locks
obviously excited a bonds I can't
believe what happened I can't get always
unless the surfer gonna get no surfer
guy got kidnapped
okay okay Brad I said the jailer got
kidnapped
I can't get over it we've never had an
officer kidnapped before Bane's took pat
patty
pétain paint paint an escaped in Pat
Hayes car I sure hope he's okay poor kid
he's just a rookie in the height
I haven't haven't had it heck we just
put together a file on Baynes this
morning and he's gone already
what was I supposed to do ask about file
that's not a clear sentence but in video
game logic it should work ask file why
do you ask a file which for how do you
want to look at I mean I know we were
just talking about Baynes and how we
just finished the file on Baynes but if
you could be more specific it what file
you want to look at maybe the Baynes
are you a more at audible I'm borderline
underachieving in all my academic
classes I've been a cop for 21 years and
I've never seen anyone quite as stupid
as you if it helps I was raised in a
paint factory bank when I became a cop
you had to pass a test then if you
weren't smart enough you didn't pass the
test and they'd beat you with rocks I'm
not a cop I'm a jailor it's my job to
make sure the door is closed I'm feeling
a strong urge to take you out back and
beat you with rocks
I would I would suggest
that I don't like rocks unfortunately
that's illegal for some reason it's
gonna this sucks so much files you want
to look at Bane's unbelievable
fucking un-fuckin'-believable I can't
believe the things that I'm saying
Oh Aki file files have to say yes give
him back before you leave what happened
to his head he's turning into a girl
he's turning into a hippie or a hippie a
girl able to the same thing really
ultimately there's no difference between
a woman and a hippie except cooking
hippies don't know how to cook no the
raw food we're gonna have to we're gonna
have to round up all the hippies and
teach them how to cook okay let's see
attempted murder Sonny bombs of course
we have a new mugshot nice
Boston secular colors inside a duellist
room again but rich in regards to the
abyss since you haven't seen the
director's cut would you like my old DVD

I enjoyed the nerdy chat about
narratives thanks thank you thank you
fun time last we did we do we twit that
right yeah we tweeted similar it is
people might not might not be hip to the
twits I know I'm not for anyone who
doesn't follow us on the Twitter nerdy
Inc a YouTube channel I had a nice
conversation with us about storytelling
and games and the video just came out I
wanna say yesterday or whenever i
retweeted their tweet about the video
and it was really fun it's like a
45-minute hour long discussion just rich
and me and the two guys from nerdy Inc
talking about story and video game is
quite a quite a fun time we're done it
was good turned out well um what's your
opinion on ghostbusters 3 story games
based on established worlds can tell
good stories like DC Universe Online for
the ps1 it's radio Fox
I didn't play ghostbusters 3 oh the game
oh the game yeah the Ghostbusters the
the recent one 3d one great yeah it's
great
we should play that oh we can't stream
it well we can technically but it's very
dialogue heavy and it's dialogue by Bill
Murray dan Aykroyd inhaled Ramos we
don't want to talk over that I don't
want to talk over that okay this is like
no point and streaming it just find it
and play it yeah oh but no you're right
van Belding it is just audio it is
there's no video it is just us talking
so like it's a youtube video but just
put
in the background and it's it's
basically a podcast so we figured out
what we need to do oh hold on
oh whoa gonna get caught up this first
games mm that sounds an awful lot like
Bane's
I've got my eye on you spectacularly
sick this evening nothing better than
hard-boiled Sonny bonds and Edith bunker
to lift my spirits that that the classic
crime-fighting duo right there Sonny
bombs and Edith bunker Oh Sammy I don't
think we're in the right neighborhood
knows what a day's rich really doesn't
want to give Ernie Hudson winston
zeddemore any credit that's the second
time he's left him out because he's
relatively unimportant I'm sorry I know
Winston has his fans I don't hate the
character I don't hate Ernie Hudson
yeah but ghostbusters is a classic
because of Bill Murray Harold Ramis and
Dan Aykroyd also you could replace Ernie
Hudson with a lot of different actors
and it wouldn't change the movie at all
Ernie Hudson's great he's great in the
movie replace him with Eddie Murphy and
you've got a better movie probably well
the character actually is the straight
man so let's see that's the thing about
his character he is the audience avatar
right he's supposed to be uninteresting
and unimportant
he's the information sponge right okay
so they can dump like how all the
equipment works as a site I also think
it's just kind of a joke that you know
with for most of the movie like 2/3 of
the movie we have our established guys
and these are our main characters and
then all of a sudden there's just like
employee with them it is this out of
place guy who's just there for the money
right you got work for me this is great
it's just there I will believe in
whatever you tell me to if there's a
paycheck in it that's that's how he's
not a terrible character he's just not
an essential ingredient to the magic
you could replace that met character
that Ernie Hudson even then even the
character you could was hurting Hudson a
lot of different actors who could just
be a straight man
yeah and it's fine but it's just fine
but Ernie Hudson does a great job yeah I
never said he did a bad job never said
he did a bad job why do you hate her and
Hudson so much extremes everything's
gonna stream everything's a fucking
extreme the Tigers Kirk Winston was
conceived as Eddie Murphy Aykroyd wrote
the character for Murphy after doing
trading places with him Winston was
supposed to be the best Ghostbuster he
had more science training and was a
marine but they needed an every man
without Winston they're not crying about
absolutely.i I've heard that like you
know his character was supposed to be
this huge part of but no you need to be
do you think the movie is terrible
before Winston shows up and to do you
think that Ernie Hudson is the only
person who could have done this job
those are the two things I want to ask -
yep yep welcome to the Internet okay
great but back to the back of the thing
Oh oh yeah you figured out what hey I
asked about Pete no there's another file
on paint because the chiller is an idiot
it didn't think to do this in the first
place here's a line motherfucker oh oh
yeah you want to look at paints fine
I'll go get it for ya oh yeah that makes
a lot of sense
you mean the guy who is kidnapped you
want to know about him too weird you
know bands the fantasy here's a map for
you Louise you spit you can't take well
let's see if there's maybe important
information on her what do we got
let's get her let's get our handy-dandy
notebook I mean sono alias nice date of
birth these things might be might be
useful like we gotta wait out we're
gonna ready a call male 511 black brown
hair found a ditch and oh that's
probably paid yeah yeah but then we
don't need information well we don't
remember just write down what do you
want date of birth birth Wow
yeah sure sure height hair weight 511
165 black hair
okay
corrections officer what is what a stat
probation mean I don't know that weird
depart mental actions none so I don't
think II was on probation when he sent
me V we worked that was this job he
worked in brochure that could be yeah
okay well we're good and there's no way
to get further in nope okay great
definitely don't want to forget my guts
your gun I mean any updates of the
Winston's situation
Oh ghost was removing an Amazon Prime
video with it maybe I'll watch that like
I'd like to get you know what I'd and
actually the Best Buy has like a
Ghostbusters 1 & 2 on blu-ray but it
didn't have any special features behind
besides like that a dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis roundtable discussion which
could be great and I'd like a nice
blu-ray like some commentary behind the
scenes shit you know
open door they're saying don't go
they're saying they're saying we're not
done for Randall John B eight to twenty
says thank you Jack and rich you're
welcome you're welcome thank you thank
