hello and welcome to the space cop
commentary I'm Mike I am rich and I'm
Jade and I'm very excited to be doing
this commentary because it means the
movies done look at that building in the
background and that special that was the
future police headquarter building oh my
God look at all these amazing things in
the future just doing stuff to keep
track oh that's the future everybody who
built that model of the moon I did oh my
god he built the model of the moon
oh I built the fucking move rich built
the moon okay the model is a upturned
nacho dish or whatever like a it's like
a sampler platter like an appetizer yeah
at the center of $1 throw him a dollar
store he's great special effects oh my
god there's too much to talk about
already Oh Colin our friend Colin from
Canada just did those effects where the
car shoots off into the sky he has a
future Milwaukee background the future
Milwaukee back running the Star Wars
Episode two cars flying in the
background when Jim did the the space
cop headquarters right yes yeah that's a
physical model it's a physical model him
and Colin worked on that together
Jim built it last year or a year before
and then they kind of rebuilt it they
upgraded it the Aged it's great now for
the original shots couple summers ago
Jim won he kind of had to make it
quickly and he always wanted to add more
detail to it so they did and then this
is the moonbase opening which wasn't the
original opening we started it's sort of
the way it ended up there was almost two
opening reveals of space cops so we
ended up cutting the first one which I
believe you will see in the deleted
scenes yeah it opened with space car
buying a hot dog from a robot hot dog
vendor and then heading up to the moon
base but we figured we his entrance of
blowing the door up and stepping through
was more of a grand entrance yeah so we
modeled it kind of after the opening of
Robocop 2
when the the punks are running amok and
rowboat you only see Robocop driving
around in his car and you don't see him
until I think they blow his car up with
a rocket and then he steps out of the
debris it's kind of pointless to make a
Robocop like a reveal in Robocop 2 we've
already seen him yeah it's fine awesome
anyway back to space down funny to me as
we film that hot dog scene twice and you
yeah zero time yeah yeah the first time
we tried to film it downtown and it was
we were rushed we didn't get the shots
we needed and it just looked bad so we
redid it near our studio and then it
just got cut anyway but here are two
wonderful actors from Milwaukee riff
kensic and Tim Higgins
you probably recognize Tim from other I
I don't count as a wonderful actor I
mean there's me with a mask on Jack
obviously that's Jack but the
co-director of the film is hidden under
that mask
yep why cuz we needed a body yep we did
try to do a bit here I was always talk
about that what the the reaction to that
explosion we yeah we tried we we got an
air compressor which is how we did this
Haddix this some head shot where Rick's
brains go all over the wall and it's a
high-powered air compressor so the first
attempt at it
shot the blood and guts up on the
ceiling yeah it was too powerful at like
500 million the ceiling was like 30 feet
high in the studio and so we're like oh
my god like I wasn't prepared for that
kind of force so I have a thing but then
we got it right the second time and then
we had the stupid idea of trying to make
my character spray vomit out of his
mouth yes in reaction to the head and
react blasted off right which just
happened there and I was holding the the
little nozzle inside the mask and then
and then the force was so powerful that
it fell inside the mask and exploded you
know I I thought I was going to drown
drown I thought I was going to choke to
death
as I had the mask was so like tight on
my head and I was like get it off get it
off thank you for not putting that in
the outtakes J I did not put that in the
outtakes cuz I wouldn't be funny unless
you were there it was frightening
yeah frightening for you funny for
everybody else yeah here's space cop
having a one-liner because he thinks he
actually accomplished something he did a
cult or something he shot a man all the
innocent people that were killed were
just you know that's what you have to do
so happens yeah it's just another
accomplishment
these things happen Jake yeah it's a
fine establishment of the space cop
character but you did a fine job on that
moon oh thank you thank you and here is
our our cgi opening brought to you by
our friends from Canada Colin had
purchased a model a CGI model of a Ford
that's it's a Ford um around that crown
vic yeah and and then he created the
details they look great
like that like that the the exhaust
which I think I believe is just like an
air duct vent thing that we painted and
on the real car you me on the real car
yeah but he created the CGI versions of
them and made this little lot and then
the scuff marks yeah it's very detailed
it's very accurate to the actual space
cop car and all this all this kind of
con stuff is his concept it's it's the
new bean factory the new bean factory
what are all the jokes joke - this is
the Rainbows remedy the evinced
bereavement center yeah and then low
blows fireworks Emporium and we all
remember low blow from the film low blow
yes the film where the guy has the giant
hand he doesn't have a giant hand on the
cover logo that's right yeah yeah yeah
there's already a lot of references to
best of the worst movies in this and
that just upped it just let opening
credit sequence yeah upped it by three
this is another college
mm-hmm the first time I saw this I loled
for real when the car does this and
knocks it yeah this is all Cohen's
concept that's a good bid and now we cut
to our buildings tiny little styrofoam
buildings with squares cut out with
light blowing behind them I did a
fantastic job
fantastic you know what they look fine
for what they are
here's question why did we want me to
make fake bill we could have filmed
actual buildings but we wanted me to
make fake buildings what was the
reasoning um I think I wanted that that
dolly shot and that's something I
couldn't I could just get a static shot
in real life I like them the movement
well if we were to try to do a dolly
shot of a real building it would be you
know three feet right as opposed to this
pretty sweeping that you see with the
exacta model so you kind of needed to be
in miniature and this is the second
appearance of the sharper image
remote control mm-hmm that has been
spray-painted first appearance was on
the table in the Moon Mayor scene right
that's a device Jack reaches for there's
Star Wars
oh that's sweatshirt right behind rich
there's the hohoho
I have a machine-gun sweatshirt from die
hard and I think the horse ninja comic
from an old half of the bag episode is
on the ground but I don't think you see
it
this film is filled with oh the home
sweet home is from the planket house
that's from the Plunkett house the
picture right next to Rich's head there
is mr. Plunkett hot air balloon hisses
his ballooning days in the 1900s always
save your props you will reuse them over
and over this is our celebrity cameo
really is it really a cameo if you're in
every scene rich know
I'm flattered rich what was it like to
work with Patton Oswalt I have no idea
I've never worked at Patton Oswalt you
have you guys went out to LA to film him
yeah yeah it's a crazy story about how
he got involved with this film we set up
a Twitter message saying hey will you be
in our movie and he said okay we floored
when he said sorry he's like I only have
five minutes yeah but I'll do it it
almost it feels like a thing where he
just filmed it himself well yeah no
helmet out there yeah we had someone do
it or like you know it I guess it's not
Skype quality but the equivalent thereof
but we actually went out to LA and
filmed his scene at the Funny or Die
studios um cuz Jack you used to work for
Funny or Die and they were kind enough
to let us use their green screen room
and all their gear the only thing we
brought was the camera yeah we used a
light and I don't know if we use their
microphone it doesn't really matter but
yeah and Patton knew like exactly where
that was and it wasn't like come to this
shady a hotel room we're go we're
shooting this at the Funny or Die
studios so it's legit and yeah he showed
up and we film we had him for about say
about 45 minutes from beginning to end
yeah and a busy guy so the same coat
they're both wearing the same space cop
coat I added I added rank pips to his
collar little batteries like giant
next-gen rank hips but I don't think you
can see them really you see my point
when he gets up when he's like peeking
his head back in I think you see him
yeah so but we put blue on him to
signify like a higher rank than gray and
that's the only difference
I'm gonna ask how did he react he was
off joke oh yeah it was funny like I
sent him that I send him the script of
course and I don't even know if you read
it ahead of time or if he was just like
winging it but we're all worried about
that because I just wrote this tear it's
not so much it as I explained it to
everyone it's not
much a joke the wazzup is not the joke
in itself the joke in itself is that
dated humour has come back around right
like doing Borat is now popular again in
2050 8 so that was the joke and I think
I tried to explain it to Patton again
and it was just like silence for a
second because yeah I get it but he he
sold it he made it yeah I was the entire
time when I read the bit I thought it
this wasn't gonna work when we shot
Rich's angles that thought it wasn't
gonna work but then once we shot
Patton's angles and put the whole thing
together it's it's it was funny yeah I
think cuz he knew what to do yeah he
knew what it was he knew what it was so
do you remember how this came about the
whole is the screen off thing I think he
just started ad libbing we told him what
the scenario was and I think we told him
that it was supposed to end with rich
just staring at him which is the way he
shot it yeah and then he just started
rolling with it and then Jack started ad
living with him as like a tech guy off
to the left yeah and and then you know
and it went on and on because it's
Patton Oswalt when it's funny and it's
funny yeah you don't cut good jokes
exactly well sometimes you do and you
stretch your celebrity cameos long as if
it was awkward and unfunny we'd be in
and out of this scene quickly but sure
all this all this like because it's so
weird - it's such a weird joke mm-hmm
like the idea that space cop is just
watching this happen
and just staring and not doing anything
yeah it's very bizarre there's a little
element of strangeness to it and also
it's just like I don't know if the
police chief is also grossly incompetent
- yeah that's an important part of the
movie is that this is the way the police
force works in the future yeah everybody
is so dependent upon the technology
mm-hmm the technology runs the people
mm-hmm yeah we're making social
commentary here would you say rich that
this movie is as intelligent as wall-e
in that regard oh yes every bit as much
okay oh and this joke here with the book
that's
inspired by Oh Patton Oswalt's improv
line about reading a hollow book yeah
but originally we're gonna have him
reading a newspaper or watching a TV
show or something and then we added the
hollow book because hover book J he says
hollow buck was the outside right hover
book yeah
so we added that's after the fact yeah
he was supposed to be a there was
supposed to be a holographic old-time
newspaper right like just like a
redundancy like but ended up being a
hover book now these ships look great
yeah these are all bull models did we
hire a team of people to make all these
for us no we did it
there's me and Mike oh my god that's why
it looks like crap no no that mother
ship turned out far better than it had
any right to the mothership is is a work
of art rich what was it made of two
sleds two plastic sleds some holes
drilled in them yeah I ran across him
and like Target or something I was like
hey cuz we're looking for something like
the right size and shape as I can this
sled is great and then um what really
sold it though are those side panels
that you added rich like those sections
those things because those were cut out
of some kind of other plastic so that's
just a bunch of well we bought like four
sleds this panel you talked about like
the panels on top of the windows cutting
them no yeah those and the the little
side sections okay
the large sections on the side that jut
out I think I just made the side
sections out of yeah just whatever
material I can try but this the ones on
top those are just from another sled
match the contour oh right yeah so yeah
yeah it's basically just junk from model
kits like you buy a bunch of battleship
models and then you have all these tiny
parts and it's pretty much how they did
like the Star Wars models and stuff was
taking apart kits and reusing little
tiny pieces although much worse
much much worse and on the cop cars a
little cop car with a little tiny man in
it it matches the full car pretty well
though as far as a miniature goes all
the details on it are the same I think I
just glued some pen caps on the back for
the Rockets
yeah but they work they work yeah yeah
what were the full-size rockets made for
him do we remember there are like air
ducts yeah no not that the back that not
the rockets the odd the guns on the
front guns on the cannon I don't know
what they're supposed to be but we found
them at the science and the surplus yeah
I think it was in the the military kind
of like where they had the helmets and
things like that yeah but the tip of it
is a toy and then the main body thing it
was some kind of like tube for like a
bazooka yeah a shell or something
strange but it was like a really hard
plastic or resin and but then I had some
other things glued to him glued a laser
tag toy on the front of some kind of toy
which is the same toy that I turned the
motor on it to make the noises for the
villain at the end yeah that's a servo
plasticky servo mike yeah that's right
that was at one of the thrift stores and
there was like five or six of them
there's a ton of a bunch of them so yeah
bought them all and right I think
they're glued to the walls of the alien
right it's later on parts of them are
all over this movie I think this is I'm
right there that was done on the on the
dashboard yeah yeah they're halves of
them because they came and we unscrewed
them all yeah and this is the set from
dock of the dead right yes amar are
never seen currently unseen plink it
bits from dock of the dead right we
which I don't know what the status is of
currently but we built a set and we shot
some zombie stuff for dock of the Dead I
think you see like one shot of it in in
the final version yeah they cut out a
lot but that's why there's wood you know
hammered into the window there basically
there's there's a little mini Plunkett
review unseen by almost everybody
out there now we don't have the rights
to show yeah yeah maybe someday someday
it might appear on a different version
of dr. the dead so keep your eye out for
it we're not sure about that yet but
this is the set from that I think we
used it for one episode of half in the
bag maybe right yes was nothing a couple
yeah a couple of yeah yeah and then no
we tore it down and was this before we
started building I guess it would be
right before we started building the
spaceship sets yes okay yeah basically
every walls we used yeah that's right we
had hired somebody we actually hired
somebody instead of doing it herself to
construct all these walls that we could
repurpose over and over oh yeah great
job and he did a great job there's solid
walls and they look great and they're
sturdy and we used them for this and
then we tore this apart and we started
building our spaceship sets which every
room on the mothership that you see is
the same walls just reorganized reshaped
so no really so we had to you're gonna
amaze people with that Pat point being
we had to shoot everything for each room
and then tear that down rearrange the
walls shoot everything like everything
in the in the control room everything in
the the lab just little momentum base
and then oh yeah then we ended up using
him for the moon base at the beginning
of the movie so just yeah constantly
reusing repurposing all these walls
because we had limited space so what was
the deal with this location that was
some guys there there was some company
in this building and I found it on
Craigslist and they were moving
locations and they were offering the
building to rent and and I just emailed
the guy and I'm like hey we want can we
just use this building for a day he's
like sure I don't care maybe two I
thought we shot everything in one day no
no I want to say it was three days okay
well we shot all the sámi stuff on one
day we shot the police chief on one day
but the nice thing about it was that
they were planning to move in a month or
so so all the stuff was still there yet
the dividers for the cubicles and this
guy this is
this guy's office yep it's just some
guys office the only thing we did was
put the Ronald Reagan picture up in the
back yeah yeah we're like just move
anything that you know you don't want to
be seen in the movie and shoot in here
so it kind of works those just a little
office area and this is Dale Jackson
Dale Jackson he's amazing he was the
first person cast for the movie yep he
showed up to one of our early auditions
and we said you're hired and then we
shot with him like two and a half years
later yep we should point out that's
because this movie took us a while to
make not that long in the grand scheme
of things about three years total but
the first year was pre-production and
one of the big setbacks we had was just
as we always have which is finding
actors mm-hmm especially for this movie
cuz there's so many specific types of
roles you need yeah and we we always
have trouble finding people in Milwaukee
it's it's tricky so we had multiple
rounds of auditions we even went to
Chicago twice I think to try and cast
people why don't any of the good actors
come to Milwaukee well they're here we
just it's just you got to find him
yeah and so I think we had five or six
different audition sessions throughout
the course of a year and then finally
our friend Jocelyn set up the a the last
one that we did and it turned out to be
the last one because she brought all of
her good actor friends so most of the
people that are cast in this are from
that last round of auditions mm-hmm I
guess if you're a good actor and you see
an ad for a film called space cop you
don't show up to that audition some
people did though you should have said
we're auditioning for terms of
endearment terms of endearment two more
endearment yeah that's true
and then there's so many shit
productions here in Milwaukee that
finished or just complete hack jobs I'm
sure a lot of local actors have been
burned by like being in crap yeah
there's lots of good theater actors and
that's most of the people we cast were
ranked primarily theater certain they
might be hesitant to do more yeah film
productions like Zack and
whoever played his his wife I forget her
name
Alison Alison and then Rick pens ik one
of the cops they're all like very
theatrical yeah and very good at
ad-libbing I might add oh yeah and we
just passed over in a gym mat painting
Oh beautiful beautiful wonderful map
eighteen he made a tiny room look like a
giant room yes as he does again later in
the movie which you'll see yeah so
helpful with expanding the size of the
sense one and one here the cryo lab and
then on the spaceship later we'll see
you later - on the spaceship actually
one outside of the space yes and yeah we
tried to expand the the look of this
room ourselves to adjust the angles we
got in the way we shot it cuz we only
had two cryo tubes right so every angle
you see we're constantly moving those
things around to make it look like
there's more good more than - well no we
have to go in three we only had to we
had to - oh my there's a couple shots
where it looks like there's three
because we're using half of one we'd
split what in half right those things
are like it's I think - on top of each
other or three three yeah they are the
the things that when you have a basement
and you have a window it's like a
sub-basement and the windows in the
ground and it's like that half circle
thing that that your windows looks out
into I have no idea what it's called and
if you know what I'm talking about
you know I'm talking about yeah and
they're expensive and so there's three
yeah but there's a very stacked up three
stacks like half of a cryo tube so six
total twelve total for two cryo tubes
yes and now that was like the biggest
chunk of our whole budget and that was a
visual effect shot where he saw more in
the foreground right that was just
duplicating them yeah so if it was
locked down shot we would we have film
it scootch them down film it screw them
down again and then composite them all
together yeah that's the first shot you
see after Jim's matte painting is that
it's just there were two of them
standing next to each other and then we
moved him over and then we moved them
over again and then just it split
screens no no this is important too they
we had no way to open them up um our
original attempt was to do a stop motion
where they just it opened which looked
great Oh sarcastic it looked terrible
and it wouldn't add we didn't consider
the tops either so we're like I don't
know well I don't think it was like we
didn't consider it so much as there was
absolutely nothing we could do so we're
like yeah whatever
we'll just knock it outta frame maybe so
our friend Colin once again came to the
rescue
and I think created CG versions of the
the door halves and then does this where
he moves it and then flips the lid open
yeah and then added a glow and a seal
and all that and oh my god made a big
difference made a big difference but
here's another actor where it's it's
just a couple lines but you need someone
very specific right so it's like you
can't just cast one of your friends or
some nobody that can tax think it's very
you need very specific people for all
these tiny roles and that's the thing
with this movie is there's so many so
many little characters that pop up like
their character like that guy he showed
up to one of the auditions he was alive
at the time but the movie took so long
to make it was a shot he was dead it's
actually a return performance from Karen
Carpenter Karen Carpenter burn audience
confusion audience confusion confirmed
the original joke with a skeleton was
going to be when the crowd pod opined
that the ghosts of the skeleton was
gonna come out saying I'm free yeah yeah
and then a laser blast was gonna hit
it's gonna ricochet and killed killed
the ghost kills which was a a joke we
stole from our film oranges revenge
eggplant which no one should ever watch
it's terrible
we're yeah but it worked much better
there it for here it just did not work
and you'll see in the
it seems it just was not funny yeah yeah
it didn't quite some things don't work
and you don't know why in some things
work and you don't know why and some
things don't work and it makes it funny
like the the nitrogen tank there yes
where we pictured it you know big bursts
of you know nitrogen coming out and it's
just this tiny little puff and you guys
are reacting like it's right like you've
eaten I think I was like blowing like
power through a tube or something we're
just we wanted to get this done well I
think we also we're like oh we can
enhance it later if we want to yeah and
then but it just seems funny that it was
like so pathetic and tiny we probably
could have put in a like a canned effect
of like smoke or something but a little
bit fake and you know and we all laughed
every time we saw that little puff of
smoke come out so this film is all about
the laughs whether you're laughing with
it or laughing at it as long as we get
the laugh and there's Mike again as an
alien yeah yeah those masks were
wonderful but also frightening at the
same time yeah very very claustrophobic
wearing those the ones without mouthfuls
I was like yeah putting your head in a
suffocation device can we talk about
those getting made yeah well though
they'll be a little featurette as some
people maybe have seen it on YouTube but
there's a feature at about Dale is his
name who made these for us yes from rich
Evans concept drawings he made the masks
they are original masks not not
store-bought or anything made from a
mold and everything yeah he sculpted um
he molded him he painted them mm-hmm and
he did a great job he was a big fan of
like movie props he made his own replica
movie props and I remember his basement
with all of the killer Klowns stuff yeah
that you don't see in the behind the
scenes is his basement is full of
replicas killer clowns from outer space
and some original masks from the actual
movie and if you think the killer clowns
and themselves are a little bit creepy
imagine an original killer clown mask
that is now rotting yeah in somebody's
dark basement
and you can actually see Dale in the
film as one of the cops he's the bigger
guy with the bald head he's a cop and
this is joseline and chica we haven't
mentioned chica yet yes he was he was a
savior for this role we just could not
find anybody yeah he's great hard role
cast and Chiques actually a he's
spending a lot of stuff he's was he was
an orange is the new black as a guard
and a couple of episodes
he threw taylor schilling in the in the
clink the yeah yeah no not the clink the
hole the hole whatever a solitary is he
was in the Machinists he said last time
you talked with him yeah he chased down
christian bale as a cop and then he does
a lot of theater work as well perfect
role perfect actor for this room yeah
cuz we were I remember auditioning
people and they were doing like the 50s
b-movie thing yeah is like no but like
just played straight mm-hmm and she
could plays a straight great where he
makes everything funny because he's so
serious in this movie yeah
until Jackson is wacky I think this is
what he did in the first audition or
like that's great just do mad
have you seen samurai cop in an ideal
world this role would be Cameron
Mitchell but I don't think that's
possible for a lot of reasons mainly
because he's dead yes most reason do you
think if he is still alive we probably
could get him he probably would have
been in our movie maybe maybe so old now
I don't know well we're saying in a
theoretical sense if he were if yeah if
if he was still alive and he was doing
the type of movies he was doing when he
was still alive we could probably have
gotten him but we do have a lot of
booths here so that's true that's true
there's incentive
the star stupid star then we may I I
made that start from a mold we I
remember we had trouble getting it to
stay attached for the longest time yeah
it kept falling off it was too thick of
rubber to so because the arm arm little
arm things are sewn on to the vest so
those won't come off the shoulder rubber
shoulder things yeah but that star is
too thick I was like the original
original star wasn't it from like some
kind of Power Rangers toy and we're
afraid it was gonna be like a
recognizable thing I think so yeah we
just wanted our own we wanted to make
our own our own symbol yeah it's a
wonderful little effect the sandwich
here is the boss yes the famous boss
from pick and save grocery stores this
is the boss of you no one's the boss of
me rich there's Dale who made the masks
yes very nice Thank You Dale and there's
Rick pens ik again as officer Cunningham
yes he's a reverend sir Frank Allen no
but that's his second role in the film
is a distant relative makes perfect
sense yeah Rick was the hostage taker
yeah and yeah we repeated so desperate
for actors who repeated several of them
well that's good let's reuse you we make
it in with Tim Higgins though who plays
the mayor at the beginning he makes a
reference of his great-great-grandfather
being a bartender so when he shows up as
a bartender it just seems like a like a
clever joke with his mustache it would
have been weighed too recognizable
otherwise well the other option would
have been to cast somebody else but that
wasn't gonna how's it gonna have a good
find good actors anywhere we got lucky
to find the people we did for this movie
because like I said there's so many real
specific types of roles and we ended up
getting them but it was it was tough
yeah there's no real bad performances in
this well I'm not goofy other than rich
well in you and me yeah our two leads
are terrible well that's a term you know
I super nervous about starring in this no
you're great you telling me that but I
mean you know I'm just from my point of
view which is I got a I got a carry the
movie while also being monotone and dull
well it's it well you have to carry the
movie by not caring about anything
that's happening yes so it works you're
almost like the straight man in a way
you know and all the weird wacky stuff's
going on around you like you I don't
know it's like you're you yourself are
not funny in your performance it's yeah
I don't know it's a weird thing again my
character is more wacky which is it
shouldn't be it shouldn't work it
shouldn't be that way but it's reverse
yeah the the the incompetent cop from
the future should be more wacky and I
should be more straight and narrow okay
and said I'm like I act like a
psychopath I think it was just like just
ad libbing and just being trying to be
funny yeah well that's you have to have
also not caring what well you have to do
that because it's like if you were both
playing it straight right no it wouldn't
work like right rich has to be straight
because he's space cow but the joke is
that you know he's always fucking up
mm-hmm
while thinking he's a badass yeah he's
oblivious he's oblivious so like you
need someone in the duo to be funny and
that's neither of us no no this theme
this scene especially like and all the
times we've shown this the rough cut to
various people everybody thinks this is
the funniest scene and this is the scene
I think you thought most of this was
just gonna be on the cutting room floor
yeah this is like outtake material that
I kept in because it was funny yeah
there's like there's like a point where
I think I doing like four we would do
like 10 takes it just just to get the
lines down because I'm really bad at
remembering lines and I have most of
them Richard it's just kind of mumbles a
couple things yeah there and I have a
lot of longer lines and I can't i-i've
about trouble remembering them also we
do like ten takes and by the time we get
to take third
sort of like a wired or crazy you lose
your mind lose my mind a bit and then at
that point I could remember the lines
but I've done them so many times I feel
like tired of doing them and so I
started doing them in a almost like
sarcastic way too funny oh we got the
movie camera bits and then but that oh
yeah want to be in my rap video and
that's like of course I didn't think any
of this would make it in the movie why
did why didn't you stop me from cutting
it out of the movie then okay I don't
know what cuz once I saw it it's like
hey that's funny I don't remember that
yeah I mean that's the nature of improv
you just yeah and you do a bunch of
random shit and make it work in editing
there's so much stuff from the outtakes
that I just don't remember yeah I don't
know why there was a moving shot of you
going in the building what do you mean
the cat like the camera angle is moving
from the perspective of the video camera
I guess we were driving for following
you is that there was there was more to
that where you guys were driving around
so it tied in with that those this was
all around the time where there was a
whole sequence included oh my god like I
think in the three years making this we
rewrote the script like ten times yeah
we kept reworking it this bar sequence
was originally supposed to be a hidden
underground illegal gambling
establishment
yes that Jays character was running to
to steal money from people to fund their
operation and the original idea was um
we followed Jay into a back alley and
this is the moon barrel
oh yeah this is Tim Higgins the moon
mare and Jay went into this building and
we followed him in and this is where the
missus this is a DC comic book artist
Freddie Williams that's right
it was currently drawing the Batman
versus the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
crossover
well yes Freddie came out and this was
the same time we from the best of the
worst episode with him and he has a
small role here boys are saying before
you were so rudely interrupted well
ya know the gambling hall I was gonna
tell the story about when people called
the police on the space cop car oh yeah
no that already happened that we cut
that stuff out but there's one shot
where the camera is is it's like a
two-shot of you guys in the car and the
cameras like mounted to the car yeah
that was like a half a day of shooting
of you guys driving around right and
while we were driving around what
happened
well we we're like Jay was walking and
we're kind of like slowly following
behind him and that's the scene and then
you start you see that we're following
you
well yeah but but it wasn't related the
airport we're like in an industrial park
and there are people working and then
someone's like the real cops showed up
and then they're like someone called the
cops and they said there's a Arab man
with bombs on his car driving yeah
driving around the airport driving on
the airport and so so that means that
somebody saw the car decided that the
the plastic cannons on the front were
bomb and then further decided that if
that's the case then they must be you
know Arabs mm-hmm so they called the
cops cuz if somebody looks like an Arab
it's rich so they called the cops and
then like it probably thought this face
cop helmet was a turban yeah from from
afar who knows but yeah then the real
cops showed up and it was just like a
mistake like amateur hour mistake number
one but you know you should either get a
location release or call and let people
know but they showed up and thankfully
there wasn't like the FBI there or
anything considering the tip that was
called in but real the cops laughed it
off when they say live debate like as
they pulled up they saw the car you
could see it laughing and then the one
actually took a photo with rich yeah a
space cop and then they're like okay
they're like basically next time call
the police department and tell them
you're going to be driving around in a
weird ass car yeah but we did like those
few jokes yeah and then after that we
did we're like hey this is the worst
teleporter I've ever seen it's got a
range of one foot well you know they got
a limited means these aliens
this isn't their original plan so
they're kind of winging it here what's
what's our official reason to why GK
can't just buy the gold with his
company's money he bankrupted the
company making the quantanium okay I
know straight because people are gonna
ask these things nothing won't don't
care my I just want to be clear that we
have an answer the Iron Man shot
here's a Iron Man sequence this this bit
was more so going to be like a play on
the Iron Man stuff how Iron Man has so
much stuff going on in this helmet that
it it literally blocks his view and he
falls down and then it turned into spam
somehow I don't remember how but well
when we originally cuz this the the
shots of rich were done like two years
later the actual chase scene I think
that I think we made that up on the day
the idea that his helmet would start
getting all this shit yeah I think it
was just gonna be you guys just chase me
for a bed and the the the main thing was
the in the backyard when you you know
when you tackled me and then ridges up
but all this stuff with the helmet I
think we improved that on the day gotta
have jokes and then we hear and then two
years later we got the inside the helmet
cam stuff to tie it all together yeah we
had put a GoPro on the helmet in the
helmet yeah so it says in one of you so
it's actually cut with the other angle
of him falling down but then the inside
the helmet stuff of course has done in
us in the studio
I don't shut down as where's a horrible
scene for me because I have to do boob
read but I'm in an alley there's nothing
to do bouverie with there's like three
garbage cans yeah I think that's why we
started that's why we ended the ads in
events that's why we wasn't enough joke
we played that up more to make it work I
remember like looking at some of the
backyards and and just imagining this
like really long comical scene where
he's like knocking fences over and going
through people's houses and all this
like elaborate stuff that we obviously
couldn't do we can't go through PR yeah
I would have been something much more
that's a problem with with when we make
a movie it's like we'll have a script
but then we just keep adding things and
taking them away constantly to where the
final thing is like completely different
than how he started well that's that's
what I always say is low-budget
filmmaking is just an endless series of
compromises yeah the worst part about
making a movie is making the movie yeah
making the movie is a gigantic pain in
the ass it really is it's like
everything's working against you every
every time yeah well before we started
shooting this I was really like down on
doing it just because we have so many
failed auditions and while that was
happening we were also like putting the
space cop car together and it's like
everything was just like is this worth
it and then I think it reached a certain
point where we were just like not having
any luck with casting that I think we
just kind of said like okay let's just
start shooting like let's just start
shooting whatever we can and we'll
continue to try and find people as we go
and that's ultimately what ended up
happening would you say the biggest
challenge of making this movie was just
finding people um I think so cuz the
actual shooting was like like this stuff
is in the studio and it's a controlled
environment and we can you know and
we're not shooting like like 20 days in
a row you know like a regular scheduled
movie yeah we were shooting so
sporadically here and there that the
scenes we did shoot we could take our
time with for certain stuff especially
interior stuff but like we
mention the that chase outside obviously
we had limited means cuz we're out in
public and you know whatever but yeah
most of the actual shooting was not that
bad which is usually my least favorite
part that's usually where I'm like
stressed and I hate everything but with
this movie I think the most challenging
thing was just trying to get people that
would work for the parts
yeah well it's that and the secondary
challenge was the fact that it's a
sci-fi movie a sci-fi comedy and so
unlike like filming I don't know just
terms of endearment yes where it's like
just people in locations and stuff here
you have lots of props and sets yeah
miniature yeah there's so many spit like
this scene here it's just one shot of
you guys talking but it's like we need
all these police uniforms
mm-hm we need all this background action
well I mean this this is not the best
example
alien spaceship is a good example sure
but I mean it's every little detail like
oh yeah like those wanted posters on the
wall like we had to make those you know
every detail on all the police uniforms
we had to get all that together right so
it's all stuff that like if you're
watching it you're just like oh there's
you know police uniforms you kind of
take for granted that like we had to do
all of this ourselves mm-hmm every every
little element yeah I wanted to get the
cop uniforms good because that's one one
of my biggest pet peeves mainly if
you've seen the movie any time what
suburban sense ask oh those are great
those are great yeah a lot of times like
I don't know I mean we're talking a
different level of low budget but it's
like go to the order police patches get
the utility belts get all this girl the
gear and put it all together and make it
look as closest to reality as you can
and I think I screw it up is actually
sewing the patches on I did them on the
wrong shoulders oh god I cop patches are
on the left left arm no good and so
that's one detail that there's Josh aka
the wizard is it tied to Freddie
Williams and there's rich yeah which is
an extra in the bar
but yeah here's another one where it's
like you need someone specific to be
either a newscaster or a talk show host
and luckily someone showed up to the
auditions Denise here who was a talk
show currently is currently I saw her on
TV
okay she's on mom Milwaukee I can't
remember what it is but I was like oh
hey look who it is it's Denise is that
at the time she was trying to like get
into a different kind of acting and so
we cast her as a talk show host she
mentioned she you know wanted to do
acting and but that she has experience
as a newscaster okay we need a
newscaster we you know Easter as a
newscaster and Doc of the Dead as well
yep yeah yes a lot a lot of crossover
between those two with actors there's
that whole like post-apocalyptic war
scene and yeah the dead break up on all
that maybe some people maybe someday
you'll see it all that was amazing
contact exhibit a pictures that's them
where it's at oh god we haven't
mentioned the plant yet oh that plant is
the biggest star of the film yeah it's
it has the most roles in this movie keep
an eye out for that plan it shows up
everywhere the plant that's behind any
site right yeah that's uh that might be
a good drinking game for people every
time they find the plank when you see
the plant when the plant is in a scene
but yeah this was this was a there's the
best of the worst screening couches the
classic festival I like that that that
um whole sequence the TV diggety D and
the gold this was was a very late
addition to the movie yeah was that
replacing so I don't remember but I
can't keep track of all this shit I
guess you never finished talking about
the gambling hall I was really decided
to change that yeah I was bein mainly
bringing that up because it reminded me
of that that's the time when we were
shooting the stuff where we were
tracking you oh sure the cops came yeah
I think at least my biggest problem that
whole gambling hall sequence is that
there just weren't really any jokes in
it it wasn't there just like space cop
doesn't know how to play cards yeah kind
of it right it was sort of bland so it's
somehow things got changed around to
where I became a gold thief yeah my
character was at a different poker game
and I was like trying to get information
and space cop was like playing poker but
asking like dumb questions I don't
remember what was going and it becoming
convoluted yeah have a little bit stupid
so we got rid of it so we could have a
scene of endless gay jokes and thus
their sex puns sex puns I guess yeah gay
sex puns the gay sex puns yeah yeah I'm
not quite gay panic but no no it's it's
it's the classic you know someone walks
in the room yes what yes what they're
saying sounds like something completely
different but I believe the idea is that
it goes on so long and that's the joke
I'm not sure about that is that not that
you have no idea okay I think it's just
mostly I think it's just juvenile I was
driving Island terrible horrible doing
that I was a big supporter of cutting
the scene out in fact some of the
earlier edits I did cut it out but then
we did hold a little screening where we
showed a bunch of people the sequence
and I was I was voted against that it
should stay in people thought it was
funny so I love the puns democracy in
action that's yeah you know you gotta
make compromises there's it's the
cutting to the waiter it's it's it's a
pretty standard comedy setup cut to
somebody listening to the conversation
not not understanding what it's all
about right it's and that waiter Joe is
his name he's another one we're like
visually he sells that bit yeah it's
like you need again another specific
person mm-hmm that was an amazing effect
there in the car coming it's just
hanging there
these are charming effects will call
them charming
yeah I mean that was that was kind of
the goal was just to have all these real
classic low-budget effects there's the
plant oh yeah there's the plant again
should we point out the plan every time
or yes let people discover it for
themselves because I want to say there's
another plant in the movie in one scene
I can't remember where it is but they're
gonna confuse people there is a part the
part which would just sour which
stumbles into the bushes we actually use
that plant during fully - that's true
you can create the rustling of leaves
because there's too windy outside to do
it that's an audio cameo by the plant
your cameo correct it's looking really
sad these days there's the plant it's a
constant reminder of space Cobb did we
shoot the scene twice I think we reach
out the first half of it not the whole
scene right because originally you guys
were on the grounds mm-hmm and you were
you're yeah you're on the ground and
you're on a stakeout for me I'm trying
to remember what how this all went
together I think it came right after the
interrogation scene yeah there's some
clips in the outtake reel or the deleted
scenes real where it's an outtake it's
completely different
yeah well takes whatever it's
unfortunate got cut to because I think
especially in your guys's close-ups in
that it's probably one of the best lit
night scenes in the movie yeah where was
the scene we had to redo because the
dogs which which bit was that I think
that's everything that's half the movie
constant barking dogs
oh actually no that was the gambling
hall bed that got cut anyway
oh they got cut that was when they were
insane yeah yeah I think we were gonna a
tiara but then we just changed the
entire storyline on the movie instead
and I think this was all improv wasn't
it space cop talking about the story of
oh yeah after is yeah life's killer one
of those rare times I improv and it's
good ya know there's your head gets
stuck in the banister you step on a rake 
you know there's some good good little
dialog bits between us in this film down
the stairs it took three hours yeah it's
kind of crazy because I think that was
the entire idea was you know team you
guys up we'll do lots of improv it'll be
silly
and then it ends up with this big plot
and like tons and tons of visual effects
like endless visual effects this movie
was like a giant puzzle piece or giant
puzzle that's live all these little
pieces you got to fit together and make
work yeah this is what happens when you
expect rich Evans to improv a movie well
though the improv doesn't have anything
to do with it it's just like the and
that was the initial idea was to make
this you know low-budget sci-fi comedy
but to crank something out was the
original to craft something that was the
idea with feeding friends I'm kidding
but uh no this was meant to be a little
more planned out but the idea was that
it would be you know a comedy where you
guys could play off each other there's
enough of that which it no it is that
but it's in the backdrop of endless
special-effects yeah endless visual
effects well you know when we're talking
about the movie it's like what what do
you want in a space cop movie sure and
then one of the things that came up was
you space companies to try to pull
someone over and chase them you know and
then that leads into the alien plot
right when aliens need to be involved
it's outer space and need a flying car
flying ship spaceship spaceship and then
you start adding things you need you
need this scene where we
they go and they play good-cop bad-cop
and you need the scene in a strip club
like all the other tropes of cop movies
yeah you need the cranky boss you need
the cranky cranky boss exactly and all
that kind of stuff this lady was great
too was her name Deborah yep yeah we
used to run an episode of half in the
bag as well
that's right she was the yeah she's good
and that's I keep I guess I keep
repeating it now but like you need the
receptionist role rights to be very
specific right
you need the cranky receptionist who's
who you can't have your neighbor reading
lines poorly running right he would like
to see you now
the unfortunate thing about the
sequences this is a great lobby area
this was we rented this place right
there's like a building downtown where
you could rent rooms and we rented the
lobby area for this stuff and then they
go into Chiques office which he's the
CEO of the company but is this like
comically small little room yeah so each
I we rented that room and of course I
don't think we knew how small it was
gonna be until we got there well yeah
there was like two options there's this
and then like I think there's a bigger
office option but it was a ton of money
this is like a fake company building
where if like your fraud in a temporary
office to make it look like you're
successful you rent this place yeah and
they actually we didn't rent the lobby
area but I said can we just shoot in it
when now it was no kind of like yeah
after 5:00 no one's there go ahead don't
make a lot of noise or like okay great
oh that's right we had to shoot her on
the cleaning crew yeah they were like
coming down the aisle like big it was
like a horror movie with like they're
getting closer
yeah keep shooting before they get here
ago but we rented we rented the office
and I remember the door slam part was
like we kept slamming the bow yeah could
you take after take after take and I was
like oh god we're gonna disturb people
in the next
so the justification is that this is
just a little meeting room if someone
comes and wants to meet with with Agnon
this is the little meeting room which is
why there's music he's an alien he
doesn't understand why a CEO would be in
a big office
oh sure that's it maybe it's not like a
huge company no I guess not it could be
a smaller company he likes a small
office he likes the intimacy of a small
office he doesn't even want a computer
they're a fortune 500 thousand company
Oh 409 another setback with the scene is
when we got there we realized that there
was air conditioning blasting just
making tons and tons of noise mmm so we
we tried to shoot as much as we could
with the natural sound but we ended up
having to strip it all out and have all
improv yep or not improv ADR ADR which
was tricky because the scene was all
improv there was improv just that when
we did the adi there's a ton of improv
and that's what we cut the movie
together with and then that's tricky ADR
is tricky in general but replacing you
know improv with ADR is even more tricky
this whole space cops name thing just
happened and oh yeah the famous Holden
MIDI key scene nobody could stop
laughing yeah while you were doing this
yeah you'll get a sample of the actual
audio in the outtakes yeah how the
quality of it try to do as little a TRS
uni as possible because it's a big pain
but it's yeah it's it's a pain to get it
to match up but you need that clean
sound yeah it's better than the
alternative we're just horrible echo
noise you never want air conditioning
blowing or whatever there's still a
couple of questionable scenes in this
movie that I would have wanted to ADR
but there's nothing distractingly bad
like this scene was distractingly bad
though the the moonbase scene has a
little bit of an echo for me but well
there's there's scenes where there's an
echo where it feels okay you know or it
sounds like it could be natural right
now the Holden MIDI key name that
actually actually came from my fiance we
used to like to go to the minor-league
baseball game
we had season tickets and they had some
kind of contest thing where you could
like win a free ticket and they would
announce your name over the loudspeaker
and we already had season tickets so we
would join the contest but we would put
in like fake names hoping we can get him
to read like holding MIDI key over the
intercom hmm that's great where did the
the other name we had to possibility
when Helius makovan the other one was
Cornelius pick open fly where did that
go I think I just made that up okay
I don't know Oh in that plate that's
behind you guys it's the same plate
that's behind GK there
we just kept we moved it depending on
the shot oh is it yeah because that
table was empty Universal and background
oh yeah a little plant the others that
you talk about details there's a little
family photo you ever make that and then
there's the chromatin 'i'm like science
magazine like yeah which was an insert
that we shot later but and this he's a
print i gotta remember all your props i
think we did we bring the mms yeah like
yeah we bought those little candy dishes
at like the dollar so the intention of
him like and then we brought the bags of
M&Ms; yeah this was the intention was
that he would start like throwing this
up in the air and i don't know why
that's some weird thing that we would
think to do ahead of time it was my idea
because i was like reading this scene
before he did it was like space cop like
does nothing oh I gotta I gotta be doing
something okay I think I remember you
saying that yeah that makes sense and
now we have a fart joke what Michael do
you like to talk about the fart joke I
don't remember what the fart joke was oh
yeah you do yeah I don't even know I I
don't know why this is in here
you don't remember what your creative
process was when you're writing the
scripts and you put in space cop farts
for no reason because it's funny I came
up with because of poop line that's true
that was a rich improv my contribution
to schlock and here's my accidental
contribution to the schlock yeah this
was not supposed to happen when the
thermostat case falls off the wall
perfect it's a great yeah well I think
you were just slamming that door so hard
and that was probably like the cheapest
thermostat you know money can buy for
their fake office for their fake offices
we like to pretend they're successful oh
yeah finding other people yep rent an
office she gives the best reaction to a
fart and you possibly could give okay
now we talked about like difficulty and
finding people in difficulty here's
here's here's the thing when we film the
scene we let it let the word out all
right
strip club free beer four people showed
up yeah well that's not entirely true
let's talk about this this is this is
Milwaukee's finest strip club the
airport lounge and which is
coincidentally right next door to the
bar
oh yeah the landmark bar that you see
the landmark bar which is Milwaukee's
oldest bar the first bar in Milwaukee
these two places are right next door to
each other which was convenient for us
but the guy at the Milwaukee bar like
you know we paid him to use his location
and then we're like oh god you know the
strip clubs gonna cost us a lot to rent
it and I was but the the the family that
owns it was were very very accommodating
and very nice they were awesome yeah
they were just like oh that sounds great
you know come on in and we're like okay
well you know do wine money and they're
like no I said so compromise was we'll
open a bar tab and do that and where we
could not find extras for the life of us
well we had a few people lined up and
then the day of we got there in the
morning to start getting things set up
around the time that people were
supposed to show up as extras they just
didn't come yeah and well they they had
said the owner owners had said they
would get dancers who worked there to be
in the scene because you know we didn't
want actresses to do this and and with
the day of they're like oh no they
no-one's gonna show up they're like
these girls just sometimes don't show up
yeah great you know it's like we don't
have we don't have dancers and we don't
have patrons we don't have to we don't
have a CD basically we have yeah I was
kind of panicking this morning this was
one of the rougher days it was it was a
little frightening at first yeah then
then the owners are like well we have
friends that could come and so they a
bunch of people showed up and then all
of a sudden it was just like it worked
like yeah we ended up with two dancers
my friend Jesse showed up yes which is
great he has a prominent role as the
making it rain guy yep you might may
recognize him from the Phantom Menace
review you know he's uh he's on the
famous still and that's true he's in the
thumbnail for the episode 1 review
he's also eating ice cream and gorillas
interrupted yes oh yeah that's way back
yeah and then a couple of reused extras
and yeah the people sitting at the bar
were like friends of the club owners
basically a big thank you to the airport
lounge yeah yeah they were great they
were awesome they were really
accommodating but yeah that morning yeah
when nobody was showing up obviously
when they said that the the dancers that
they had asked to do it yeah
weren't calling them back and we're
great but it all worked out it ended up
working out how hard was it to like
frame these shots like just making
maximum use out of the people that we
did have
well we reused some people like a guy
directly behind mic there in the
reverses when joseline walks in he's
there to in a different hoody boot move
your people around to maximize the frame
and there's the plant and there's the
plant from its much younger day
when I had many more legs but this is
not this was not shot on location at the
airport lounge this is a set that we
built later yes clearly because it looks
like crap this is our Nicolas Winding
reference scene I think just bathed in
red it looks like only God forgives yep
and that's the samurai cop wig isn't it
it is we shot our interview with Matt
Hannon and we did a gag or a War of the
wig because that's obviously the famous
samurai cop thing and then we reused it
for for this this year we're at the home
movie no she just wears it in the
district now that's that's part of her
stripper disguise and though that's
something to mention is that
yeah she's wearing like this this
awkward Flashdance type outfit and
originally the original idea going way
back years before we had any sort of
script or even started putting the movie
together was that the aliens their
intention was to travel back to the
1980s that's when the scientist was
going to be there mm-hm and they you
know travel back to there on time like
it is now but they they don't understand
that they're not in the 80s so they're
wearing like bad 80's clothes everything
yeah preparation yeah yeah that's what
I'm studying yes they studied and and
had clothes yeah so there's gonna be
lots of jokes about them you know
dressed like like 80's attire and
basically been reduced to that yeah I
know it's just that she doesn't
understand things so she's wearing a
Flashdance outfit well I think I think
we also like it's not like they just
land the ship and get off right then and
there there's a there's a time gap yes a
time jump from 2007 to present day and
we're like well they they probably would
have figured things out and it wouldn't
make sense for them to still be wearing
their 80s close so we can I cut that we
mix that but for the sake of yucks we
still have the the Flashdance out yeah
well it also works and the fact that it
reminds me a little of Mars Attacks when
the the aliens are like human females
yeah walk all strange
Jocelyn's like dance stripper dances
like bizarre and
where she hasn't quite understand
doesn't get it and so she also doesn't
quite understand how a stripper would
dress right would wear some kind of
weird Jane Fonda outfit I say that's the
mating dance for people do right I
forgot what we called those aliens
commute new boo new Wow
I think we just made that up in kabuto
class its destroyer so the stuff here
the rain is our friend Jack on a ladder
with a hose which I'm gonna piss off we
had to film this twice first time I if
we did the hose on Mike it was like
perfect spray the hose directly up into
the air and the water comes down it
looks like rain right for some reason
when we did my shots that would be
really great just to spray the hose
directly down on me is that what
happened yeah I don't even remember and
I'm like are you sure that looks good
that's kind of look like crap and it was
freezing outside
it was cold water drenched on me and oh
yeah we're done you take a look at the
footage and it's obvious that there's
like a spotlight of water that's just
going on me did we have to redo it did
you redo it that night or definitely
like the next day I could have been the
next day I don't really remember but we
had to redo it
I was cold and wet twice I think it was
that night I think we wouldn't looked at
it okay I I don't remember at all damn
you Jack damn yo here's the the flesh
flesh creation the fleshlight flesh
creating machine in the the smaller
laboratory set that that you'll see on
the outtakes yeah there's a massive
destruction scene this was the last set
we had to build for the any of the alien
spaceship interiors so he's just added a
scene for the hell of it where it gets
completely trashed yeah but it's not the
movie but it's in the outtakes we we
laughed so hard when rich throws a dummy
through a wall later that you'll see
that we just said let's do more stuff
with the dummy
and then yes took it too far
we went too far in a few places we went
too far in a few places he's thrown the
dummy all over the place and they're
just trashing the second it's almost
like at one point the whole set wall
falls over I pull it down he pulls it
down yeah you see like a ladder behind
it yeah it just it just messed with the
whole like um momentum of the movie at
them yeah at that point you want to keep
things moving and here's Rich's second
role in the film uh-huh
third there was an extra oh that's right
yeah you're an extra in the BART so this
is the same door that we just came out
of yeah
rearranged my riches bottle of not Jack
Daniels that he drinks in his car later
oh and Freddie Williams is in the
background over Rich's shoulder they're
doing actual work actually drawing a
comic book right there I want to say he
said he was working I can't it's Thor I
mean a Thor book yeah yes and he sent us
a copy of that but that's at he's
actually doing double-duty he's working
as an extra and he's working at a real
job that's how you do it that's yeah
yeah that's him Higgins
he was in the very first episode of half
in the back oh yeah that's right played
one of Lucas's henchmen that come in and
smash up the we go way back with Tim
Higgins quality quality always reliable
and he played the hipster and the
hipster V CRM persona the hipster
trilogy episodes yeah he only wanted to
pay with tons of JFK half-dollar and he
signed in with a quill and because he
doesn't support the big pen industry
but a lot of work with with Jack to his
past me a beer video oh that's true I
think yeah that's how we met him I
believe was through Jack I want to say
this was one of the first see first
thing there was a one of them the first
thing we shot no no no it wasn't the
first the first thing we shot is the
last shot of the movie oh well actually
it's the first thing we shot with space
cop
the very first thing shot for the movie
is the girl undressing on the TV during
the Snodgrass scene you're right I
forgot about that last scene we shot
that and then we shot that was the first
thing but the girl on the TV you shot
that yeah and that was the first thing I
was the very first thing that was like a
few days before we shot I remember their
rich yeah you're doing that like mid
production no no that was super early
okay yeah then we filmed riched in the
door and then then kind of this was the
first major scene did we shoot the crowd
scene before this no no that was like
the next summer no was it it was like
September of 2000 the very one of the
very first things we shot I thought it
was the first but you're ready to do
them oh wait you know what this was
first cuz this is when we didn't have
the costume quite together yet mm-hmm
like he can see he doesn't have his
little insignia yeah collar yes and the
star kept falling off and the star kept
falling off yeah I think the star kept
falling off though because he was kept
pouring booze on his shirt and yeah okay
kept losing I think we just had it on
with like duct tape at this point and
that's why I kept falling yeah yeah
because we're smart and this this scene
is not crucial to the plot but it's like
a scene that you could cut if you're
trying to get the running time down but
I would Ryan it was yeah this this is
one of the funnier concepts of this is I
think this is officially my favorite
scene of the movie space cop drunkenly
drunkenly chasing after an
eight-year-old boy all the kids try to
get away on his bike and but it makes
perfect sense he's saving his wife this
is a noble thing
but we learn at the end of the movie
it's a causality loop that intentionally
causes the death of his wife yeah I
think it's good that there's some time
travel paradox a little bit yeah time
travel movie now this is a great touch
here the guy that did this effects I
made the bike go flying up into the air
so here's another shot where we only had
two tubes two cryo tubes and we had to
move them around and do split screens
you see the paint coming off the one
there's a green don't point those things
out rich they're gonna run the magic of
the movie it's gonna take people out of
their immersion I'm sorry I'm sorry this
guy was good this is yeah this is Bo
Johnson whoo-whee this stuff we kept
pretty much to the script because it's
like exposition city mm-hmm so we didn't
do a lot of improv and then I found out
after the fact he was a member of the
dead alewives which was a famous comedy
troupe in Milwaukee it's like where Dan
Harmon got his starred and robbed robbed
and and he was a part of that group
which was an improv group and had I
known that at the time we shot this so
maybe would have tried to get him to do
more improv but this place he just plays
scientist man but his acting is good but
that's yeah it's okay because you can't
have a lot of jokes in this part at
least on his end right like you're the
comedy relief of these scenes right he's
got a lot of information to get across
right and I just ask questions and we
have a little bit we're pouring
chemicals into a glass you know you got
to break up the exposition with that
stuff
yeah people get bored during exposition
so you have to kind of distract them
throw M&Ms; in the air with your mouth
right
those are good gags though do a
spit-take at one point that's the second
time you drink chemicals yeah
but this is yeah so that's a shot
specifically before this that wasn't
just like part of your personal
collection that was a part of my
personal collection yeah yeah yeah but
that's you got to get that like it's a
one second joke
he has pervert tapes so you got to shoot
that and then you have to shoot the
inserts of the TV with that on the TV
which we did not shoot with him there
it's like all these pieces yeah that's
like Hello or something right yeah
that's my shoulder it's the standin why
didn't we do that with him because we
didn't have anything ready yeah we
didn't want to have to worry about
hooking up the vcr and getting the tape
cued up and all that stuff okay okay and
it's like it's like let's get everything
we need him for right and then you get
those inserts later yeah you could have
him stand there and have him film his
shoulder with the TV in the background
but that is like a waste of his time you
gotta light it yeah set it up yeah
exactly that's an hour that's the kind
of thing that I'm a bigger film they
call second unit yes
shots of space cops car driving through
downtown Milwaukee all that stuff you
could have somebody else shoot but
close-ups of people holding things in
their hands yeah that's yeah generally
that's not the same actors hand and okay
right I think the the the outfit here
the hoop earrings and the ponytail to
the side is our very very pathetic
attempt to make it seem like this is the
same lady from the 1980s yeah although
it ended up getting reworked where
they're not trying to travel back to the
80s they're trying to travel back to
2007 so it doesn't really make sense
that she would be a tease anymore but I
think that changed like mid production
hmm after we shot that so I'm sorry
their 2007 yeah cuz space cops lasers
messed up their equipment I can't keep
track of these things so the the
scientist was killed in 1985 right so
that is supposed to be so why it's the
same lady who looks the same is beyond
me I guess it's her mother no it's just
hurt it's just her it's just her it's
fine age
incredibly well sure what classic what
now these walls for this little set are
also the alien spaceship walls I think
this was shot first because those walls
are clean two of them are real walls
well yeah the brick walls are real but
then we had the we only have one fake
wall here but on the outside of that
room stuff there's two yeah and that was
their brand-new they were smooth they
were clean so we shot this stuff before
we started like gluing shit to him for
the alien now when we film like the
outside of this room looking into I mean
that's the same walls flipped around yes
we had to repaint them because the back
you just see the wooden frame yeah
exactly yeah I guess we would have done
that that same day because we shot them
outside of that room in the cryo lab
area yeah and then we must have told
them to go take five or something and
just flip the wall I remember that's
that's an easy generally worked with him
for one day
yeah the grand ones no no I'm wrong I'm
wrong no no this is the remnants of the
phone booth gag if you're wondering why
he's at a phone booth III like it now
better
it just feels appropriate like that's
how my character would contact space guy
Sharon but originally I was supposed to
run up to like a kid who was like I'll
tech the tech tout with an iPad and
headphones and you know and I say kid
where's the nearest phone booth and then
the you know it's an obvious setup for
him to go a lot but really he just knows
exactly where one is it's a yeah it's a
it's a double joke yeah as a
bait-and-switch more or less and then um
we shot it and it didn't quite work
there's something about it that that
didn't I yeah I don't think the joke
came across clearly or something yeah we
really needed like three kids and we
needed them all to be super into it yeah
everybody's on their phone everyone's on
their phone or playing this game and
it's and then
it just didn't read visually read yeah
and so we cut it that airplane was just
the model airplane you know just a plane
on the strings where'd you get these
clouds that's I shot that myself I went
up and I rented a helicopter for the day
and I went up and shot that coming up we
have another Colin shot yeah the plane
debris landing the funny part is he was
working on that shot
literally on 9/11 oh that's right yeah
and it just was coincidence that he
happened to be working on that shot on
that day yeah and people in his office
were like what are you doing
I'm sick oh it just just just happened
to fall on that day that's terrible
it is terrible this is the only time all
three characters are together right yeah
only time in the movie
no there you don't have any scenes with
Jocelyn right uh other than this no oh
wait no I have the the the first cryo
lab shootout scene oh it's me in here
that's right I just forget that cuz
they're wearing masks yeah it's you're
on the scene well knowing you got that
other scene with GK - nevermind yeah
we're all in scenes just not all
together it's it's two of us in any
given scene except for this one
do you remember what that the the golden
cortex thing was made of rich felt it
was an ice cream maker I found at a
thrift store and then I just glued a
whole bunch of shit to it and separate
painted it gold yeah and then they make
it spin I just connected it to a drill
and just spun it in front of a green
screen
oh is that hey did he just have a drill
yeah oh my god its the famous had knelt
scene yeah Jay had you had found a Taco
Bell Cup topper from the Phantom Menace
of era from episode 2 of Mesa wooden do
know it was episode 1 oh yeah oh yeah
he's in he's in then but then yeah it
was a Taco Bell promotional tie-in with
episode 1 so I found it shortly before
we were planning to do that effect we
were talking we weren't sure how we were
gonna do it yeah rich had made a
full-scale clay head yeah that was at
one time we're gonna try and melt a head
he used the wrong clay and it started to
crack and fall I used the right clay but
we waited too long okay and what
happened was the styrofoam I built the
head on top of I built it on top of them
like I'm Sarah from mannequin head yeah
that sucked the water total moisture
yeah how's that what happened yeah okay
oh yeah and then I just happened to find
in my parents basement this old cup that
had been down there since 1999 yep and
he said hey let's melt this actually was
my idea to melt it okay but it worked
great but I need a really nice hat you
showed up with it and you're like oh I
just said like hey look what I found and
then you had the idea to do it I was
like hey let's use this this looks just
like chica there's another oh yeah yeah
this too that's amazing it really helps
cuz the set was so small it's supposed
to be this big engine room and it's just
this tiny set mm-hmm
so these these extensions they helped
establish the room a bit more imagine
that that shot zoomed in four times yeah
that was the engine rooms roughly this
but yeah and that's our engine that's
the biggest thing we could make I think
we were talked about having some kind of
thing where there was like a glowing
ball of energy
mm-hmm and it was that like oh that's
right yeah an effect would make it look
bigger but we found a bunch of crap
a thrift store and I like yeah let's
just make some kind of device was like
worded a glowing thing I think lighting
would have been an issue was that
everything I don't and it would have
created yet another visual effect all
these visual effects that are science
fiction movie hey you're not the one
that had to do all just the last year of
my life has been painstakingly trying to
do this crap when you peanut butter
tastes like peanut butter J what and I
don't make the peanut butter I'd
complain if I had to make the peanut
butter I can go to the store and buy
peanut butter and then I can go to
another store and buy a sci-fi comedy
but I didn't have to make would you ever
make another sci-fi comedy um not if I
knew that I would end up having to do
most of the visual effects and I think I
don't think when we were shooting we
realized how much it was gonna be either
can we talk about the control panels for
a second oh god yeah which is an epic
tale into itself rich did a wonderful
job making those control panels the tops
of them making like a little glowing
buttons and all that but those control
panels were old CD racks at this this
store and Milwaukee I posted on
Craigslist free you know CD racks like a
great those are great
they're like the perfect size and shape
there at like a comic book they read
later I forget what their world of
wonder yeah it's next door to science
and surplus that's right
and so we rented a truck and took it
over there and then we picked one up and
it was about 900 pounds
they were extremely heavy I took like
eight 15 we did a ton maybe hanhan at
the minute eight or ten yeah and and it
took us like six hours to load them into
the truck I know they were so heavy and
in awkward like they were hard to get
onto a dolly properly right right and so
I think you had to gut them right
rich yeah you gotta them up okay I go to
them with a hammer or a saw and then
originally I wanted to put like
styrofoam on top but that was just too
light and anything you put on it would
have caved in
right so then I just I took some plywood
and I cut holes in it and then I put
hole I put up styrofoam things with with
Jo cutouts on top of that eeeh but
longboard foam board and and and film
and light gels yeah and then we threw
them in the back of her studio to rot
and inside that CD case is just like a
big giant like ceiling florescent light
right yeah that's right it's the whole
thing up so here's one of the most epic
scenes in the film one of my favorite
scenes in the movie with another
celebrity cameo yeah yeah and hopefully
you're not watching the movie with the
commentary track first nobody I don't
think people do that right nobody ever
does that all right yeah this is I mean
if you're dumb enough to do that we're
gonna spoil that Len cab Basinski makes
his cami over here
why would you just spoil it for me rich
the epic showdown between rich and Jay
and the insert lenka Basinski is rich is
obvious stunt double not only the stunt
double but also the fight choreographer
yes and he did a great job I mean if you
look at like mean rich like we don't
know what the fuck were doing when it
comes to fighting but there's a couple
moves that are somewhat convincing it's
a fun action-packed scene he was telling
ya he's telling us like specific angles
to shoot it from to cell like I think
it's when he kicks me in the stomach and
all those little bits
no that was completely one but this is
another scene that basically was
completely silent no usable audio
whatsoever
and it's all like Foley and ADR yes and
sound effects so it's like rich and Jay
we're on microphones like imitating
their moves with their clothing making
grunting noises
and adding punching sounds and I think
it all worked out pretty well I think I
think having that cuz for the longest
time we would watch this scene over and
over with just the you know the the
scratch audio mm-hmm
once you put that in and you hear like
Rich's voice coming out of the shots of
Len like that that sells it yeah that's
funny you know I don't think I've seen
this with the the ATR yet oh that's good
unfortunately watching this unmute right
now so I still have the same day but
some day some days I might show you the
final movie rich some day
do I get a copy of the movie no no you
got a buy one oh and here's a dummy how
could you tell that was a pain in the
ass to that dummy oh my god trying to
get to prop up properly it was it was
very like awkward and yet out on a
wooden stick and a wooden stick shoved
in the ass and III was puppeteering that
and you were up on a ladder yeah I had
the like the upper torso held up with
like fishing wire and I think I I
dropped it too and to have a go limp and
then you pulled it yeah so it almost
looked like it was collapsing yeah
collapsing and then standing upright and
then collapsing and being pulled to the
left and it was just something that was
looking really hard to do now here we
have Mike's character earth he he learns
to listen to a woman yeah he learns the
little wooden repair a car space cop
Sark is that he has no art yeah yes
space cop learns nothing in this fella
that yeah the joke is you know Mike's
character keeps trying to put it in your
head that you need to use your wits you
need to use intelligence to solve a case
and and the end of the movie you save
the day by just punching something dumb
blunt for someone force it's it's an
anti arc yeah that was the second take
the first take it didn't go all the way
through the head fell off and everything
went wrong
second take it flew through there
perfectly and many thanks to our three
aliens here
Jack Jeff and Jesse yeah Jesse again
from the strip club scene yep just
circuits yeah all all willing to have
firecrackers tape to their body condoms
and green blood although those those
chest things are like padded yeah
there's one for like bike riders yeah
but still like and and it was nice that
backlight you can see a little tip
bleeding in from the top it's backlit so
the blood spurts yeah really show up
nicely say what the smoke this is all
nice-looking stuff this mid hallway
pillars they really yeah he'll hide the
fact that it's just these same walls
right yeah those helped quite a bit
yeah you made those right yeah yeah you
did a nice job with those things they
really make it look sci-fi I mean yeah
this movie is basically made of
styrofoam styrofoam and duct tape
there's really nothing else the head
came off that's fine that's great was
that spine was that the remnants of that
full skeleton that we had at one point
you know that's all it was left
those are heaven brain in the jar it's
adorable although this robot
I remember you're just a robot J oh yeah
I don't think I had quite in mind what
we intended to do with the robot so my
original robot was a turned upside down
tote it was like a plastic bin yeah like
a plastic bin and then I glued a bunch
of shit to it it didn't have a head like
you know we've got the brain in the jar
I don't even think it had that it was
like it was like a plastic bin unlike a
computer chair yeah it was it was I
remember I think we got it at a thrift
store it was like a like a beauty salon
hair dryer thing on wheels
yeah and so I took the wheels part of it
and I put the bin on top of that we
eventually and it was it was it was his
repeat it was it was very small my
original like I drew it out and kind of
mocked up what it should have been and
it like would have required five
puppeteers comical failed well I think
we had five puppeteers for this thing at
some points yeah there was there was one
shot that's not in the movie here where
we had everybody there was no one
running the camera because everybody was
doing something we had the actors in the
shot and then everybody else was
puppeteering the robot so we had
absolutely nobody even a man the camera
yeah we needed like to either two people
or four people holding sticks with
strings for the tentacle arms the shot
isn't in the movie yeah it was yeah it
required everybody I just remember I
originally wanted these big giant vulgar
pummeling arms yeah yeah just beat the
shit out of space Cobb well
unfortunately stan winston's dead and
none of us are up to the task this is
the best we could do this works in a
slot comedy oh yeah just a brain and Jar
that's a fine villain this is fine good
enough the movies about terrible jokes
[Laughter]
it's a common yeah it would be a
completely different story if we were
trying to make a serious you know
heretic sci-fi film but the comedy comes
first and sometimes the comedy comes
from the cheapness of the way everything
looks space cop almost killing everybody
by rushing into this room he never would
have had the gun yeah that's true yeah
we solved the problem and then you just
made it worse
Jocelyn's uh this is a 90% chance of
working I don't like those odds
mr. Spock reference what's the mr. Spock
reference Ethel the thing he looks in on
the enterprise this is the only time we
use those lights in the gun for I think
so I think so aside from Colin's opening
credits scene there's a close-up of them
blinking yeah that's because it's in
like super power mode yes yeah he's
draining the power core completely put a
little blue light in there and
everything I don't even know if it shows
up does it show up huh yeah okay yeah
you can see it oh well time making that
so mr. Spock reference goddamn it now
everybody did spark that woman it's
always losing his temper and beating
people yeah right I want Spock dead now
yeah spot aspects that enraged violent
violence mongers I saw the movies I know
he's the one that's always beating
people up and choking them
timing on this was perfect and you can't
even see the strings sure you can
what it's fine so here's our epic crowd
scene oh my God look at all of those
people and thank you people for showing
up yeah yeah thank you everybody that
showed up for this there's like it was
like 12 years ago now but we appreciate
it people came from my comically far places
there's two guys that drove from New
Jersey so a special thank you to you two
guys so you can sit on a bench for a
couple hours well we made it very I made
it very clear in the email to people
like we're shooting a scene this isn't
like some sort of you know
meet-and-greet or we're gonna hang out
like we got work to do you know
everybody understood that and everybody
was was great well yeah I mean we still
talked to people afterwards and stuff
but I mean really this scene should be
you know downtown Milwaukee hundreds of
people but it's fine you do what you can
do i I think I looked into renting like
larger locations I remember we were
looking at some place downtown yeah and
one place said no I've looked at some
place on the Summerfest grounds they
said no they wouldn't get back to me
they just kept blowing me off
so whatever oh and there was Sammy
holding the you owe me five bucks sign
which this was the first thing shot he
wasn't even cast in the movie at that
point he just showed up to this mm-hmm
even shot him first yeah that's what I
mean I first thing shot with him and
he's holding up that you owe me five
bucks sign just because we thought he
was funny he had like this sour look on
his face and then I wanna say he was
yelling things too that were kind of
funny okay maybe I don't remember but
then we ended up using him as space cops
partner officer partner which I don't
think we say his name in the movie but
and so we added a line or he says space
cop says I bet you five bucks this is
another false alarm so you would set up
that sign mmm-hmm and this the you owe
me five bucks thing was just a random
gag now here's the fair one of the very
first scenes this is the first thing
shot with rich ass space cop
and it's a recreation of a shot from the
old original space cop thankless fucking
job yes true and there's an alternate
ending where space cop just throws the
key to the city on the ground yes
whatever but thankless fucking job after
thousands of people so thank you it's
appropriate for space cop but you know
what the movies not over yet
the area of our Marvel mid credit
sequence or we reveal that little Timmy
is gonna grow up to kill space cop's
wife then we know that because of the
scar on his face which space cop
mentions earlier yeah he's crippled
mister blink it's a wheelchair it
actually is a child-size wheelchair that
we just use cuz that's what we got
originally yes whatever reasons link it
as a tiny wheelchair very horrible to
fit in yeah for me but that space cop
do you remember remember when we had to
get the vending machine that we didn't
even use in the movie oh my god that's a
whole nother story
and speaking of heavy things we had to
move there's gonna be a scene where got
punches through a vending machine to get
to the the chips inside I was gonna be
whole gas station shootout there's gonna
be a gas station shootout at one point
that got replaced by the hostage taker
yes which is probably a better scene on
the whole it's funnier yeah yeah I mean
the the the that scene would have been
just mindless destruction which sets up
space cop as a character too but as it
is now it works yeah cuz there's like
obviously the moon scene parallels the
hostage scene in the past right right
let's see I'm a space cop I feel like we
haven't even touched the surface of all
the things that went into making this
movie but thank you to everybody that
helped make the movie and thank you to
anyone that is watch the movie oh you're
welcome
not you rich oh my god but I helped make
the movie I guess by everyone thank you
what
