action
cockroaches like y'all ladies a hippie
name we got three puzzles there
I've been working on the puzzles instead
of bugging unless you guys like being
eaten by cockroaches you know what this
is right to call it a straw goofy
listen you can use the bin my plastic
bin to help yourself up
but don't comically knock over the
plastic friend while you can
thirty seconds 60 seconds come on you're
coming with me to my living room Oh help
me write my dick come on you filthy
hooker angel what's going on here we are
applying makeup for the purpose of fun
okay he's trying to get back to his
roots
Oh doing uh a follow-up to the the
infamous episode 1 review basement
sequence this time there's two the first
one was a hooker this time there's two
girls that were picked up outside of a
club by Plunkett not hooker not hookers
just I mean is this really a Star Wars
movie is it the same people that made
this crap it's a Sherlock movie it's a
piece of shit
no man this shit's real I ain't playing
with you the same people that made it's
amazing on fucking real - piece of shit
get me some revenger that's it baby
put it in put it in episode three all
the way
have you ever been married give me wives
well I had three of them actually but
they all died and tragic unrelated
accidents oh that must have just been
awful having all three of your wives
died tragically yeah sure I guess
you know Bambi was the hardest though
because I found out she was lying to me
right before she killed herself in the
bathtub huh but that's life I guess so
it goes you know things make a little
more sense when you've dealt with death
and Star Wars prequels hmm is that why
you make these reviews to help you cope
no how about you now I know that you
have a dead baby a baby
um but did you have a husband oh yeah
yeah he left me then I had to support
myself you know my lifestyle my
lifestyle you mean drugs right yeah I
had to work on the streets you know I
had no choice yeah yeah and you probably
hope to someday meet a man who would
provide for you right Yeah right like
take care of you yeah that ain't
happening let me let you in all those
secret negging all guys lie all men lie
everybody lies oh yeah I know what
you're talking about I guess we all
project ourselves to be somebody we're
not especially George Lucas
