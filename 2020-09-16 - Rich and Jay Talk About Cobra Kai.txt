Well, Rich, are you ready to talk about a franchise revival, nostalgia-driven soft reboot that doesn't suck?
I know.
I just got done watching the first season of Picard.
Have you seen the show?
I fucking hate you.
Welcome to Jay and Rich talk about a streaming exclusive TV show, episode number two.
Yeah, we could talk about The Boys season two, but they're releasing episodes weekly.
I know, I was so disappointed when I heard The Boys 2 was out.
Yeah.
Oh, no, it's not really out yet.
Yeah, it's disappointing, but it's also like people are review-bombing it now, and giving it all like one-star reviews.
For that reason?
For that reason.
Interesting.
Which is really, really lame.
I can understand being disappointed, but--
Yeah.
That's pretty stupid.
Yeah.
Well, to be fair, the weekly format sucks.
Yes.
As it does for most shows now.
We're past this.
We're in a new era.
Is the term TV show dead?
Uh, it's not just for lack of an alternate term.
You just call, eh, it's a TV show.
It's on my TV.
Or we're gonna just start calling these things just series.
I guess.
Yeah.
It'll still be called a TV show, until our generation dies off.
Well, that's gonna happen soon.
Not soon enough.
Look, look, look, it's old age or coronavirus.
We're gonner.
okay good
hey where you going come here I didn't
know you guys were trying to buy beer
hey watch your car man it's a really
pleasant surprise
isn't it yeah well and it's we're
talking about it now because a lot of
people are only just now discovering it
because it was
a youtube premium show formerly youtube
red
so if you tried to recommend it to
somebody like hey you should watch the
show Cobra kai
and they're like oh is it on netflix no
is it on amazon
no and they say oh it's on youtube red
and then their eyes just glaze over and
they stop talking to you i'm gonna
defend youtube red
I know I know ad blockers are a thing
but the reason I got youtube uh red at
the time and I got it before Cobra kai
you know what I didn't mind guilt-free
ad-free videos on youtube
yes I don't want to sound like i'm
shilling for youtube bro the only reason
i'm bringing that up is because I did
not
get youtube premium for Cobra kai right
me either and I don't think i've watched
a single other youtube original program
outside of Cobra guy
yeah but I mean my reaction to like
his here's the karate kid new
reboot and i'm like the fuck do I give a
shit about the karate kid
for yeah it's actually kind of good that
it premiered on youtube premium because
your expectations are so low
that it was a pleasant I mean it's a
good show but it would it was a pleasant
surprise
from like oh direct to youtube
karate kid revival
because there's one franchise I don't
give a shit about or one franchise that
didn't even need to be a franchise
it's the karate kid my history with the
karate kid
was I saw the original when I was young
it was good
I saw the second one I was done
yes I haven't seen a single karate kid
film past the karate kid 2.
well there oh no there's I was gonna say
there's only two but there's three
because then there's part three there's
the next karate kid
with hilary swank and then there's the
will smith
sun reboot with jackie chan I hadn't
seen I watched the first season of Cobra
kai without having seen
any karate kid movies really not even
the first one not even the first one but
I mean it's one of those movies that is
you know the whole movie just through
cultural osmosis
yeah yeah like I know Cobra kai I don't
sweep the leg
put him in a body bag wax on wax saw i
knew the whole movie
and so now after finishing the second
season I went back and watched all the
movies
uh just for context sake and after the
first movie I was like
that was good I didn't need to watch it
it's just one of those movies you know
the whole fucking thing
so going into the the series I had no
real expectations I just kind of watched
it just to see what like
a youtube original could be like one
that feels more like a show
because a lot of that youtube stuff
youtube original stuff looks like
just other youtube videos you know i'm
not sure why they're
they're premium or whatever um
but within the first episode I was like
this is really good the first episode
hooked me because like i
I put it on as a lark because I had
youtube red and it's like well I don't
know that's all this hype i'll check it
out
and uh I think the thing the first thing
the show did
that is kind of amazing to me is uh how
quickly it rehabilitated the character
of
johnny lawrence yes when when I was a
kid and I watched the original karate
kid
he was the biggest asshole on the face
of the earth well he's
he's the quintessential 80s movie bully
yes and that's whenever people talk
about and
that's kind of like because the show
isn't brilliant it's not deep or
anything but what it does it's really
interesting is
yeah it does it recontextualizes the 80s
movie
bully like and that's embodied in the
the johnny lawrence character but every
80s movie had that the generic
one-dimensional bully
what are you looking at butthead and and
it got increasingly
more absurd as the decade went along you
haven't seen karate kid 3 right
I doesn't doesn't crease like hire like
a cia guy to
take out danny no not exactly
but all the villains in that movie are
so absurd they feel like they're out of
a spoof movie but what happens is
it turns out and they kind of ignore
this on the new show Cobra kai is not
just like
a karate dojo that was run by kris oh no
it's it's a karate school owned by a
multi-millionaire
that also runs all these big like
industrial
you know companies and stuff and when he
finds out that
Cobra kai lost the karate tournament in
the first movie
his life's ambition is to get revenge on
this
child that beat a Cobra kai student
and so the whole movie it's like like a
looney tunes thing he's like the wily
coyote
it is so insanely stupid that it's
actually worth watching
it's so bad oh god I was actually
shocked at how bad it was
when i'm finished with that kid he'll be
begging me
to be his teacher and you know what he's
going to learn from me
pain in every part of his body and fear
in every part of his mind
and it's just like because you always
think like in the first movie it's like
oh it's just
this crease guy it's his dojo or
whatever yeah so they kind of go back to
that with the new
with the new series yeah but that but
yeah that idea the the bully
and that's something that I know has
kind of been like a tongue-in-cheek
sort of fan theory is the idea that
johnny lawrence was actually the
the uh the victim in the original movie
and daniel is the aggressor
because he's he's the one that's
constantly antagonizing him yeah even
when they back off
and sort of take that and and kind of
flush it out into an actual show
and make everybody feel like real
characters it's pretty impressive
yeah yeah they managed to make johnny
likeable in like five minutes
that first episode of Cobra kai if you
do nothing else check it out
the first episode is amazing it's a
little absurd that
so many characters on the show their
entire life is uh
kind of been the the defining moment in
all their lives
is this karate championship that they
had when they were children
that's the l bundy that's a thing that
happens doesn't happen to everybody
that's true
it works for johnny lawrence his
character but then less so for daddy
less so for daniel's son and definitely
less so for chris who they introduced
well
at the very end of the first season but
he's a primary character in the second
season
yeah it's like why does he care about
this shit so much to be fair I think
he's a psychopath
I think uh I don't know the actor's name
that plays chris yeah martin cove said
in his head the backstory for the
characters that he's a vietnam vet
who couldn't handle losing the vietnam
war okay
and so he cannot tolerate losing in any
fashion anymore even
even when it comes to a stupid little
karate dojo okay
yeah I don't know what shit you went
through back then but these are good
kids
and they don't need to relive our
mistakes
the second season in general isn't as
good
no I I think though in the first season
I I I love most of the kids
miguel is great yeah well that's
something else the show does is
it introduces because it's like the new
trend of soft reboots which I guess kind
of started with the force awakens so
it's like
you have your legacy characters and they
kind of usher in the new characters
you know these younger people and in
this you introduce the two kids and
you're like okay this is going to be
johnny lawrence this is going to be
daniel all over again and they yeah but
then they they shake it up a little bit
and they keep it interesting
it's remixed a bit because we focus on
the Cobra kai faction
yeah yeah and I think miguel and johnny
just have a
a a really good relationship where they
they're both kind of improving each
other yeah like like johnny
he's he's a dick but he's a likable dick
and we
want to see him become a better person
yeah he's he's the anchor of the entire
show
yeah and and miguel is kind of just
facilitating this
at the same time johnny is kind of
mentoring miguel and giving him
confidence right the problem I guess
we're jumping into the second season a
bit
sure a second season just kind of
fails in some degree for me just because
it becomes less about that relationship
which is kind of the heart of
season one yeah and more about
uh johnny's dojo versus danny's dojo
yeah it turns into like the west side
story well the other thing too is it
introduces lots of little like teenage
melodrama
yeah and the real the real villain of
the entire series is karate
because anytime any of the characters
are on the verge of
understanding each other or having some
sort of personal breakthrough
a silly karate fight breaks out all the
drama is just reset
which is kind of amusing there's an
aspect of the show that is sort of
unintentionally funny
it's a good show in general but there
are these these kind of moments that
a lot of times it's a very lighthearted
show but when it tries to get like
really serious
it tends to come off a little silly it's
it's hard to believe
that modern teenagers would
would take karate that seriously
yeah and and it makes sense that someone
like johnny lawrence would
yeah because he's the he's that classic
like uh best of the worst filmmaker that
we always talk about
who just thinks he's a badass and karate
is badass so if you open up a karate
dojo
you're going to be the ultimate badass
and that's where a lot of the humor from
the show comes from is yeah that
like I said the kind of generational
difference between the way he views
things and the way the younger
characters do
one of the big themes is fathers and
sons yeah
because miguel is johnny's replacement
son
because johnny really fucked up raising
robbie yes
you kind of forget that robbie is his
real son for a lot because they barely
bring it up
especially in the second season it
happened so infrequently that when he
there is some mention of it is like oh
yeah like I just kind of forgot
and then danny starts raising robbie
like a son
uh parental figures like crease was i
guess kind of that for johnny lots
lots of that going on and it's all
pretty well done but then everybody
breaks out in karate fights
that second season the end of the second
season the the big school fight that
goes on forever
is funny it's entertaining but it's it's
pretty ridiculous
it kind of breaks your suspension of
disbelief that in a
a really nice school this ride
rival karate dojos are gonna break out
into a school-wide fight and it's not
gonna be broken up immediately
I hate oh god I don't remember his name
though
who's that new character in season two
the adult that joined the scuba guy
oh funny fat bearded man funny fat
bearded man who's not funny
that's a complete flat line cringe phil
yes yes
I don't even know why they he shows up
in in one episode just working at the
hardware store
I was like oh okay there's like a
one-off character in that scene yeah
because he's like 80s because uh
johnny's wearing like is it like a
metallica shirt or something
something like that and he's like yeah
80s best decade and then he
mentions that he was born in like 85 so
he would have almost no memory of the
80s
so that's funny because everybody's all
about the 80s nostalgia now
the the nostalgia references because
they're in there
they're in there um and for someone like
me that had never seen the movies
you know they were never it wasn't never
like i
never felt lost like oh I don't know
what they're referencing so I don't get
this scene
yeah frequently they show little
flashbacks to the first movie
um like in the second season when johnny
goes off with the the other Cobra kai
that he grew up with and you see a
little flashback to all of them so it's
like okay I know who these characters
are
the scene isn't affecting me in any way
because they were like one-dimensional
villains in the first movie anyway so
it's not like oh this
lovely reunion of all these characters
well you didn't notice at the end of
that right
he ends up in a body bag oh you know
what I didn't even think about that
yeah okay
if that's another complaint I like i
like the character of johnny
the way he's written on the show
william's apk not the greatest actor
not a lot of range you can't recast that
part because he's the guy of course
but especially in like the first season
I feel like in the second season you
know they'd worked with it for a while
so they kind of knew how to write him
but
the first season you almost need someone
who's a little more cocky a little more
arrogant
he might not be like great in general
but I think he's great in this show
he works for the parts like I said in
the second season I think they write
more
with him in mind than they probably did
in the first season he's um
he's more likeable than danny but that's
kind of
by design yeah I think that's one of the
reasons I never
made a point of seeing the karate kid
movies I think I have like an unnatural
dislike of
uh ralph macchio yeah I don't know why
something about him I don't like him and
in the show he's kind of unlikable
isn't it funny we all have we all have
actors that we just just dislike on
principle
for for no good reason there's something
about it you i've just learned you hate
ralph macchio
yeah well that's one thing you'll get
out of uh
uh karate kid 3. daniel is so annoying
in that movie
he's awful in that movie the way he's
written and the performance and it's
funny because it's only supposed to take
place like
nine months after the first movie yeah
but it's like shot in like 1989
and he suddenly looks like a 30 year old
man
he's he's he's not likable in this well
they play that up though he's like a
sleazy used car
salesman and that's that's fun too that
kind of
shift in focus of the two the the bully
and the uh
the hero from the original karate kid
the role reversal
yeah because jenny lawrence was the Rich
kid in in the original
yeah and then we find out that all this
money came from his stepdad
who they then they they hate each other
there's another another father-son
relationship that has broken down
yeah and then now danny you know he has
a successful car
dealership and now he's he's the Rich
boy
and I I don't know I I think I think
after the show was a success i
I he he wanted to like a bigger part i
know it seems like he's all over season
two
he wasn't that prominent in season one
he was used just enough in season one
because the focus was on johnny
yeah and and uh miguel his relationship
with miguel
so yeah I mean maybe they just wanted to
expand the and like the world of the
show
but fifty percent of season two is
miyagido
yes and they're insufferable
biagido and his his fucking
zen bullshit i'll also be an obnoxious
used car salesman
yeah utterly grating I didn't find it
grating but it's definitely
one's his daughter and they're just like
they are not interesting at all
no there's her there's kind of the the
bad girl there's like a
little love triangle going on the snooty
girls I like ayusha
she's the the Cobra kai girl the oh yeah
the bigger one yeah yeah
yeah she's good they don't give her
enough to do no because they had to
focus on this boring love triangle
yeah the the teenage and obviously we're
not the target audience for that stuff
but I can see like
a younger person that maybe isn't even
familiar with the karate kid movies
that's the stuff that they're more
interested on this show so it's a good
balance
a little something for everybody without
shutting out old fans
don't you feel good knowing that for a
very long time we don't have to talk
about star wars
you say that it always it's it's
it's like it's like it's like michael
myers
star wars always gets back up when you
think it's dead and it's gonna keep
coming at ya
and it gets increasingly worse and more
convoluted yes okay
and that that's another thing going for
Cobra kai is like nobody was expecting a
karate kid revival nobody asked for it
and so it kind of has you know I mean
that's a theme of the original movie on
this show is the kind of the underdog
and the show kind of is that because
it's like nobody had any expectations
for this thing nobody really wanted it
it just sort of came into existence
and it's like oh it's pretty good it's
kind of a stealth franchise
it's had so many reboots and they've all
been so forgettable
yeah you don't you don't remember they
existed yeah the next karate kid came
and went
I basically forgotten about that one
yeah
yeah yeah yeah the will smith movie
nobody saw it
no people saw it I think it did okay did
it but it's one of those movies that
like it did pretty good
and then nobody talks about it a month
later yeah like the robocop
remake hey it wasn't as terrible as we
expected it to be
and then everybody just goes on with
their lives and never thinks of it again
but this is good yeah this is pretty
good the first season's really strong
the second season
not as strong but it has some very silly
karate fights that are fun
but one of those hashbrowns at the end
you know like hashbrown team Cobra kai
or something
and then send it to the internet
I know netflix just picked it up what
i'll say is I think it's only got one
season left
that's fair yeah that's good I think i
think they need to wrap it up
we got one season johnny and danny need
to become friends
finally they had two two really good
episodes
were they almost kind of became buddies
yeah well that's that's the thing too is
I like I like about the show is that
there are no
aside from crease there are no villains
yeah most of the show is just characters
miscommunicating which is nice
especially you know that's not the kind
of thing that's going to
appeal to people that live their lives
on twitter where anyone that they have a
slight disagreement with is
an evil monster but but that gray area
of yeah a lot of the
the drama stems from just
miscommunication
that's the big breakaway from this show
like the previous ones like this is
clearly
danny is clearly the hero johnny was
clearly the bully
yeah this show loves the gray area
it's like oh the 80s bully is the most
sympathetic character on the show now
a little redemption it's an interesting
change of pace
yes yes they're gonna they can only do
one more season because they're gonna
run out of things to mine from the
original movies
after watching the movies after seeing
the first the two seasons of it
it's like everything is referenced
there's the little uh
paddle thing that's in the second movie
they pull that out at one point
the date miguel goes on is the same
place that danny went on a date with um
elizabeth shu
yeah yeah that's at the end of the
second season they teased the return of
elizabeth shu
so once she's involved in season three
there'll be some sort of
love triangle drama once you get that
out of the way
there's really nothing else to do but
they could they could bring back the
the villain from credit kid 3. you think
this is the end of it all man
i'm gonna open Cobra kai dojos all over
this valley
from now on when people say karate
around here all they'll mean is kobra
kai you're right
john creases karate they should
bring that guy back i'm gonna check this
out now the egomaniacal
uh multi-millionaire that owns all these
big corporations but also owns
one little karate dojo if it's that
schlocky
i'll be very curious to see if they ever
do reference it they kind of do in this
season
at one point daniel mentions like i
briefly
okay I went to uh Cobra kai I briefly
became oh yeah yeah that's right they do
but but it's sort of uh retrofitting it
because he didn't know he was a part of
Cobra kai
he didn't know that the
multi-millionaire was was secretly
in cahoots with crease it's so stupid
it's amazingly stupid okay this is proof
you don't you don't need to love
the original movies to enjoy Cobra kai
no absolutely not I had never even seen
him
but like I said that that you know you
know everything about it and you
certainly know
the dynamic of the the bully and so to
see that
upended is is refreshing and fun yeah
now what do we do we get coronavirus dot
