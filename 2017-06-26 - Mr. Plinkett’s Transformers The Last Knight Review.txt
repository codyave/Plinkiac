"It’s finally here! Mr. Plinkett reviews the latest and most terrible Transformers movie of all!!!" (archive.is/zrtyz)

Transfivers Five: The Last Knight is the worst movie ever made.
Where do I begin to tell you how much of a confusing mess this loud, obnoxious, terrible movie is?
A movie that's made specifically for weird, confused Chinese people.
Well, I'm just not gonna bother.
I gotta go now, bye!
