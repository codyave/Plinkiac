Gentlemen, gentlemen. Relax. You must analyze the situation rationally. Wisdom is divine.
Okay, sir. currently, several egg-shaped vehicles are, are landing on our planet even as we speak. Now, it's my belief that they've come here to, uh, give us gifts and shower us with technology and lead us to a golden age of enlightenment.
Sir, I would be forced to disagree with his opinion. Both of their eggcrafts have guns. And they've already attacked three major cities and taken millions of hostages.
Uh, nobody's perfect.
Sir, as a representative of the families, I personally recruited several men to help us take care of the situation.
No, no, no. We're only going to use our Orange Forces on this one. No outside help.
Well, sir, I have personally went through the trouble to recruit two men of my own. Why, it's Hulk Hogan and David Hasselhoff!
Yeah, I pity the egg that messes with me!
Where's Jay Leno? Where's The Tonight Show?
No, no, no! Don't you all see what this is? Why, why this is a very attack at the very heart of the Oranges! They', they're going after our own homeworld now! Why, there's nothing else we can do but to stand up amongst ourselves, to send a message to stand for Orange unity! Why, why, I say when we are threatened, we must unite ourselves to take care of this problem. We, we don't need anyone outside of us. We are Oranges, we are strong!
Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with you. We should assemble a very large strike force and violently attack them.
Hear, hear! Now that's a plan if I've ever heard one.
Base One to Command, Base One to Command, General McCaggot here. Prepare all forces for a massive invasion. Have all units take their guns and shoot them in every direction in hopes of hitting something. We are about to be invaded.
Those eggs are coming, everyone. So let's get cracking!
Mighty fine day for a war, isn't it?
No day is good for a war. Unless it's Monday through Friday.
This is General McCaggot to all troops. Prepare to engage the enemy.
Commander Asmar?
Yes, sir?
Assemble your troops. It'ss time to attack.
Yes!
It is time. Begin your attack!
Aw, shit! An explosive shell!
Corgi, are you alright?
Ohh...I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Oh, man. Medic, medic!!
War is going pretty well, actually. We've only lost 50% of our...oh my lord, there's a child on the battlefield!
General, get that child off the battlefield. Fire all weapons on him.
Look, kid. We have to get off of this battlefield now. The most terrible thing--
I lost my mommy.
I don't care about your mommy right now. Let's go.
Which way's my mommy? She's gone.
Your mommy's probably dead in the bloody battle.
Oh, god.
Oh, my. I thought that grass looked awfully phony. I guess that means we're captured.
Oh, no. Where's my mommy?
What's going on here? I demand you let us out of this cage immediately. Who's in charge of this operation?
Be quiet!
I'm scared, Mr. Sunkyst. What are they going to do with us? We're all scared.
They're probably going to do terrible experiments on us. horrendous stuff. They're going to probably flay our skin, and leave us there to die or something. Horrible Nazi-like experiments, I'm sure. But that's okay. Be brave, we're all oranges here, and I'm sure we can make it through this if they don't kill us.
I'm scared, Mr. Sunkyst. My mommy wants me home soon.
Shut up, kid. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be in this mess.
I think we're d-ughhhh!
Give 'em hell, boys! Give 'em hell!
Okay, boys. You heard the sarge. Kill 'em real good!
Everybody, fire your guns!
It's on fire, auughhh!
N6N4, report to shell maintenance.
Yeah, so, uh, what's your name? Have you been working here long, baby?
You, there. Get back to work.
Oh, my god. I'm scared.
Professor Wimplesticks, I don't wanna be dipped into that stuff. I'm real frightened.
Bring in the next four prisoners.
Don't worry, now. I'm sure our strike force will get here any minute, and they'll blow apart this whole place. We'll be saved. Just wait and see.
