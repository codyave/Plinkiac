[Part I]
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace was the most disappointing thing since my son.
I mean, how much more could you possibly fuck up the entire backstory to Star Wars?! 
And while my son eventually hanged himself in the bathroom of a gas station, the unfortunate reality of the Star Wars prequels is that they’ll be around...forever.
They will never go away.
They can never be undone.
If someone who’s under the age of like 20 says his least favourite film in the series is The Empire Strikes Back because it was the most boringest one, then I suggest you shut this review off right now before I carefully explain how much of a fucking idiot you are.
So where do I possibly start?
Nothing in The Phantom Menace makes any sense at all.
It comes off like a script written by an 8-year old.
It’s like George Lucas finished the script in one draft, like turned it in, and they decided to go with it without anyone saying that it made no sense at all, or was a stupid, incoherent mess.
I guess at this point who’s gonna question George, or tell him what to do?
He controls every aspect of the movie.
He probably got rid of those people that questioned him creatively a long time ago.
I also think that everyone just assumed that a Star Wars prequel would be an instant hit, regardless of what the plot was.
Really… how hard could it be to screw up? It’s like screwing up mashed potatoes.
You boil the water, you pour in the packet.
Number 1: The Characters.
The biggest and most glaring problem with the Phantom Menace is the characters.
This is like the most obvious part of movie making, but I guess I gotta explain it when talking about this turd.
So let’s start at Movie Making 101, shall we?
You see, in most movies the audience needs a character to connect with.
Typically this character is something called a protagonist.
When you’re in a weird movie with, like, aliens, and monsters, and weirdos, the audience really needs someone who’s like a normal person like them to guide them through the story.
Now this of course doesn’t apply to EVERY movie, but it works best in the sci-fi, superhero, action, and fantasy genres.
I picked a few examples to illustrate this point: Marty McFly, John McClane, Billy Peltzer, Sarah Connor, Neo, Charlie Bucket, Peter Parker, Cliff Secord, Johnny Rico, Rocky Balboa, and Kevin Bacon.
So, in addition to being, like, an everyday kinda schlub, usually the protagonist is someone that’s down on their luck, in a bad place in their lives, or someone who everything just doesn’t always go perfectly for them.
Eventually they’ll be confronted with some kind of obstacle or struggle that they gotta deal with.
If we like them, we hope they succeed.
The drama in the film is the result of us rooting for them against opposition.
Eventually our prumurmrurm will find themselves in the lowest point where it seems like all is lost, but eventually they’ll pull through and conquer whatever force opposes them.
It’s satisfying when our hero gets ahead from where they started off at.
They make like a change.
This is called an arc.
Often too, they’ll get the girl in the end as icing on the cake.
Now I need to explain that I don’t think that all movies should be the same, or conform to the same kind of structure, but it works well in certain kinda movies.
So unless you’re the Coen Brothers, David Lynch, Paul Thomas Anderson, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, Lars Von Trier, David Cronenberg, Gus Van Sant, Quentin Tarantino, John Waters, Wes Anderson, Sam Peckinpah, Terry Gilliam, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, or Jim Jarmusch, you really shouldn’t stray away too far from this kind of formula.
Especially if you’re making a movie that’s aimed at children, and has a cartoon rabbit in it that steps in the poopy.
This is all of course completely applicable to the original Star Wars film, and the character of Luke Skywalker.
This was accomplished even without all the wonders of modern CGI.
Now with all you’ve just learned, in this video that I have made for educational purposes, I want you to tell me who the main character of The Phantom Menace was.
I can tell you it’s not the Jedi.
They were just on some kind of boring mission that they didn’t really care about.
Plus they were fucking boring themselves.
It wasn’t Queen Amidala, cuz she was some foreign Queen who the movie was certainly not really about specifically either.
You might be thinking that it’s Anakin, cuz he was like a slave and saved the day at the end by accidentally blowing up the starship, but the audience doesn’t meet Anakin until 45 minutes into the movie.
And then the things that are happening around him are pretty much out of his control or understanding.If a protagonist has no concept of what’s goin on or what’s at stake, then there’s no real tension or drama… without that there’s no story.
So the conclusion is that there isn’t one.
Before the movie opened I was really excited to hear that Scottish actor Ewan McDonald was going to be playing Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought that was a great choice, and he’d be perfect as the lead of this movie.
But he wasn’t really… He just sat on the ship and complained a lot.
The Queen’s wardrobe, maybe, but not enough for you to barter with.
Not in the amount you’re talking about.
So YOU may like the characters, y’know, if you’re stupid.
So let’s ask some REAL people about the Star Wars characters, and see what THEY say.
I posed this simple challenge to them:
Describe the following Star Wars character WITHOUT saying what they look like, what kind of costume they wore, or what their profession or role in the movie was.
Describe this character to your friends like they ain’t never seen Star Wars.
The more descriptive they could get, the stronger the character, right?
Han Solo.
He is a rogue.
He is...
He is very arrogant, but charming.
Roguish if you will.
Han Solo is totally dashing.
Wannabe-dashing.
He fancies himself a playboy.
So, like, he’s a smarmy, cocksure, uh...womanizer?
Scoundrel.
He is, uh, he is pigheaded.
Completely sexy in, like, a bad boy sorta way where, like, he’s gonna ride the line.
He’s got a bit of a dark streak to him with, um, you know, shooting Greedo in the bar.
But also, deep down, he has a heart of, a thief with a heart of gold.
That’s his character, really.
Qui-Gon Jinn.
He is...stoic?
I don’t remember that character.
He’s Liam Neeson, with the beard.
Oh, yes.
Well, he has a beard.
Qui-Gon Jinn...and, uh, he was...
Let’s see here, um...stern?
C-3PO.
His character is the, uh, is kind of the bumbling sidekick.
Afraid...a scaredy cat...he’s timid.
C-3PO is...anal retentive.
He’s prissy.
Um, well, C-3PO is-is prissy...he’s used a lot as comic relief.
He is the comic relief.
High-strung.
He’s bumbling...effeminate.
Queen Amidalan.
That is going to be fucking impossible because she doesn’t have a character.
She is, um...she’s Natalie Portman.
Uh, yeah, like, uh, like just kind of...
Um, well, I can’t say she’s a queen...I was gonna say she’s a Queen.
Normal, I guess...ust kinda normal.
Makeup would be a description...I was gonna describe the makeup.
Eh, describe Queen Amidala’s character...um, monotone?
She is the...
She looks a lot like Keira Knightley.
I can’t answer that and you know it.
So...
Uh, she is...this is funny, by the way...I get it.

[Part II]
Number 2: The Story.
The second biggest problem with The Phantom Menace is the whole story and the way it was told.
It's almost mind boggling how complex the awfulness is.
From the very start of this movie I could tell something was really wrong.
Just by the way it started.
It opens with some boring pilot asking for permission to land on a ship that looks like a half-eaten doughnut with the doughnut hole in the middle.
What the fuck is that?! Then two cloaked figures walk into a room in a completely flat angle.
They sit down in a conference room, drink tea, and wait to talk about a trade dispute with something that looks like my ex-wife.
While they eventually do get to the ball-numbing, mindless action that the fan boys crave, I found myself utterly bored already.
Compare this fecal matter to the opening of the original Star Wars.
You see, a guy named William Shakesman once said, Brevity is the soul of wit.
This just means don't waste my time.
You keep it nice and simple.
I said stop wasting my time.
Stop it.
Without saying one word of awkward, boring, political dialogue that goes on for ten minutes, we know everything we need to know just by the visuals.
Rebels.
Empire.
We get a sense of how small and ill-equipped the rebels are, and how large and powerful the Empire is.
The low angle implies dominance, and the length of the Star Destroyer implies the long reach of the Empire.
This shot says everything we need to know without saying ONE WORD! In fact, this is so genius, I have a feeling that George Lucas had nothing to do with it, and probably fought against putting it in the movie.
So this comparison of openings is a small example of the overall styles of both films.
The original trilogy was a modern day homage to the classic adventure serials of the past.
The kind I used to watch when I was in my 40's. Good vs. Evil, the classic hero on a journey, the adventurous rogue, a damsel in distress, the wise old sage, gay robots, and an epic quest of discovery.
The new movies are about shoving as much crap into each shot as possible.
This is part of the reason why I find the Special Edition so fucking offensive.
Cuz you're into what's happening in the movie, and they keep shoving more shit on the screen to distract you.
It reminds me of a child waving his arms in the background for attention.
Doesn't Lucas realize that cluttering the frame up with shit is NOT what makes Star Wars good?
Fuck you, Rick Berman.
You ruined this, too?
Stop ruining...wait a minute...that ain't Rick Berman.
What is it with Ricks?
So the film is called The Phantom Menace, and by the nature of the story there is no clear villain.
Hey idiot!
You're not making The Usual Suspects here.
You're making a movie for children right?
How ‘bout a bad guy in the movie who's motivation is clear?
The prequels should be very similar in style to the originals, cuz I don't like things that are different.
Number 3: Death and Space Taxes
So when you find yourself thinking things like "Huh?" or "What?", when you're watching how illogical characters act in a movie, it's not really a good sign.
Now I've analyzed this film with a team of cheerleaders, and they came up with one unanymous conclusion.
That if I let them go, they promise they won't tell nobody.
Anyways, so at the end of the movie Yoda makes Obi-Wan a Jedi Knight.
Even though in the opening titles it says he's a Jedi Knight.
So we'll just call em Jedi Knights too.
People call me a murderer even though I ain't never been caught yet.
So the Jedi's are there to do WHAT exactly?
According to the opening title crawl it was to settle a dispute over the taxation of trade routes.
Ohh...
So what makes the Jedi Knights experts in Intergalactic Trade Laws?
So the Trade Federation have set up a blockade around Naboo in order to stop them from getting space supplies, which instantly causes some kind of crisis that we never see.
Okay.
I don't get it.
Why would an organization called The Trade Federation wanna blockade trade?
Usually a blockade is to stop something you DON'T want to get in.
You see we once set up a naval blockade around Cuba to stop the Russians from setting up missile launchers there.
It was a little event you might a heard of.
It wasn't a big deal, y'know, but you might've heard of it.
It was called World War I.
Geez, you stupid people gotta learn your history right.
So if the Trade Federation were like merchants moving goods and services around the Galaxy, then why did they seem more like a military with armies of robots?
However, if they were like a bureaucracy that was in charge of overseeing and regulating trade routes, you'd think they'd be happy about the whole new space taxes.
Unless all the taxes went straight to like Space Obama, and they didn't see any of it?
The point is I'm still not sure what the doughnut ships were there to do.
And don't any of you fucks tell me that it was explained more in the novelization of some Star Wars book.
What matters is the movie.
I ain't never read one of them Star Wars books, or any books in general for that matter, and I ain't about to start.
Don't talk about them stupid video games, or, or novels, comic books or any of that fucking crap.
I see enough of that shit.
I got Phantom Menace toys scattered all over in my basement.
You see my grandkids play with them down there when they come over to visit, and they leave that shit all over the place.
Let me see if I can find some of them so I can show you.
I'm gonna go down in my basement now.
Hold on, I gotta switch the cameras.
Okay, here we are in my basement.
So my grandkids, they come over and they play and they leave their stupid Star Wars shit around.
The Qui-Gon sucker.
They didn't even eat the sucker! What's this shit, Anakin summin...what else did they leave around muh basement?
What's this?
What is this?
Some kinda Darth Maul toy?
These kids, always leaving this crap around.
What's this?
They left shit in my bin?
My plastic bin.
What is this?
A little Darth Maul?
Stupid Darth Maul.
What do they got here?
They didn't even open this.
Naboo...Naboo necessary set.
Mister?
Mister.
Quiet.
Please let me go!
I promise I won't say anything!
I'll do anything, just let me go!
Quiet! I'm making my Youtube Star Wars review!
Star Wars?
Don't hurt me!
Mister, please just let me--
I said quiet!
I'm making my review, so just shut your fucking mou--
Anyways.
So, I realize that Senator Palpatine was using the Trade Federation to create a crisis to advance himself politically.
Like, that was the plot, I think?
But the conflict from the blockade and the subsequent invasion is the entire movie.
Understanding what role the Trade Federation played in this is important.
You know, what the blockade was about, who was getting taxed, what kinda supplies were so crucial to the Naboo?
What was it, like medical supplies?
Was there some kinda plague?
Did they not have the capacity to survive on such a lush planet with a huge power reactor for ONE day without space trade?
You see I would have accepted the idea of some kinda mystery villain if the basics were at least clear.
So when two guys wearing robes come on board their ship, Rosie the Robot just assumes they are Jedi Knights and tells the Chaternarians.
Even though almost every single character wears robes in Star Wars.
Then somehow this robot knows or thinks they are Jedi Knights.
Hey idiots, so much for the disguise! Even a protocol droid could sniff you out.
Maybe it's not a disguise, but whatever.
So the Chaternarians immediately inform this mystery guy that they're running this scam with – a guy who looks like Satan – that Jedi's are on the ship, and of course - so that we can have an action scene – he tells them to kill the Jedi.
You see, they never once went into the room to say hello to the Jedi, and that they'll be right with them, but they tell Palpatine that they are Jedis.
And then they try to gas them to death based solely on the hunch of a droid.
Who's fucking with my medicine?
Who wants pizza roll?
E-mail me if you want a pizza roll.
Post a comment on this web zone if you want a pizza roll.
Gotta send 'em in the mail.
Who's fucking with my medicine?
