https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979435/

Mike: Hello, and welcome to the commentary track for The Recovered. I'm Mike Stoklasa.
Jay: And I'm Jay Bauman. This is the 2013 commentary. We shot this movie in the fall of 2007, then did some reshoots in the fall of 2007, and then we limped to a distribution release in 2008.
Mike: That's right, Jay. So many people saw this film while it was in distribution.
