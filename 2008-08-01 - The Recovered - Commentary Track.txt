The Recovered - Commentary Track
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979435/

Mike: Hello, and welcome to the commentary track for The Recovered. I'm Mike Stoklasa.
Jay: And I'm Jay Bauman. This is the 2013 commentary. We shot this movie in the fall of 2006, and then did some reshoots in the fall of 2007, and then limped to a distribution release in 2008.
Mike: That's right, Jay. So many people saw this film while it was in distribution.
Jay: We should say, this movie was made in sort of an interesting time. It was kind of the first project that was what RedLetterMedia now is, where it's sort of us collaborating kind of 50/50 on a project. The only thing this movie is lacking is Rich Evans. In more ways than one, this movie is lacking Rich Evans.
Mike: There's no Rich Evans in this movie.
Jay: No, but the backstory was, you had just moved back from Arizona, right?
Mike: Yes.
Jay: Which is where RedLetterMedia was formed.
Mike: Correct. Yeah, I formed RedLetterMedia during the two or three years I lived in Arizona. I did some music videos, concert videos, and stuff like that, so I had to come up with a production company to release those under. So I made RedLetterMedia Inc in there and stuff, then moved back here.
Jay: Legally, we can't say why you moved back.
