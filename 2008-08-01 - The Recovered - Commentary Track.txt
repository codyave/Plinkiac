The Recovered - Commentary Track
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979435/

Mike: Hello, and welcome to the commentary track for The Recovered. I'm Mike Stoklasa.
Jay: And I'm Jay Bauman. This is the 2013 commentary. We shot this movie in the fall of 2006, and then did some reshoots in the fall of 2007, and then limped to a distribution release in 2008.
Mike: That's right, Jay. So many people saw this film while it was in distribution.
Jay: We should say, this movie was made in sort of an interesting time. It was kind of the first project that was what RedLetterMedia now is, where it's sort of us collaborating kind of 50/50 on a project. The only thing this movie is lacking is Rich Evans. In more ways than one, this movie is lacking Rich Evans.
Mike: There's no Rich Evans in this movie.
Jay: No, but the backstory was, you had just moved back from Arizona, right?
Mike: Yes.
Jay: Which is where RedLetterMedia was formed.
Mike: Correct. Yeah, I formed RedLetterMedia during the two or three years I lived in Arizona. I did some music videos and concert videos, and stuff like that, so I had to come up with a production company to release those under. So I made RedLetterMedia Inc there and stuff, then moved back here.
Jay: Legally, we can't say why you had to move back.
Mike: Yeah, yeah. Let's just say I have warrants out for my arrest.
Jay: Don't tell anybody.
Mike: No, that's just a joke. Anyways, yeah. We decided to shoot a film, and Jay and I have always done comedy videos, and schlock, and Rich Evans falling down the stairs, and fighting a small doll. And Jay always did, you know, women getting punched in their pregnant bellies. People vomiting on themselves. So we said, hey, let's make a more of a, give it a shot to make a more of a commercial film, something horror-related. So we brainstormed a bunch of different horror ideas we've always wanted to do. That's kind of what we came up with here. How did that happen? How did we come up with this idea?
Jay: Well, it was, we were sort of, I think, trying to test the waters of distribution, and see how that worked. Because the movie you had done before this had gotten some distribution. You had a DVD distribution deal. 
Mike: Yeah.
Jay: So we were kind of saying, okay, well, let's...low-budget horror movies. I guess we should say, this isn't a passion project movie, this movie. Like, we tried to make it as good and personal as we could, but it was sort of an attempt to make something that we could sell. I kind of equate it to shooting weddings. Because when we started doing video production with our video production company, we shot a lot of weddings.
