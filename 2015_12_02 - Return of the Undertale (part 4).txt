could do it that way what that way that
way
no college no college for 10 I'm a gauge
you have to grind even more - by the
hour not worth it not worth it for us
Jack you are not pointing in the right
directions well not to you but to rich I
am it looks like I'm not pointing the
right directions to you but - rich I'm
pointing the right directions settle
down
dude well well anyway it's fine this way
whatever there's an accident it's all
fine everything's fine everything's fine
they got that way now you're a now
you're in them they in a benefit what
happens if you feed Timmy tenth legs was
there a special thing that happens
I don't know how close are we to
finishing this sucker tonight by the way
someone is asking how close we are
I'm gonna guess not very
when are we gonna play some minecraft
get out of town
we're probably halfway you're almost
halfway throughout and then no we will
not be finishing this tonight would you
do stupid I did stupid yeah well there
you go fucking sweat
dude dude dude dude
what you're right I had Donuts I really
need to think about the audience while
I'm pointing out stuff too rich I'm
confusing the audience and that makes me
a very unprofessional streamer I'm very
sorry you set OBS to record your streams
as you stream why don't I get an HDD for
doing it myself but not sure what size
will be okay for four hours of footage
we actually don't record ourselves we we
just that which saves the streams which
saves the streams and then you can
either download the stream directly from
twitch or send the stream over to
YouTube and download directly from
YouTube but you can or go to a night dev
night dev has a bunch of great twitch
resources they have a downloader where
you can download past twitch broadcasts
it's not the greatest quality um
but its fate works for us I think I
think record oh no I think we're
recording the footage and streaming
would be tasking for the computer so so
we don't I you and I use a separate
program for just recording gameplay
footage if we're like playing something
for the show I use the the software that
game capture software that came with my
held gato that seems to work very nice
had a gato not to hell gato an elgato
even though
like I said helicopter the hell or
guitar or
yeah but if you're looking for footage I
grew up mr. glitch like huge hard drives
external hard drives are pretty
reasonably priced nowadays so just go
for a big one it'll be fine
I am Adam I saw that's true
tired of losing a ton of quality with
twitch downloader yeah the you know it's
compressed it's usually 720 and it's it
is what it is what it is the the quality
ain't good but uh so look into it look
into also recording you might need to
what might help if you're looking to
record and stream at the same time is
taking taking use of buffering that
might help but then you need to adjust
your microphone settings to make sure
you're synched up but
Jack have you ever looked at your
microphone and thought it looked like a
robot dick no do you think it looks like
a robot dick I mean one robots don't
need dicks right except fuck Bob though
he doesn't have one fuck but does not
have a dick
he has no dingle or dongle does he fuck
it's kind of the power it's kind of the
power fuck but we have not only have we
considered playing board games on prereq
we have actually played board games on
prereq before and I do want to play more
of them behind you
with the power of seven human souls RK
King asked or dream or will become a god
that power has gore can finally
shattered a barrier
he will finally take the surface back
from their humanity give them back the
suffering under stand
this is your only chance at red am sure
I'm good at picking endurance voices out
Jaguar
it'll be fine no I don't think it'll say
much give up yours
the only thing I'm worried about is
choosing an appropriate voice for how a
character looks and acts that's
commendable this is a creepy spooky
Specter night kind of thing right well

does have a bunch of each other alright
hey chat it is okay now tell us what's
going on
tell us what is going on
we are now asking you
to tell us what is happening with this
fight because obviously we just don't
know
run like hell when your heart is red you
can flee the fight
flea when you are ready that's what
they're saying they're saying you have
to run away from the fight you're right
okay can you actually beat her right
they thing you can kill her
or you can you can but it's very very
hard I think you did pretty well you got
it looks like you got pretty far
well no we don't want to know if we can
kill her we want to know if like there's
a way of beating her without running
away you know like getting her through
the corrected dialogue by doing all
these insane challenges that rich is
doing like is there a way to to beat her
that way not kill her beat her it
doesn't help the world barely out of
healing matters
yeah we've never bought any in shops
really so we should work on that once
work okay no there's no way to talk your
way out of this battle it's what they're
saying okay okay
okay I'm with it okay so now go to mercy
wait yeah what and you have to do it
again
maybe they say you have to do is like
three times
run away through them
and they say I go through the cave
yeah okay all right we got it Thank You
Chet thank you
is there any reason to switch between
pleading and challenging challenging
only seems to make her attacks faster
not good
bad news and shoes I've never seen in
k-pax I cannot answer that question
run away straight up Thanks keep running
nice rich figure out that sneaky yellow
arrow bullshit
I think I like I think something like
this is there's a tough balance between
figuring it out in game and also like
engaging with the community it's
something we dabbled on a little bit
during our during our blood-borne review
which is like this is all part of it is
like talking with your friends about a
game going down the line message boards
and forums and like just using the
community to help figure out the problem
we're not going to do it we're done
looks
looks like your dad
yellow arrows might be too much for me
oh my god I can't believe you did that
that's okay rich we can call it yeah
we're gonna call it
these cannot end now only it is it's
totally ending right now yes only ending
now
I think this game is incredibly cute
it has a ton of personality right you
know
well I'm gonna Jack packs up and goes
and I'm gonna I'm gonna play some
blood-borne I'm gonna be back so the
stream is only temporarily it's going on
like a brief break yeah but I'm gonna be
back I'm gonna set a blood-borne fuck
I'm probably gonna watch a movie right
all right
