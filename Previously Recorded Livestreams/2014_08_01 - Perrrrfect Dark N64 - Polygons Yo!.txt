not too late no I suppose I could be in
Fiske up at some point but that's okay
all I know is that if I was in space cop
my character name would be Phil oh my
god
Oh what what's wrong you what are the
control spoon room the fuck is happening
what is going on oh it's just I'm
playing for the first time is somebody
frosted here what is it doing that's
making you go you we have to describe
these things as a fucking gaming stream
I'm sorry um so just moving Oh God
moving feels weird and I moved and it
felt really weird it felt weird enough
where I said you like what's weird about
it is four words really backwards or
something or no no I you know I forgot
that I was playing the n64 for a second
and I pressed forward hoping that I
would look down and now and I moved
forward I have no idea where Oh there's
probably probably supposed to go to that
yellow dot oh the hooses kid Megadeth
yes yeah the question is Megadeth that's
my whole question in my response is
Megadeth yes yeah that's a good response
seriously though rust in peace is a
fantastic album it's great when you can
when you connect somebody that's got a
lot of ambitions and some songwriting
experience with a couple of really
awesome jazz players I'm sure anyone is
in the metal is read about this whole
thing with Hardy Freeman being like went
to Japan and is teaching all sorts of
guitar and English and things and all
this blah blah blah um
but those guys Bri fucking fantastic
that record is a stellar sort of
benchmark in crash metal alright yeah
there you go same question Merc yes yes
the answer is that question is yes sure
Bane is a character that does exist I
have no tattoos in multiple mediums
no tattoos no Matt one oh man you're not
hardcore at all if I have one planned I
just have to get it I have no idea what
I'm doing in this game there's a yellow
dot so I'm sure I'm supposed to go to
that yellow dot Oso has asked how I feel
about anthrax anthrax are probably my
favorite of the big four thrash bands
what are the big four thrash bands they
are anthrax Megadeth Metallica and
Slayer okay and anthrax were the most
consistent high level of excellent and I
assure you to like me
them above anthrax oh okay I get them
Elvis delvis I fucking love The Melvins
I don't think they're great spanned ever
because they can be very hit or miss and
they put out way too many records um but
I do love them very much ah mutation I
think Mastodon are
and not my thing so I don't know if I've
heard Mastodon never I've heard of them
I don't know I cannot for the life of me
think of a mastodon song well see that's
not a good time yeah what's the story
here jack do we win this game
yeah oh I have no fucking idea they
haven't told you no this is the first
thing that I'm doing and I don't know
shit I know I don't know shit up top I
dunno it's auto-aim Oh which is mom you
need that for this stupid controller
okay that thing oh yeah well guns that's
cool

is what I got so fred durst extreme of
color duty right now into his own
channel is he really not like is that
what fred durst does not yes good for
him I guess
gay aliens
yes gay aliens okay yeah you know you
missed your opportunity there you should
have said gaily oh yeah yeah but you
know you drop the ball and I had to pick
it up so Oh Sassie rich I don't have any
particular thoughts on your client Brock
Lesnar but I really do wish you recall
because we'd have a nice discussion
about about wrestling that I can't even
think of right now he's gonna come home
and I'm getting way too way too far into
this on a hanger for the wrestling I I
stopped watching wrestling in the early
nineties I started again recently it's
gotten very interesting again uh you
know y'all for me though the wrestling
history for me mmm I was a kid I loved
the door Hulk Hogan sure and you know
Bobby Heenan Roddy Piper oh I I hated
those men with a passion sure with a
horrible passion recently recently I was
watching some old wrestling videos and I
yeah yeah it's so funny the way that
works yeah I I wasn't in when I was a
kid I wasn't really into it apart from
you know every once in a while thinking
it would be like a Saturday night's main
event or something like that I would see
it but I didn't get real heavy into it
again until post-college
same time was playing Bolton I got way
into wrestling because it was there was
a different sort of surge in it then
dropped off for a while and recently
have kind of gotten into it again just
because I know there are some friends
that I haven't hear that to work at bars
and they get you know that everybody
gets together at the bar and they put on
the pay-per-view and then everybody gets
together and has a good time and I got
kind of back into who's cool and you
know seeing guys like CM Punk that are
just really good wrestlers that worked
really hard to get where they are and
Daniel Bryan and people like that that's
just way more interesting than write it
out you know actors that yeah throw each
other around hmm I don't think there's a
single player mission in this you
serious
what are you doing unless I am messed up
somehow you know what here's what we do
Charlie I'm hitting the reset button all
right hi I remember I was a kid down
there's a WWF like show your wife gosh
our area yep and my parents like we see
it sit near the aisle Hulk Hogan ran by
and I reached my arm out and touched all
Colgan as I ran by and he was sweating
this fog oh yeah yes I just I think I
didn't just like turn around I just like
wipe my hand off

understand how short of that I
understand how he died young because
I'll guess what he had substance issues
and you know he was a wrestler and
wrestlers don't seem to live very long
um but uh I think I would like to say
that there are some promos that he cut
that you have just not seen that are
fantastic I'm prong I doubt it I know I
doubt it but there's there's a level of
insanity there that's just wait what was

trying to market to nerds and doing a
really bad job they're not trying to
market to nerds they're trying to market
to grandmas who have nerd grandchildren
now they're trying to market to nerds
are they've been doing a bad job
that shows been on the air for a while
they're leaving a bad job marketing to
nerds

there's a good point two and a Half Men
was on the air for a while - yeah that
was the most popular show on TV for the
most watched show and it was terrible
sure but the question is I've been doing
a bad job their job is to get people to
watch things if lots of people are
watching things know what I'm saying
even if it's low quality I don't think
you can say they're doing a bad job
they're doing a bad job of marketing to
nerds
maybe that I'm trying to market the
nerves yeah just one they just want
dollars I don't think they really care
where they're getting them from I don't
know that's that's been my argument okay
I don't want to watch the fucking show

center for that sorry sorry uh
sassy rich wants me to talk about Twin
Peaks Twin Peaks was a television show
that was on for a number of years two of
them that is a number it had a lot of
actors and there was a mystery who
killed Laura Palmer and they solved the
mystery and then the show continued wait
we need J mama didn't just talk about
that this they just want me to talk
about Twin Peaks and I won't be talking
about the new stuff haha bye Jay Jay
made some promises oh okay he's he's not
here no he's simply not here no I built
a J it will be here later I believe but
I will talk about it at that time I'll
probably be busy later I don't know if
they're doing that tonight
oh it's getting late I can't believe it
I heard a wider so light I don't know
why she's in a way to either maybe maybe
there was a car accident
Oh maybe red letter media is dead right
now
that's possibility I mean there's stuff
to play perfect card no property you
don't know that it's true you know what
I'm willing to bet on that well that's
that's fine Twin Peaks was on ABC um I
want to say it was in the eight o'clock
time from time slots in central zone um
they also though the David Lynch mark
frost also has a show called on the air
that was on ABC that I really enjoyed
quite a bit it was a sitcom about a 50s
television show a variety comedy program
that all everything always went wrong
all the time
okay it was what was that on the air
it's called they only made six episodes
that's why I haven't heard uh only two
of them aired three in some markets uh
it was not very well accepted oh are you
on drugs the error was toxic
I need a spycam okay all right um yeah
it was it was not very uh the network
didn't find it very interesting because
it was way too fucking wacky to be on TV
yep I think the last episode is I can't
even believe they thought that was going
to get on television it's it's
completely surreal and I loved it I
loved it it's like watching it's like
watching that last season of Space Ghost
Coast to Coast except that was on TV are
you are you familiar with I think it's
called alternative three there was some
kind of British science show I forgot
what it was okay but their last episode
was like normally a science show but
they made up a bunch of shit about Mars
and a conspiracy theory to put a colony
on Mars because the earth was slowly
dying Wow
yes Wow yes and there are people to this
day I guess that believe this I need to
see that it's you can find it on YouTube
okay okay that's great that's right on
my ah yep just a plain old regular so a
bunch of shit they like fake some kind
of like Mars landing footage oh that's
awesome that's awesome okay
apparently yes okay noted it alternative
three was the plan to colonize Mars
because the environment on earth was
gonna be coming in hospitable for life
nice yes
oh man okay whoa look at that picked up
night minun boom then that there you go
uh uh boom you did it
I won I won perfect arc because they
can't be from terrified nitrogen uh
right yeah when I won I want it perfect
there see Harry fed is there a place on
TV for a show like liquid television not
an mtv anymore um probably not even on
Cartoon Network anymore they've gotten
so specific with the shows which is a
bummer because I remember a lot of
really good short subject stuff on there
I mean that's where Bugis Butthead
started on flux jaywalks
looks the max boy and what's on the well
the next was separate next wasn't liquid
television no that was that was at the
same time but it was not on the Patrol I
got a certain caliber oh yeah yeah yes
it did um climate is Keith I want to say
ah is all right I think
Oh cookie cookie yagya milk on the max
was fucking fantastic anyway and liquid
television was really cool but I don't
think there's no place like that on I
mean that's what YouTube does these days
i I don't know what J and Mike's
thoughts aren't guardians of the galaxy
I we've seen it we've all seen it but I
have not talked to them about it
we don't hi Gretchen I don't want our
beautiful and perfect opinions to taint
J in Mike's obviously biased opinions
because they love everything about
marble the marble thing they're Marvel
fanboys oh boy which is why they kind of
seem to have liked and hated Marvel
movies and equal measure Oh another
friend is back Oh little friends are so
helpful
Becky looks gonna get old quick now
let's meet the first time yeah the
second time I look on doing well the
first time I figured it out for the
second time uh he's just there yeah this
looks like another important place
though yeah I think um I I believe I am
progressing in the game yeah ah hello
you should learn how to Amy Oh what what
are my thoughts without without getting
specifics on can I set this earlier you
might not have been her I think
guardians of the galaxy is flawed really
but it is a fun movie so there's that I
won't get too specific because there you
know there may be something I'm sure red
letter media and officially get specific
at some point yes so we can talk more in
depth at a later time and you should go
see a movie because it's always more fun
to be in
all right now somebody brought up
Mystery Science Theater and we can talk
about that because all my fucking god
alright um most most y'all I think you
you said you don't you didn't watch mr.
Eason hi I've seen like be like a few
out the three episodes total alright I
have nothing against which is my
official opinion on the show channel I
have nothing against the show but if I'm
gonna watch bad movies it's always
something I do with my kijang I don't
need their commentary I like to get
together with my friends and provide my
home but you're nothing against shows
fine fine show I've only seen three
episode okay Jack did you watch it no I
didn't have cable girl okay
so I I have seen one or two episodes and
it you know what always bothered me
about it hmm is the people talking Jack
you sound like my dad I know and it's
like because they would always make
funny jokes but then I would miss the
next part of the movie because of their
joke if that makes any sense I it's a
fine show the one or two episodes I've
seen or it's fine it's fine
alright now I have seen I believe with
maybe an exception of the first seasons
of the stuff in the first season I've
seen every episode okay I love that show
I love that show I watch it all the time
my family used to meet up at conventions
from three different places when they
wouldn't used to do the conventions
which was not very often but it's a big
show in my life and honestly like I
don't know if I'd be in Milwaukee
without that show because I met the
drummer in my bands when I had a dr.
Forrester shirt on and he's like where'd
you get that and they got at the
convention that we were talk to my
friends it was a thing that said it
really doesn't have a lot to do with our
show we're not sitting here and writing
jokes about they they make fun of movies
they write jokes about the movies they
we react the movies yeah and then kind
of dissect them late oh yeah we're
trying to watch it from more of a
filmmaking perspective I mean like you
know message we don't sit here and try
to think of jokes yeah you know that's
not that's not what we do and so it it's
is a different thing
I think that it doesn't hurt us I mean
with that I was more conscious during
space mutiny because I'd seen I had seen
in that episode fairly recently so it's
like I'm not going to make the jokes
that they made because I know those
jokes when you guys were kind of getting
close to it I didn't want to say
anything because you don't know shit and
I didn't see that episode so it's not
you know it's not something that I feel
like I need to make a point about
because you're enjoying it just fine um
I was not making those jokes I mean I
pointed out when the girl was right back
on the deck after she died because
that's not making a joke that's pointing
out how atrocious the editing isn't that
movie you made so you made an
observation yeah right yeah and it
happens to be the same observation that
other people on a different show made
because guess what they also watch the
movie and shit like that is impossible
to ignore right yeah which is why when
things like that happen like during that
whole dance scene you know entity in the
Clube people were saying the same things
because they watch that movie too and
it's you're going to get the same thing
out of it because it's fucking
ridiculous but but Josh I mean isn't it
isn't it proper etiquette to make a note
of every other show that has happened to
watch the same movie isn't that I mean
isn't that what other shows do they
always mention every single other critic
or show that has watched the same movie
right
yeah but we're bucking that trend Jack
we're saying no because I know when I
see like a review of a movie the the
next two pages of that review is noting
every single other person who's reviewed
that movie remember yeah Roger Ebert
always used to wait for Pauline Kael me
for her review to God not to be like and
then he'd spend like a good paragraph
just talking about what oh this was the
Pauline Kael review said this that
always happened in every reveal we ever
wrote until she died absolutely you know
I almost want to avoid
just it's too much I know but I don't
think I think if you guys run across
something don't look and then find out
what's an MSD movie I just won't say
anything
sure sure we'll just but then we're
gonna do the episode in the comments are
gonna be enough my chemistry ki mr. TT
day and I mean you see it was Adams to
get out can you not mention that how
dare you not mention that that's you
know that's how it is that's my biggest
question is why why would I mention it I
haven't even seen the episode even even
if you had seen the episode like I and I
hadn't seen the episode but I knew that
mst3k did Santa Claus huh why would we
mention that look I don't know this is
my one question no I don't know I don't
know what what would make someone and I
have also seen a lot of Mystery Science
Theater comics what would make someone
think that we would mention yeah and so
what if we if we mentioned it what what
happened that's my campaign holy crap
weird um what would that change if we
mentioned it right and a lot of it 95%
of it was why didn't you mention it and
5% of it was what did you think you
could bring to it the same thing we
bring to every fuckin movie same thing
we do every night pinky try to watch
this movie
yeah no I'm totally with it it's it's
it's the dumbest and we receive a lot of
dumb comments and bringing up Mystery
Science Theater might be one of the
dumbest dad yep but I just I really
wanna make it clear that we're not doing
Mystery Science Theater and it doesn't
it shouldn't have anything to do with it
that's not what we're doing that's not
what we're trying to do wait we're not
no no you were trying to do our own show
yeah I didn't sign up for that well
that's okay Jack because now you have
this you have perfect art now I have
perfect did you did you remember to
write all your drugs for perfect dark
you remember how you wrote that whole
skit where you forgot to put the
pakkun I did I think it Anna by the way
I think it worked out really well I went
okay there's a few comments you're
saying Prezi Prezi maybe this by that
that thing you were looking at it
earlier I don't know but oh how much the
saying uh-oh singing pictures Oh
spycam yeah thank you
that fucking thank you that I that was
pissing me off I had this camera and as
I believe I supposed to - I wouldn't
leave just record everything had a
cheap-ass spy camera of the future is
this right no no that you yeah that's me
oh you're controlling it externally okay
okay Carolee no not but pumps in the
homes the palms in the homes
I like a girl with the bomb - no home
one ah
MC Hammer ever oh yeah I've heard of MC
Hammer I'll do I believe by that point
Jackie was just going by hammer oh don't
hurt him where's the camera I don't know
I don't care and I don't know what's how
we doing
uh it's been a while okay I'm gonna
complete this objective and then we're
gonna play another game okay cuz yeah it
just keeps happening
oh no this way know what I think I came
from this way okay it's a question that
it's it's what was asked a while ago but
well I'm remembering it now open X come
I would like to play over all right I
just heard about open XCOM the other day
I mean I know they're working on a while
I don't know it was done and watch the
trailer it it adds some functionality
and it's like an update to the classic
XCOM game I'd like to play that at some
point I didn't know was done till
yesterday though so so like bye bye bye
update the classic X kind of you mean
this is not I don't know if it's
technically a source port but no it's
not enemy I know this this is a
something for the ninety version 90s
version oh cool
user interface updates and the like okay
oh yeah I love this champ well I don't I
don't think that a beacon game to scream
we're going brah X come the old one is
the old ones a lot more micromanaging
I'm sure that's not a bad thing if you
like you know just to get in the depth
of that game right but I don't know if
that'd be a good stream
uh yeah well you know I'm sure people
who are digging the game would love the
strip
Oh four of them okay so now I took a
picture
this door is still locked there for fuck
now I have I do have I have a data
uplink
to the guy who says open XCOM be perfect
there there were plenty of people who
are bored we're playing FTL
it's uni what people don't like in depth
games yeah yeah that's really true and
which is a shame because FTL is what is
is a game that I watch on live streams
on that's what that's how actually how I
found twitch was watching FTL live
streams ah cuz I really dig it but it's
one of those things where not a lot of
people play FTL I don't think and a lot
of times you'll only watch games that
you play oh my jams you don't hear about
that ah shoot yo ass good all day
congratulations hey but that this game
sucks really I mean yeah a 1064 first it
looks better than gonna I'm sure for the
time this was awesome I feel like the I
feel like right now itself you admit you
can make something fun out of this but
when did I come in everything so
confusing a map would be killer
they don't give spies detailed maps
places they're infiltrating Jack you're
right they always wink I came in I came
in from there I think did I come in from
this time yes cuz then I said oh my jams
but this is the door I'm going oh well
that's an all caps I kinda needs
business oh gee no offense but RL RL em
often makes big assumptions about people
or general audiences well nobody nobody
else does that
Oh what assumptions we need that shit
for an FTL when we were streaming many
people wrote that they were bored
that's not an assumption that's that's a
fact there's evidence that is an
observation yeah based on sure not
everybody but enough
picked up shield tech item okay I'm sure
some of you would like it yeah I like
where the fuck what the fuck
how the fuck okay and this one right all
right
we're damn it yes respected this is this
area whoa but I need the Sun will never
stream XCOM Jesus Christ I just heard
about open X come yesterday cut me some
fucking slack ha ha ha ha oh you did you
did doctor - it happened what did it
yeah you just had to get through that
door and that was objective - yay look
at her looking around looking for a
victory
Oh
dr. Carroll's in a computer yo Oh
oh my god dr. Carol needs to pluck them
eyebrows before uploading yourself into
a computer Oh dip yep the kind of person
owed up load themselves new computer do
you really think they give a shit about
their eyebrows I think they would I
think they would program themselves

transcend is I didn't see it either i
watch the episode no thank you change
his eyebrows did you know he just has
good eyebrows ha you jelly deaf come on
