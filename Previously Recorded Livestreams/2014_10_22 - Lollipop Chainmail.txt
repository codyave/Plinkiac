under their head they're stunned
what I'm pinning the button I'm hitting
the gun dear once mister there we go oh
my god why is nothing happening that my
fault the gameplay sucks it's true it's
so true
hey I said getting Jay to play is like
handing a world war 2 that the
controller did you do it I don't know I
did something how you do it you have a
chainsaw is your name lollipop
she likes lollipops her name is Juliet
oh ok
she likes lollipops and she has a chance
up yes ok fine no I'm with you I'm with
her chainsaw hasn't built-in phone what
or chainsaws phone just chainsaw boat
where's this game called lollipop
chainsaw how am I supposed to go back
this way
No
don't go in that fire go down here yes
this is waiting go
well
oh okay
you don't grate j.j you need to use your
lion brain is he's using crocodile don't
use your Kraken opera there's nothing
happening here that's right back in
jay-z all you have to do is pogo jump on
bad guys to kill I'm used to two buttons
yeah now he's got four well I feel like
I'm hitting buttons and it's not doing
what it did before this is a nightmare
oh dude they're saying you're doing so
bad you're making me look good
wow that's embarrassing
trick-trick different button combination
she might do different loops that's what
I'm kind of trying to do but everything
just makes my hands turn into pom-poms
it's junk did Jay just wake up from 1942
or some I think you're doing fine right
why nah
oh hey that's good
yeah I feel like okay that's the jump
button yeah that's the pom-pom button
the pom-pom button right I'm hitting
these buttons and everything is just
pom-poms and jumping yeah well
oh yeah you're right Jay needs to find
a fire flower or a tanuki feather and
then he'll be fine I don't know what any
of these things mean oh oh yeah yeah
every rich dust has taken the controller
for me and I guess he's right I'm trying
to find the many to show you what what
kind of moves you can do but oh that's
the menu there somewhere
yes I guess I don't have many unlocked
right now I got you okay
like like triangle triangle axe yeah
like that'll do a lollipop menu we know
how many lollipops you have five out of
five hey J is supposed to be my backseat
gamer
Hey look I'm gonna get a lollipop you
can eat a lollipop another store help
oh they're asking if this is your
favorite Zelda game it's not
I'm getting coins oh that's good that's
like Mario yeah there you go this this
is a ripoff of mario this coins and
break things and coins come out yeah the
Martha Washington says I I never seen
anyone get defeated by the men you can't
do anything oh oh no it doesn't help
that the sound seems to be not in sync
with the video I don't know if that's
related to the stream or what but oh I
did something if you want
it's we can hear it oh oh I don't even
need these no oh okay
whoa parenting with combo move it's
working if that bus good whoa okay
try the move you learn I don't I already
forgot how I did it
geez try spinning that's a good trick
Jesse will not tell you her favorite
movie until you spell her name right
yeah that's very true
and even then I probably still love ya
they go every movie is my favorite right
yeah I just I'm not used to the
PlayStation controllers cuz I don't
think I've ever played one before that's
right
oh you can teach an old je new trick
Thanks crunches cream crunch I just
decapitated that guys scream crunch is
creamy yeah
someone is asking me what the history
someone said Jack what's the history of
Milwaukee what people and they move here
mmm and it's City you know what I lived
here I can tell you why we're called the
Cream City yeah I don't think I know
that it's color episodes they used adult
most of the moments exactly it's at
bricks we have very special cream
colored bricks and we used to
manufacture them way back in the day and
so a lot of our older buildings are this
lovely cream colored bricks and that's
why we're called the cream see having
anything to do with milk or cheese or
anything it's because of the rice cream
city bricks it's pretty cool that's the
history of mochi that's all jack rich if
you had to give one advice to an
aspiring game designer what would it be
rich hello game that's what that's what
I advice I would give to make a game it
would be great that's it
make a game and had everybody shit on it
because people are horrible assholes
like us the advice I can give you is
that of of a video producer which is
make something that you would enjoy
that's all of you I make stuff I like
and hopefully other people like it too
or say horrible things on YouTube you
know you do it try to make ourselves
laugh exactly
you don't know what do you do you jump
over their heads like that leapfrog
thing and use the chainsaw you'll do
that like jump over them and break the
chainsaw up son - oh that's always fun
wait what I didn't hear a word you said
I'm busy playing rich that's a better
question if we have to give advice to an
aspiring city designer what would it be
he's freeing colored bricks here's what
I've seen that's been done before lay
out your Legend of Zelda of cities the
what I don't know I was trying to make a
joke about this is all the stuff earlier
but I'll distract it because I'm trying
to kill zombies whites Oh No that guy's
dead make your streets in a grid-like
pattern cuz we got some fucked-up
streets here in Milwaukee home on the
end on angles and they're not they're
not a zombie now Jack perfect grid
pattern
well who cares I'll just kill him on hey
no he's stronger than normal zombie this
is fresh oh I see how it works yeah
that's why you spread by the way I I'm
gonna say this
when does the James Gunn happen yeah
this is just killing zombies now I
haven't even gotten to a cutscene how
did I skip any there's one the opening
game that we just never got we can go to
the main menu at some point wait for it
to play on its own but there's like a
whole intro thing for the game
oh my god where am I
look you gotta use a lollipop Jack I
don't know how to do that I don't know
what that means
how do you see our own I don't remember
right Spence the restart button is there
a give up button hey so I just want to
jump on mushrooms and collect coins mmm
doesn't get one
where's the head damn it all right now
yeah I gotta work of you this is Starla
so the iris is just gonna take the game
away from me oh there we go there we go
on youse all right you know how do I get
best circle button
and you had to make you baptized that's
good no you can't get rich rich what do
you think are about the alien isolation
whoa what this happens Oh Marco haha I
mean zombies I don't know what this
means but did you do your usual your
little special meter gauge thing oh
great you probably accidentally hit the
button that did that bow count but I
wasn't a bad time to hit that bus sure I
well that's why I did it on purpose
now you found the fun to walk on they
did yeah that's why the circles over
that one it targets a specific zombie oh
oh god damn it don't want to get
cancelled yeah it's the circle cutter
might as like pop up you're hitting the
button that doesn't regard it something
you're doing is hitting that but I'm I
hate this this is too many buttons
that's kind of what I'm doing well
that's good
Oh No
oh that's a good question rich does this
game have kill three no three something
like that did you know that real games
have good three it's got something
called Sparkle hunting Sparkle hug big
barkal hunting great you kill like the
more zombies you can kill in one blow
the more points you get
okay
yeah just got a phone or chainsaw oh
yeah it's in the chainsaw that was it
that's the story no system the service
that seems where the cuts its Boeing I
I hate kitchens but Jay only wanted to
play this for the James gun story yeah
there's no James gonna eat a penis I'm
very much a between levels okay
the character's name is Juliet then that
might be a connection to trouble you
miss you did miss the intro so there
wasn't intro animus primal said asks
Jack I have a question about patching in
a Skype call from Canada a lot into a
live stream can you help me with that
apparently not I want to say good answer
it was too much it was too much for for
my laptop to handle maybe when I have my
big computer in here we can handle it
better
I killed that lady yeah yeah
those just those two murders man your
own business but they're zombies they're
zombies so oh all right
Mariah I'm serious thanks for
subscribing you super appreciate it
are you guys doing the Wikipedia thing
again cut that out
or am I supposed to go what
nice done here yeah okay
Carol are you guys okay
Jack I have a question about keeping my
hair can you help me with that nope nope
nature took most of it I took the rest
best decision you ever made uh yeah ya
know now that I've done it I really
enjoyed
holy fuck and they're having
conversations with other men who have
also shaved their head it's always the
same everyone everyone loves it wants to
do it how's the wife feel about that
yeah she thinks it looks significantly
better than my background yeah if you
look back at those first couple of
that's the worst episodes I'm in
terrible they do whoa Sparkle hunting
why five zombies me go back in time
would you call is more yeah yeah
definitely
sooner sooner yep
Oh fun do if you have a question about
FTL riches here he'll answer once less
the FTL question I don't know if what
they're saying with no hair jacked looks
like he has canceled
yeah lost in Technicolor it looks like
James Gunn just wrote a hot girl runs
around with the chainsaw yeah that's
kind of all this is what you having it's
fine it's fine
buzz you know
my meeting place so I can get you to the
James Gunn stuff quicker you know I
already don't care anymore
Oh
oh that's a good question does the actor
who plays rich Evans remain in character
even when you're not recording he does
he commits that's not even his real name
that's just a stage name okay the FTL
question is rich in FTL are are there
any quests you do not accept
I don't know if there's any really a
good reason not to you can accept them
you don't necessarily have to complete
it in fact why did you skip a quest yeah
oh wait
are they talking about just events that
quest that you won't will won't even
bother with like like the the giant
spiders one is that I won't even touch
the template Pole yeah you don't wanna
you don't wanna do that
well fuck 5 mm red letter media says
you're welcome
he fucked by 2000 wanted to thank red
letter media for all the entertainment
thank you I'm gonna use a lollipop Jake
how do I do that
yeah accidentally almost hit at 17 times
so I'm just pushing buttons you need to
find that button device what is the
button push rich I know to get out of it
I push the circle but I can't get to
with the circle what happens any press
sir I jump okay how about triangle
triangle these don't do anything that
get me to that I post all those buttons
shoulders the shoulder but how about
select Bobby well fuck this I hate this
Oh see that's not it this isn't it video
games are stupid I'll stick the Octodad
for a while that was fun
Rich's idea of helping me is to just
take the controller and play the game
yeah this is rich plane now hey
where these days puffer so how many's
your star this is it one look they have
special suits their suit zombies so
maybe here chainsaw can't cut through
this huge I might my mouth stop working
for a second yeah
make them explode
right
no don't hurt Jerry you got him no I
love Jerry he was my favorite ring the
doorbell hey Morin three thank you for
subscribing the headphones on now
there's some talky stuff
Jack has the headphones oh my god
here it is day
I know he's trying to kill Teen Wolf
cut his arm off horse in a blood stream
I guess no you got you can do it you can
still you can still do it
the sound is totally out of sync the
capture oh okay you can look at the
captured thing what thing do it
what
okay I can see some James Gunn in this
worst birthday ever
yes
she does she cut off his head yeah why
not the arm oh that's fun
when at the arm cuz she knew she had to
kill him
no she's trying to save him didn't you
say something we can use to play throw
up and start the next level okay we
prevent so I go to the high school now
yeah
yes okay okay hey
it's a good question they want to know
rich yeah if you're wearing panties no
no I'm not do you want me if you want to
hear me say that we watch the fucking
review
he's gonna be a severed head isn't he
yeah
yeah just ahead yeah he's gonna like the
excessive swearing yeah
he's got a little tight
and she wears him okay all right no on
Anson I've no idea what I hit to do that
I got to take those headphones off to
Johnny I know they're driving me bonkers
oh oh okay
now I figure it out yeah that's great so
you wear your boyfriend's severed head
around with you know game he does some
special things sure oh yeah like she can
swing them around
sometimes Oh Sheriff that's fun that's
fun you get you do you win this round
game no cut you win this room cuts I
enjoy the cutscenes I don't enjoy the
game it's the exact opposite of usual
so they just made a little movie going
from cutscene to cutscene with a little
bit of slashing you would find this an
acceptable movie yes thank you that
lollipop I think I will
Shaq my little video game
that's Givens James Gunn uses that name
and everything oh really
yeah I don't know if it's like someone
he knows or what but that name shows up
and everything yes this is a suit of 51
game soon 51 game written by James Gunn
Marquand what oh you do you clicked on
the power of that oh you went ahead
power up does that mean how do I do
these things when I'm just hitting the
same buttons over and over what
I mean you shake them and coins come
Bobby I know you shaken oh there is what
yeah this is insane so you're buying a
moose I can't figure out how to do the
basic moves why do I need new ones
Wow goddamnit more of these zombies
you're right I ain't donuts J there's
only ten buttons on this controller you
need to I can handle the two buttons
Maxim that's the extent of it I know how
to jump and I know what 1u does the
chainsaw and like combos or anything
like that or completely a foreign
concept to me so okay hey rich can you
turn down the TV slightly they're
complaining of a slight echo okay we
have this we're listening to it on the
TV which is why you hear the slight echo
so that we should have fixed that
problem now
the new suit of 51 game already came out
right it was like killer is dead killer
is dead
that's that's the one that got him some
flack what flag did he get for that I
don't remember I don't pay attention to
things but I remember flare we talk
about flak cannons again yeah he got a
flat cannon okay and it worked out
really well for me
the genius rare therapy is on the other
person I'm gonna fight all the time I'd
rather be a person that has to fight all
the zombies yeah yeah because that's you
know I'd still have a chance here zombie
your fuck you smash it that's that's the
best anything is the best the good
zombie movies is the survival aspect to
us sure oh no you failed again I did
with the head her people are people
watching this frustrated that I'm not
doing anything significant as far as
like combo moves or whatever you have to
be doing in these games no no you know
mostly it was talking about the game at
going and we're having some internet
issues so the game stuttering a little
they're just making fun of all the
technical things not asking some
questions that I'm not gonna even bring
up there any good questions yeah I
thought this guy's legs and I stabbed
him okay if you were fighting zombies
this is my own question okay if you guys
are fighting zombies what weapon would
be your choice weapon like a gun yep
zombies security makes bring more them
to you
I mean is there such thing as a silencer
Pro bar bar yeah that's a very close
range right yeah you're ideally you
don't get in too close ran you just stay
away from them as much as you can but if
you had to yeah it's a Facebook or
something yeah that's the same baseball
bat can you can you effectively though
just destroy somebody's fucking head
with a baseball bat it's compared to a
crowbar oh yeah you know you can do some
damage with a baseball bat are we
assuming that we can use this weapon
well yes just assume that you can
you become proficient I would December
sort boobs oh that's pretty good I would
choose a slingshot slingshot oh that's
dumb here's here's my reasoning with the
slingshot reasoning you have a slingshot
you will never run out of ammo except
the rocks if you have a baseball fan
you'll never run out of ammo but but
it's also a slingshot is a ranged weapon
yeah it's not and it has some potential
to new no damage whatsoever already
minimal damage
sure like an expert well that's why my
question like a base on a kiddie
slingshot oh yeah I'm talking about like
a real slingshot you know this is okay
because when the zombies come Jeff you
can take the slingshot I'll take probe
our samurai sword the crossbow but you
can slingshot okay great that is the
most effective yeah I think sounds or
anything because a sword has the
potential good stuff okay yeah a
baseball bat all you have to do is plug
in their brain and then they're dumb
because you want to just go through the
necklace or I think just a queen field
you're not always gonna hit it and
you're gonna go you couldn't slightly
better get stuck in in in a zombie yeah
blunt object it's gonna bounce off and
you go yeah fuck you Fitzgibbon
she want a lightsaber would be the best
that's probably true yeah oh my god
they're calling me a hipster fruits a
lightsaber would obvious I'm not gonna
call you a hipster I'm just gonna call
you a bad survivalist how many cans of
beans and stuff would you have though
all the beans I have all be with a
slingshot
I could silently take out zombies from a
distance caught the goddamn window
radiant there you go you know I guess
I'm yeah it depends on how good you are
how effective a slingshot it is what
though with the projector I want an X
and a letter and I'm not even gonna use
the ax on the zombies I'm gonna use the
ax on a staircase and I'm gonna camp out
the second floor of a house and I'm
gonna pull the ladder up behind me after
I get in all right you have to move from
locational okay yeah what is this thing
oh my lord
oh that's all that's his body that's
funny
yeah like you know you just think chef
but let's say you know like obviously
you try to get the like ball bearings
those that'd be the best right if you're
a good shot or else you just pick up
some fucking nuts and bolts and rocks
and and mildly annoy the zombies no no
like have you seen real slingshot errs
they fuck shit up I guess I haven't so
there there is a YouTube channel called
the slingshot channel oh wait what am i
doing and what your guy makes I stopped
paying attention to the game and I think
I killed my boyfriend oh no oops this if
you could break a skull with a slingshot
destroy a skull with a baseball bat
I'm assuming you can break through the
skull with a pebble I think you guys are
over confidence in your baseball bats
ability to break soul yeah I wouldn't I
would make a silencer birds or it just
like Sam I'm thinking of longevity with
the baseball bass with a crowbar I think
a better chance of just caving in
someone's skull yeah most you can use
the Jimmy open doors and see muster up
the crowbar is a good idea but even
something like a hammer or like a small
light you know like those ice climber
tanks you know something where you can
definitely pick might get stuck on that
pick might get stuck in there but you
need that yeah you need that penetration
you a regular hammer would probably be
the best it's really close range boy I
don't like a baseball bat you wouldn't
get too tired sorting that oh that's
true
baseball back retire you are constantly
having to swing
yeah well then it all depends on the
environment you're in - like if you're
out in the country where there's more
spread out and there's less of them yeah
then you know you can survive while the
base was plated yeah numerous all B's
okay yeah
oh sure well and I think I think you
need some sort of melee weapon and a
ranged weapon option and guns you're
gonna run out of bullets always do
mm-hmm and so maybe that's the thing you
get to choose one ranged and one this
way I picked the two I did
of course you also have to defend
yourself from other people yeah yes
which in the Romero zombie movies those
are the bigger threats yes
starving fucking pie fights are the
zombies and Donna the deadly they're not
the problem we should we should play
Dead Rising here one of these days yeah
that's the zombie game where all of the
like the boss encounters are just other
people kind of gone a little bit a
little bit nutty oh okay yeah oh fuck oh
by the way we are forgetting like a
shovel not not like a like a spade but
like you know like military shovels you
know they like fold up and are also like
axes and chopping to it like ever see
that YouTube video about the the Chinese
Army's combat shovels no but I can use
them in 40 different ways shovel that's
a good that's a good thought
a world war one in trench life sure yeah
whoa get off me dude can I be sweater
vest oh nothing I don't know my YouTube
hit my YouTube history is probably all
Taylor Swift videos I wouldn't say that
out loud
mm-hmm no Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj
Yeah right
oh this is good but it would be scary to
get that close and and pickaxe is a
two-handed weapon and I would I would
not want a two-handed weapon by the way
that kind of goes against the samurai
silligan because that's a two-handed
weapon right yeah if used correctly I
guess that's it's like I think you need
that you need a one-handed weapon and
one for you know you need a sharp suit
it's super embarrassing or fair well
that's probably more cumbersome than the
shark suit the shark suit facing is
almost like chain mail the diver reviews
when you oh okay I think you meant like
dressing up in the costume of a shark oh
no I meant a shark fruit swimming suit
okay sure that makes sense
yeah real prevent fights yeah good idea
a suit of armor
they're like medieval times all over
again then you're like Kevlar armor
they're just preventing against a human
life yeah yeah oh that's right the best
weapon against the zombie is a roof yeah
that root get up on that roof yeah if
you just destroy the staircase and
you're stuck there basically whoo you're
right beyond infinite can we discuss the
more prevalent threat of puppies mummies
are dumb assholes there's nothing scary
about mummies mummies don't try to eat
you they are just reanimated bodies
wrapped up in gauze basically they
lumber around they're slow they're
stupid
mummies are that kid in junior high that
you steal the glasses glasses and throw
them over his head to your friends and
you just throw them back and forth no
well why does mommy is gonna
revolutionize mummies it's gonna change
how people think of mummies were you uh
high school I am I absolutely am mummies
are the worst monster no what were you a
bully
I was not a bully sounds like but I know
no I didn't do these things take jacks
classes and gorillas I would not I'm
just
that mummy is like that's the kind of if
there was a mummy in my junior high he
would be the kid that would get picked
on the most ya know you would be scared
of a Wolfman we would not be scared with
mommy what if this mummy was really cool
when we cool though we're talk about
traditional mummies here not some sort
of weird to like cool version of a mummy
because those don't exist mummies by
their very nature new you're talking
about ten-year-old movies they're new to
me because I'm an old man Jay does bully
jackets studios it's true yeah every day
I've stolen his glasses three times
today I wish you okay see these people
agree with me from the hotel
Jack just keeps the wedgie it isn't
bother and the hotel the only people
that you can pick on are the elderly
though he cannot defend himself against
a younger person I like that movie but
he just preys on old people because he's
weak because he's a dumb mummy yeah just
being specious what's that specious
mummy is human really that's true my
mommy is even there was a reference
those are kind of different species they
all heard that how does the best
Universal monster
frankincense all all the Frankenstein's
Frankenstein's monsters the best you
know so ok
he said Frankenstein Frankenstein roll
but no inside crankin apostrophe s
thanks and that's that's the most
interesting because he's sort of a
tragic figure
yeah I never cared much for Dracula

iterations of them what's your favorite
