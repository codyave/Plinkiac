paying attention to the chat oh wait
black remember I remember yeah yeah
that's a good didn't know the movie but
he's doing okay you guys haven't got it
yet I mean you're kind of getting most
people have guessed correctly that that
is a woman or girl of some kind
yeah so good job on that hunger um
Jamie to log in here I can no longer at
the winner okay let's pull up and find
his name yeah yeah Lee logging me out of
the chat yeah so I've been trying to
tell Avenged
eleventy fold that he got it he got the
correct answer of Sophie's Choice yeah
what Sophie's Choice but uh
oh it stream is offline so worried
they're not hearing us oh wait no no no
no it was Sophie's Choice avenged 11
default got it first and then as soon as
we mentioned that that he won it crashed
and so it's your fault avenged way to go
but look at this look at this great
Sophie that's a great Sophie's Choice I
don't know that's what happens in the
Nazis forced her to choose one of her
cancers net the gist of it I've never
seen it yeah
I honestly don't know anything beyond
the title I thought it was like ideal
they would only let her take one of her
kids with her when she was what I
thought it was like a health thing were
like one of her kids could like you
donate a kidney to the other kid but he
might die and so though parent had to
choose whether they both might die or
they both might live what is a chat
what's Sophie's Choice look I don't have
time for Sophie's Choice I got so many
other
because I have to see like Silent Night
deadly night part 2 yeah okay I have
priorities okay it's your tongue okay
I'll try not to kill the dream no
someone just copy pasted the the plot
really yep it's really about now yes I
had no idea was about the Nazis I didn't
know either they will there you go
thank you that's one of those movies I
know the title but I never knew what it
was actually about yeah
okay great platform of doom um yeah I've
seen this a couple times to the people
who say like no half in the bag for a
month they kept busy guys just came out
I'm currently editing the best of the
worst that is about three episodes worth
basically there's going to be a late
December glutton
yes content I mean also you know they're
making a feature-length movie also
they're the ones who package up all of
the merchandise yeah I'm I was hoping I
was hoping one of you got that one okay

slow mode can I write text if it doesn't
pertain
like it's like quotes in the movie no no
no no no words no words at all you can
you can draw quotes from the movie sure
sure okay just want to make sure I
assumed not but I wanted to make sure
cuz I have something very specific in
mind that I'm gonna do here yeah okay
okay here okay we are now in slow mode
all right
and Jains 30 it is not Caddyshack you
are wrong and you wasted your slow mode
guess it's like how like their their the
plan here is to get an early guess in
just in case yeah yeah just in case they
can stab but then by the time 45 seconds
comes around there might be actually
something drawn okay oh my god this s
Joby s Joby 89 how in the world I think

fun and I think this is a unique the
next blinky review spoilers there was
blood that's my favorite aspect of that
movie is that the title basically tells
you where it's going what direction is
that he does so great okay I think this
is an interesting thing to do
I'm unwrapping I'm wrapping it oh god

others would get I wrote a few that I
really wanted other people to get and

Oh Mario Mario it's true I am a terrible
drawer that'll be fun I can think of a
way okay give me a second here to think
I can do this you guys don't even know
how much I got this visualizing is the
poster
nah doesn't seem like it should be that
hard either
let it flow Jay they can start
guessing now they already have starting
if somebody can someone gathers someone
gets to White Christmas
oh because that's funny yeah I can tell
you how I would have done it
yeah what's your why you tell me once ya
know it's you know but that's part of
the fun is kind of like forcing you to
draw without thinking you know okay yeah
they are though they're just throwing
out names because they might oh that's
funny I won't say it though okay all
right all right in crocodile brain you
are wrong
you can do it Jay we believe in you
doing something okay more than a else
once I get some color right so I'm
saying it's another Clive Owen movie
this guy does look a lot like Clive Own
everybody Jay draws looks like this is
really it's not necessarily the easiest
thing we do this is time trying
this is tom drawing clive owen
I'm trying to close this off so I can
color this in
That's a movie, spacekimo
What are they saying?
Mr. Roger Goes to Prison
I don't think that's a movie.
Is there a skin tone, a skin color...damn it.
Gonna make his hair white.
Don't say that out loud.
This is what I picture my picture you when I'm drawing.
know but that's fine oh oh there it is
yep gonna Phase II gonna Phase II gets
the naked I would have drawn just a
regular gun as good as I could never say
I would have started playing like censor
bars over it I hope you would have been
confused by the censor bars I think if
you just drew a dick yep the naked gonna
I'm gonna Phase II excellent guess I saw
it like a couple guesses before that was
spy hard and it's like I miss Leslie
Nielsen everybody does everybody does
it's really true everybody misses Leslie
Nielsen everybody misses George Palin
yeah everybody misses Phil Hartman yeah
mrs. Phil Hartman yes yeah because he's
from this area
sure he's from Milwaukee huh and I saw
him at the the deli near my old
apartment one time he must've been
dumped or something
sure and it was mom lived near my old
place people are saying his hand is
confusing it's a fucking Mouse we're
drawing in ms paint
what are those things called like a
stylus or tablet yeah like a lottery
Williams could do it
Freddie Williams I don't know Freddie
Williams could do it with the mouse oh
my god this would have been a great day
was fine ice but like a welcome maybe I
don't know it's I've heard it for now
I've heard it pronounced both ways a
wacom and awaken either way Freddie
Williams I have a feeling would blow all
of a side of the water or would he take
far too long because he wants to be
detailed
those were Holloway yeah yeah I agree I
was like I was almost literally rolling
on the floor track bad sky Danny you're

disgusting to me Monster is the only I
drink monster once a year for B fests I
buy a 4-pack and I drink it throughout B
fest let's the only energy drink I ever
had yeah aren't they like a thousand
calories each it's a lot it's too much
yeah that's still quite a bit for a
beverage honey yeah
is this make me feel funky so I don't
drink them and I don't think they taste
very good
but with with B fest they're necessary
to give you energy they do follow but
then they also make you crash war and
b12 b6 have you ever seen the movie role
models the David Wain movie no no Paul
Rudd and what's-his-face Sean William
Scott

drink company and so it's like a montage
at the beginning of the movie of them
going
school to school like trying to tell
people to stay off drugs kids safe drugs
drink Minotaur let's say they're
drinking drink a Minotaur instead and
then during this montage it just shows
them both in like a public restroom and
they're urinating in the urinal and
there's their piss stream is like neon
green cuz all the energy drinks yeah you

oh right after you gotta grab him every
single person yeah it was it was the
buttons that did the simplicity of it
like if this was a criterion release
this would be the cover yeah criterion
covered excellent excellent job grandma
one I remember like 12 13 years ago my
friend Ryan suddenly had the urge to
revisit the wizard so we walked down to
the video store cuz video stores still
existed at that point and we walk in he
just immediately like bolts up to the
front counter and user knows hi do you
have the wizard like you said it's just
like that this so bizarre Elvis Elvis
thanks for coming by why why isn't the
wizard I'm great it's a very good
question for maybe because it's a 90
minute commercial all right great
okay yeah okay doable okay all right
here we go we're going oh end for those
of you who don't know what the whiz oh
yeah for those of you don't know what
the wizard is it's a movie about a boy

from home no bridges and Christmas later
or on the road bonding over a Nintendo
to catch up to the little kids yeah
never seen oh really
yeah everything the waves as much as I
like Nintendo I never cared to see him
you should see the Wizard it's pretty
bad yeah it is what it is and a little
kid who is like super good at Nintendo

a pretty bad movie don't know if it's oh
rich give us some of paper I want to

season of the yeah great twitch is going
through a transitional period right now
it's user bases growing exponentially
it's it's also dealing with its merger
with Amazon but they're still using
their their servers but its it's the
fastest-growing website there is right
now is that true that's true as far as
the user base is concerned it's it's
getting incredibly popular well as the
solo game live streaming thing gets more
popular so we have to we have to breathe
with its growing pains growing pains
we're back yay
oh we're saving this one you gotta save
the silver shamrock I said have you ever
seen this movie Jack howlloween
following three season of the witch
no maybe no mate I mean I've seen them
all at some point it's nowhere in my
memory okay well it's I I avoided it for
the longest time because I knew Michael
Myers wasn't at it it's a standalone
movie it has absolutely nothing to do
with the other Halloween movies but it's
great as its own weird-ass Halloween
movie Amazon will help twitch is
infrastructure but it just happened yeah
it hasn't happened yet
nobody likes Google+ right well you can
stream you can do like Google Hangouts
right or you can live stream Google you
can live the stream to Google or to you
to see YouTube yeah but which is
something I looked into for the annual
stream Athan yeah but I decided against
it oh I like the layout cuz you stream
is pretty similar to Justin TV which we
used before sure and I like that it's
very simple and straightforward yeah
YouTube's a little funky you know
YouTube is a little funky who the hell
is chard I'm assuming they're they're
confused at my steam username just just
think about it for a little bit why
would you why would you jet J why would
you assume why do you think my name my
username is chard well I know already so
it doesn't matter okay I know I talk
about things and we can we talk about
things the movie
No damn it that's a bad movie
ever Oh hump jay baer the stream the
annual stream sign will not be recorded
but it's not like this where we're
talking and stuff it is just a weird
things playing on the monitor and a chat
so it's a different thing than this it's
not like we're you know riffing on
movies or anything if you can make it
great I'm gonna play some weird stuff I
got some new things lined up this year
it's gonna be good for those who can't
see which is all of you I'm very excited
about the movie I was telling you about
on Wednesday yes I'm very excited to
watch that again and know it's the
stream will not be on Twitch no it'll be
on Ustream well I'll probably within the
next week or so I'll post something on
the website with like a schedule I mean
it's time to make a schedule because
I've been busy as dean yeah but go to if
you follow red glitter media on Twitter
I can only assume you'll tweet when you
stream yeah yeah I'll probably post the
link to the stream beforehand to would
like on the website I'll post like a
rough schedule and save so whenever I
have a chance to make one probably after
Christmas right after Christmas I'll say
somewhere around there okay it's the
first it's yeah January 1st January 1st
it's the hangover stream then I did the
last one yeah okay this is Ryan
Shanna's asking if my fiance calls me
Richard when she's mad at me she she she
gets much more colorful than that her
name is kind of smoked a little bit
unusually so I started calling her by
thick the last part of her first name
just to emphasize how it's spelled
different okay and then shortly shortly
after I almost burned down my
grandmother's house calling me charred
that makes sense alright alright your
turn it's my turn is this way is this
about me or yeah we're still in some
only way over starting again yeah we're
not in sub only at the moment we need to
okay this is a sub only guess Athan what
okay I can do this I can do this okay
who added that one 9fc yours isn't oh
really okay okay you know my okay rich
is looking at chat I have to remember I
know I know this okay ready
Thunder bud says hi rich
hide under but I've been here for a
while something you have to let's just
showed up just want you to say hi back I
said hi
well there you go hi dr. bud what the
hell I had it in my head and I was it
was much better in my head okay
Oh someone got it hey JEP versus the
world's media this is like the cover
this is the cover of meteor man yeah I
find it that I might have just drawn
like a meteor sure and then a guy that
makes sense
I mean streaming
