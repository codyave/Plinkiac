have it I guess where'd it go
uh I was over your head and now it's not
is there a starter selects we can you
see your inventory no all right well
that's fine what's locked now oh oh
maybe that door was locked before you

people should be together
oh it's night no no no kind love the
pixel sex
are you under the bed oh you can hide
under the bed oh all right
for when the Moyer comes cuz we can only
assume at one point there will be a
mitre whoo flashlight
there's a door oh that's me peek you
can't go in you sure that's a door what
does that that looks like a door man
look at that looks like a door
all right maybe that key does something
where's another guy sergej exe has a
story about Ishtar yeah apparently his
dad was oh I got him the key oh oh nice
his dad was a chef at a popular
restaurant in New York and then when he
was working on a night while they were
filming he saw Warren Beatty and Dustin
Hoffman at a restaurant upon hearing
this I asked how were they looking and
he said not great they were drinking
pretty heavily oh the on Ishtar's
opening night okay so apparently they
knew they knew what they had done thank
you for sharing sergej exe why is this
door locked now oh I can't go in with
the tools in the door for some reason
that seemed stupid what do I need these
for Oh was there a hammer oh oh he hid
does something weird happened I wasn't
sure what was going on
did you that oh I did hear that
who was that I don't know check all your
people where's the lady she's fine
they're fine they're fine both fine
they're having some good sex you know I
mean they're still going at it well we
don't know if it's good sex it's long
sex you know like who knows if they're
both still into it at this point or if
they're just kind of getting bored
waiting for it to wrap up or something
to happen I don't know what's supposed
to happen you can't go past that thing
no okay well they probably you you got
the key from the bed so you can probably
stop having sex I got a hammer out of
the butt I met fun Oh
so coffee okay okay let him have fun
oh you're hiding in there in the
cupboard
oh oh it's morning time what in the the
other lady the non-sex lady yeah is
there like there's like a weird piece of
wood by her like what's that over there
can the guy hammer that Oh Oh sex
no oh I can use the hammer though that's
like a weapon oh great
don't hate no I'm not going to don't hit
her in the head what is that look
that's weird right but there's like not
what says oh maybe have to get across
can you hammer it oh oh the puzzle I
just did a puzzle you did a puzzle you
probably can't go in there cuz there
doesn't seem to be any sort of landing
that's one but there's an exterior door
over there why can't I get in here
oh I thought there was no landing did
you think I couldn't figure out I
thought I thought that was the bottom
you've lost your foot Oh No get it
together rich can I put it back on no
you can't put it back on I can hit
someone with my foot though the hammer
is a much better weapon is my foot you
seem to be walking just fine without it
okay head back up yeah
and there's there is it like a next yeah
okay
here we go and now you can yeah there we
go now we're puzzling now if you let go
will it go back down I guess it doesn't
matter
who's that I don't know I don't know who
wouldn't
this is this game was kind of great
what's that on the ground
oh no be the lady all right looks like a
scythe or something all right you're
done he needs to be kept naked no I
think we're done you don't want to oh my
god
you don't want dongers hanging out I'm
not really all right not really no
dongers no boobies
oh wait take your clothes off I
understand no no no okay she just wants
to throw them she doesn't want to wear
undies okay that's fine maybe it's goes
to briefs Oh naturale maybe he uh my god
maybe he is more likely to wear the
undies okay I like what what did you go
hit it hit the hammer the same button
Auto dos all right good
dongers and boobers no no dongers and
boobs okay you can ride that though
right we
why is this so great
sometimes spookiness is fun I love how
that guy's just still holding that thing
I'm gonna take your hammer
that's my hammer it's my hammer now
No hey what what hey hey now oh my lord
she's who a generator Oh what happened
you did it I did I don't know I can only
assume that's what bloodline means Lily
oh oh look there's like an eye on the
side of the thing now what happened you
were out here you tell me what happened
lady hammer and you're getting off the
bike that's dangerous
motorbike hammer it would be so easy I
mean you should probably know I gotta
try this right okay okay trying to
that's right
who is that an axe
okay okay is there something new that
needs to be cut down apparently not
Oh Oh the door the door that had the the
wood on it okay
okay the bathroom yeah yeah yeah we're
headed that way yes yes please hammer
don't hurt him nice tiberius nice Oh
fuckin rage the one-legged guy you know
he said Oh what the fuck
if so the kids a beer probably Oh
probably beer yeah oh nice
nope I mean it's gotta be something in
it like oh this is the second like music
what's that doing oh oh light switch
that's a light switch I don't know if
this poop it's probably important then
that music think that light switch I oh
my god
it was important okay well now going to
the other bathroom and turn off the
other light I can't you can't what can
you do over there just leave you
probably needed that music thing but
musically I think was the light switch
no there's like a music record that you
broke with your ax can you get in the
canoe oh oh you just broke the rope to
the canoe Ridge well I'm trying to get I
figured I'd meet two to get in the canoe
how do I get in the canoe oh why did you
just get naked is she trying to
skinny-dip oh here we go
you just jump in the water okay oh it
needs gas you had a gas can earlier no
okay I guess
Tiberius Kirk says okay you've been
bleeding a really long time now and
you're wielding an axe you may be the
serial killer and not knowing that's
very true
keep holding that thing footy people
have to get around okay can you just
keep going oh there's a rock there so
you probably can't go further than that
rock yeah yep alright so what's the
purpose of all this you didn't try going
the other way okay
Oh who's that oh I'm trying to give out
of me you probably to go to the doc but
you are skinny-dipping
I mean you're a bloody mess but you're
skinny-dipping oh there we go
there's another like Locker thing maybe
being put some put some damn clothes on
yeah don't fall off another thing how
did he get here he fell off where he was
now he's um oh wait did someone die oh
that lady died that lady died and
there's a blood trail leading to that
man must that are beardy no it goes
beyond oh my god and what leg matt has
been severely injured oh that's true oh
my god I think I think when you're not
using someone they need to hide yeah
that makes sense
oh wait is she alive now I see a corpse
can you be here she is corpse she's
corpse okay when you're not using people
you they have to hide okay they're in
the woods now Tjader 8.45 we have no
idea what's happening in the game either
so we think you know so far it's just
been basic puzzles you know like almost
almost like point-and-click adventure
but Nina inna in a 2d perspective all
right so what is doing her this is have
we done with this puzzle
oh well that maybe you turned it on
before right oh you just turned off all
the power
do you need to turn off the power I
don't know oh it's morning oh oh wait
you're stuck well no oh you have to swim
can't bring the light yes there's still
like a gas can that I'm sure is
something yeah I'm good what
nitro inferno rich and I are together I
mean we're not you know we're together
where we are in the same room
we are not skyping tonight that poor
corpse he lady you know at least she
went out fucking or you know had some
good fucking tonight now what you didn't
go out fuck oh wait there's like a zip
line look at that oh the killer the
killer rich yeah well whistling okay I'm
on a boat I go by him yeah but your
other people they're hiding are that
well go you go check on them
go check on them rich they're fine
no they're go check so what the killers
coming oh I know he is I know this but
the killer can because he's blocked Plus
what happens can the killer get through
if he can't I think I just figured out
how to solve this mystery
no he can okay
did he kill everyone they look pretty
alive I mean they looked can you switch
to them yes okay good they were hiding
ooh spooky kill earnest okay
all right so what do we do with that gas
can what is our plan what are we doing
well let's go to the drive to the other
side of the of the of the drive to the
other dock and let's just see what's
over there you never went right there is
a zip line right there so that might be
something maybe that's just like a way
to escape the killer if you're caught up
there that zip line light goes all the
way oh there's a wood chipper that looks
like a wood chipper there's a backpack
there's life jackets now and on a rock
all right back think oh so I'm in the
backpack what is that what is that I
don't know I think that's a brick
oh what's this that looks like a flare
that looks like a gun oh my god next
time you see the killer you got to shoot
him with a flare gun
oh good gasping and shoot the gas tank
there you go and then you can kill the
killer oh there he is oh he's in there
oh you put down the flare gun did I yeah
well this is please think of your foot
oh it doesn't matter
get out of there get out of there get in
the boot oh no no no no where does he go
he can't go in the water I can't get in
the boat anymore it's okay he can't go
in the water
why can't get in the boat you don't need
to get in the boat what if I need the
Pope oh it's that first be like yeah
there's like yeah over there maybe nope
all right you can't get in the boat
anymore you fucked that bridge you
probably need the boat at some point
okay the fiower you got to get that
flare gun
you seem very convinced that the flare
gun will save us it does start things on
fire next time you try shooting the bad
guy with the flare gun oh the bad guy
could be anywhere rich what was that Oh
run away Oh oh you're out of flares you
you son of a bitch rich this right you
know I'm gonna say there's multiple ways
to do this we just don't know them you
didn't turn on the wood chipper nope oh
I was gonna pick something up and try
and throw it right oh oh that's okay you
have two people left you have two people
left I don't know what I'm doing you
have to we have to kill this guy some
hobby so you have to kill him
I don't know if turning out the lights
will help anything well I don't know if
anything will help anything man Touche
what is that oh no did you just die yes
well you have a scythe now we have a
bloody nude woman with a scythe but
she's your best hope he's not he how did
he start on fire that's a very good
question that I don't know the answer to
how the fucking hell did he start on
fire
she is the virgin well no she was she
had a clothes on top of a guy well no
she was like humping the lady's face so
she could probably still be a virgin you
know Sheree she was fully clothed on top
of one guy and then humping a lady's
face I'm gonna say virgin I know what
I'm gonna try I don't know that it's
gonna work okay what are you gonna try
what's the plan what's the game plan oh
oh he lost his ax oh you can totally
fuckin site this shit out of him now
it was on fire there doesn't matter yeah
because you could probably pick it up
and throw it out of
oh my god Richard what what is your plan
I am so scared right now
did he see you I don't know I don't know
oh good okay what's your plan this house
pokey are you gonna zip line and hit him
in the face
no no okay oh I know what you're gonna
do
yeah that's a good plan do you think
it's gonna work I have no idea jack okay
great this is a quality plan okay nice
okay okay be very shut up we need to
make some noise to lure him over here
wait wait no it this is this is a serial
killer we have to make sex noises okay
okay okay we need to have a talk about
okay Shh baby bitch Oh who's that
all right oh you'll have to kill had
enough you have to kill him multiple
ways but he dropped his axe again all
right what do we do next what do we do
next
I think we got a zipline him into the
wood chipper Oh what is that another
killer who is that that's a boy a body
is just a dummy P what the fuck who's in
what do we got
music why is music important any
I'm sure oh oh you have a gun I think
that's gonna help
I'm just gonna put put this out there I
really think that's gonna help I kind of
adore this jack yeah yeah okay oh oh
shit you don't have any bullets she
don't have any board oh shit yeah count
Oh son of a bitch where the bullets how
the fuck should I know
throw that fire thing at him Oh where'd
he go
how do we get him in the wood chipper I
think we got a zip line them your zip
one theory is weird
yes yes sir they don't like it it's it's
silly it's well it's dope you're just
okay he doesn't he didn't see you you
need to find some bullets were the
bullets that um maybe that white thing
that was in the backpack that package of
white thing yeah all those white bullets
you know could be a box of bullets I
don't know
we phone upstairs right maybe maybe no
no don't go I remember fall down you
fall down and lose a leg lose a foot leg
oh oh you can hit him with the motorbike
not enough okay so no it's not Oh axe
axe um oh no oh no that's his ex I guess
he has special power over that axe
oh that is just not a good hiding spot
it's all I got
oh shit he's ami yeah well it's not a
very good hiding spot he can't swim you
say you got that going for you he can
definitely see you in there though
people are telling me I just missed oh
that could be swung too late or too
early or something killem Canadian style
with love I don't think that's gonna
work there is a flaming thing I think
you could throw that at him that thing
is still on fire and I think that's your
best your best last hope
oh yeah you can get in the boat now
that's great oh don't always be
dignified you know oh you know what that
looks like that looks like a sock oh no
no it has a funk to it a metal funk
maybe that looks like that could be a
box of bullets I don't think so pick up
that thing I'm fired
I burned to death
oh I think that's maybe a /kup it's on
fire it's damaged okay that could be a
box of bullets I die I do you know I
have nothing indicating that you don't
think no okay
you can't get away on the boat there are
rocks there are rocks on either side now
pick up the fuck she's gotta go
searching oh we got this dead end okay
okay what rooms what is the thing on the
outside of this building by the right
window what is that oh it's a rocking
chair
get this fucking whoo I've stopped
regular confident I just don't think
that's good
mm-hmm Oh maybe I'll pick up that
backpack and throw it didn't something
come out of that last backpack as our 42
if we could rock him like a hurricane we
would he doesn't seem like the kind that
is rocked by hurricanes I mean there's a
zip line there rich how do you how would
you time it I don't know and you keep
bringing it up like it's this magic
bullet it's it's there you know like I'm
using my video game brain and say
there's a thing that's here the lantern
through our Lantern Adam yeah it's not
work I don't yeah oh we can throw things
in the wood chipper you could throw
their bodies in a wood chipper oh maybe
you have to like knock him down and then
throw his body in the wood chipper you
know this is I'm just no they don't
how do I even know it's a zipline at the
top of it has a thing that looks like
you can dangle weights or doors open
what that door is open that has been
open that has been open that I get blown
open I think that got blown open
if Ricky ever goes over there again I'll
show you there's a little dangle hold on
no no I'm not saying you have to just
whenever what is in that door you know
we're gonna solve this with the zipline
mister once for all the great supply
mystery that looks like a zipline to me
you might be right
how do you okay and so then my guess is
you'd oh oh it made a thing fall off
they made the weather vane fall off dear
booyah the answer is always zipline so
what is the weather vane do nothing
nothing I can't oh you know what it
would have fallen on him I bet all right
well that was well that was waste can
you pick that thing up no no try again
No
okay abz always be zipline oh oh
zipline twice saved twice all I'm saying
so next throw a thing on fire Adam you
don't think okay throw a dead guy at him
are supplying our OD mulcher is dead I
bet he turned off the power because the
light switch wasn't working either I
think I turns off Oh or you might have
turned it off oh okay
smokiness spookiness
didn't you can do a rich oh I think I
just Oh what what what what I think he
just uh no I did Oh yep he did so I
think when you go when he went past that
winch I'm a little big bling-bling hurt
you know and so I think maybe that's how
you can zipline him into the wood
chipper as he hear that Dingle Dingle
and then you and then you go he saw you
there last time he's walking slow
flashlight in the lake
zip lines did work for Kevin McCallister
that's true so you know you wait he
walks that way you hear the jingle
jingle zip while maybe none single
jingles the faraway wood chipper okay
nevermind all right yep never mind
that was a stretch where's that wood
chipper
I think we've usually wasted a lot of
our opportunities to kill him I think
that could be I think we've just fucked
up royally
there there has to be a oh you know what
is that a knife might be can you swing
that I can throw it
it made a metal clunks oh okay okay that
got him
I can throw it throw the fun thing I
fire at him I can't you can't throw it
no this is light oh I think you were
peeing in your pants that whole time is
that little droplets of blood yeah I
think so yeah we need a solution this is
starting to get old
you either oh there's a key there's that
key what do you want this is I'm just
telling you the things I see in case
they help you okay that's fair that's
fair all that time wasted on the cabin
foursome you say wasted I say we made
these people live their lives to the
fullest how's that I'm ash oh you have a
book of matches right now Oh where's the
gas can we blow up
oh that's right nothing yeah you really
need my god MC Lucas has a great idea
shit you see that yep I'm see Lucas we
are trying that next where's the I
haven't seen the brake in a while oh you
haven't tripped over the rain it might
even blown up
what else what else was the chat god I
like that the rake into the wood chipper
that's a good idea
can you be naked and seduce him with
your feminine wiles no I cannot now okay

the rake blew up am I am I out of things
are we doomed
yeah the Rick's wood chippers I got a

rinks busted now it's probably facing
the wrong way it's witches damn it damn
it damn it
no the rake is bust Oh No
just throw something at that ladies how
you doing good hiding behind a tree
I practice can't leave them in the lake
right like I probably doesn't work it
might drown after a while yeah I can
only assume you're already down to
people too yeah like one girl is dead oh
that's right oh shit okay so I only have
two to deal with okay so we have a gas
can yep this guy should not have had so
much beer and here's some matches oh
there's the gas tank great
can you pour the gas on the ground like
what happens leave there happens any
headaches it just throws
oh there's oil and there's gas in the
ground so you could don't waste it
that was well I would thought I could be
fast enough what what the fuck was that
I thought your matches are wet you just
lost the matches what you just lost the
matches there's more matches it's okay
there's more matches alien isolation
alienation but in 2d you have more
options than this than you didn't alien
invasion this traps do you notice how
we're playing the game it's it's not
linear right you're not walking to the
next thing you're supposed to walk to to
hit the next button that's the button
you're supposed to hit next
what's brewing how's that other girl
doing I assume she's still hiding but I
have no idea
switched over quick yeah she's like hi
where's this fucker I got a knife
there's another thing of matches oh oh
he already broke through this thing
I lost bad no no can you hide behind one
of those trees he started a lot quicker
with you well they probably know
broken rake probably not gonna do much
wait what's be over the Ellison's hide
then and why is the axe on his head is
the act he's the axe balance murderer
right you glitched him earlier
oh that's why I haven't yet well I threw
a knife at him so that slowed him down a
little bit I need to find there's
another book of matches this flare gun I
don't know there is another book of
matches well there's a flare gun then
the zipline with the thing and there's
the zip line with the thing yep and
there's the motorbike still I can hit
him with the motorbike okay let's see
the motorbike it was over here somewhere
there it is did you have to jump off or
you just crashed into it I think I just
crashed into him okay okay I'm gonna do
that that's my next play I'm gonna crash
into him oh fuck he turned off the
lights okay here we go
got this thing - I'll do a lot of good
that box whatever it is nitro inferno
says I'm not a fan of this water retreat
strategy and I'm kind of with you on
that I'm kind of with you oh god what
the fuck young somebody up like a
scarecrow no Jack I'm so sorry well
listen I'm not a big fan of the water
retreat strategy either but you know you
do it works I suppose you could set
limits on yourself once you're better at
the game sure up fuck you oh no I had to
or else I'd die damn it well that ruined
Bank probably would love this game he
should come around to streams more often
I said I'm just gonna drink more just
gonna drink yourself to death that's my
plan
it's actually really hard to play the
game like this because it's all wobbly
yeah so you know this is how do I open
that thing I guess I'll just have
another beer we might have used the axe
when I did it where's the series like
matches I have a thing of matches come
on over here serial killer

he see me oh hey I'm burn another
campfire

super week strategy yeah it didn't seem
to do much damage to him though right
nope hide let him walk past a site
there's a site over here okay oh I miss
them I'm not gonna cite the strategy
