okay fits great
alright come on come on
that is not fit to screen that is
totally not fit to the screen reset
properly if I reset the cropping maybe
then nothing works on you Windows 10 go
home
we're gonna play there of fate
properties properties
let me try stretch image to screen let
me see if it'll actually shrink it to
the screen there we go there we go
you want to try it you owe me to try
wreckage here again I'll try record here
again real quick and hopefully that
won't fuck this all up or it'll just
make this worse I'm not I'm not sure
nope nope black screen
black screen
now
all right back to hand to fade I tried I
tried we're going back the hand of fate
interests no no there it is okay okay
one more for the game
you've passed 13 gates and you come to
my table to play the game of life Sam
I'm not using stream esteem both hand of
fate and Rekha tier I bought off of GOG
I mean second I'll tab over the
appropriate window is that good or is it
too much
how's that
Emily was now perfect all right
I'm saying a mix of a bit too much and
it's perfect now
too loud too loud
alright I'll turn it down a little bit
more
how is
Audio was good don't mess with it it's
good all right all right I'm running
with this I'm gonna get all dual that
how's everyone doing tonight
the game begins one lives and one dies
let us see what you're made of
here's the first member of my court the
jack of dust the lighting hair must fall
before you make challenge me
oh there we go
okay let's Jack in the chat what what's
going on oh the Jag of dust that's what
you're talking about
let the cards fall where they may we
begin yes I want to climb down and
retrieve the weapon I always want to
retrieve the weapon choose from these
options I'll take the sword place oh ok
I've had better nights but I'm not
having a terrible one so a moment to
savor that will make you much more
effective
I was never a fan of illusion or
pretense here I'll make an exception
you can now reflect your opponents
ranged attacks using your shield make
good use of this skill if you wish to
survive fair Mareth I'm not surprised to
find that this encounter remains I did
not see the witch and I have not seen
civil war yet yet I guess doesn't really
matter at this point
I'll take gold
I'm sure you are grateful for that
that's ton of gold or I'll need for this
basically tutorial stage where's Jack
Jack has kids that's where Jack is you
are on the final floor did you know
you're not you're not supposed to leave
young children at home alone unattended
find him did you know that if you defeat
me that's having kids you sounds
horribly early to be absolutely horrible
the angeles's let us see what you're
made of
you can now counter your opponents
attacks hit the counter button when you
see the flashing indicator
easy easy
your eye on the cards that's a safe one
good
Axew a peasant's weapon but effective
nonetheless source finer so it's like a
card game and instead of like some kind
of card kind of bad you have like Batman
combat it's fun I'm explaining things as
you can clearly clearly see you just by
listening to me you can hear I'm just
horrible at explaining what is going on
in this game and what do you do in this
game
but every every card is like an
inventing why you've been killed and I'm
sure most of you have seen must play
this for talk about this game before
push stop I didn't remember did we do a
review on this we may have done a
reaction prereq on this yeah we did we
did
sure the power of a prophet choose your
fate
yeah I'm gonna leave the shop I'm good
on everything you can always review your
cards here that's what correctly an
ambush Rd fair is it
guys get your puzzle easy
fine yet everybody needs to rewatch
blind fury because blind fury is an
amazing film I cannot expect you to get
by without some protection
you have reached my first champion a
good man driven to madness by a wall
that took all from him wife and child
kith and kin from such dark and brittle
iron I forged my tools now we see your
mettle
all right let's get on to the some enemy
attacks do not be blocked so County
actually another context puns much of a
challenging stage is pretty easy
actually I'm kind of pissed offensive
damage
matter breaks it's fine
job
not a very responsive dodgeball are you
Barriss minute is
Jesus that was embarrassing
somebody sent me Zed oeg ever washing
you that's the movie that's apparently
blind fury is ripping off I think I paid
for it so it's not illegal yet we are at
the start of our road you will face
eleven more opponents who will test your
strength your memories are you right too
much turkey that was pathetic you fall
at the first hurdle none reached the
last we have wagered and you have won
you may claim your rewards yet I will
also claim mine as you improve so do I
shall we deal again ah good now you
understand the basics we can begin in
earnest your hero is returned to his
beginning items our decks are reset
welcome to the cabinet home of the
members of my court
time for you to face my undead army meet
the Jack of skulls
yeah so I think there's an event were
basically guaranteed to get a mace
interesting this first time I've
actually played this with the DLC
chance cards are even easier I like that
combo multipliers I reduced s fine
I carry extra equipment
sounds miserable I heard about this one
all-you-can-eat us like your your items
or something like that oh my god
mmm
start with maximum and I start with low
maximum health but increases with each
defeated enemy up to a max of 200
can't wear heavy armor yeah
sorry I'm like completely unfamiliar
with all of these
what do you think what does everyone
think
obviously I don't think I'm up to
hardmode right now based on what
happened with the jack of does there
lion all right I'm gonna playing endless
mode though all right I want to unlock
them dark coins
what am I get rid of
new content awaits you it will be
awarded when you complete your run I
will add my own cards to the deck
how boring life would be without a
little spice
well ambush winding trail and the other
one I forgot what's called they're all
basically the same thing right they're
just kind of an encounter with with
enemies I don't think there's a
significance significant difference with
the rewards I always thought it was best
to avoid the problems of others I see
you have no such concerns
yes let's go
it's a lump of iron on a stick not
terribly subtle
yes I would like that equipped is that
what you're going to do it's the best
weapon I can have right now
oh I see can I not can I not put helmets
on then am I kind of stuck with the lion
mask you know I hate the Thundercats
right you all made me you all made me
pick this so cuz because you know I hate
Thundercats
you trolling me that's what you're doing
you guys you guys well done
running water protects against me lion-o
is like the lamest character in all of
fiction there's a problem there's a
problem when you're rooting for the
villains this token will unlock more
cards if you can defeat this encounter
coin
it's not the coin no it's not
oh dear now we're doing that again
because I want I want my token I want
that token shake consumes food but you
will also heal as you proceed there's a
token in it for you if you win
not the token
damnit
dimmer how much food we're at six given
how rarely one encounters the folk you
are fortunate indeed to meet Mareth
again or perhaps we are merely cycling
around the wheel and dipping into the
same memories time and time again
right that puppy some more attempts at
this river which I'm going to try until
I get that fucking token
how will you cross this time oh well I
don't even have the option now that
sucks fuck me
at downwards if you dare
go down the stairs many have reached
this far further in fact I do not know
if you have what it takes to do better
than they did
there you go
did I have a shield I don't remember
I do hope she'll
I'm sure you're grateful for that
that first moment that glinting weapons
the call-to-action to adventure I don't
really don't really need it but I guess
it's not gonna hurt to have more stuff
hurry up
I'm starting to wonder if you're simply
leaving this card in as a quick way to
get your hands on a shield
we've only bad things can happen I
already have a shield
yeah I forgot to change the name of the
stream oh well fuck it I'll change it
later already did not take my shield so
I'm happy with that
greed if it was not for greed then who
would play at this game a choice select
your desire
alright alright need to kill more dudes
oh yay wrong left arm is got that shield
I didn't write on after all one of my
cars a small benefit not 5x are each
take they have a long deeper towards our
foe good now all you need to do is find
and kill the Jack of skulls and we can
progress win this and claim my token
anything would have the card called
ambush ambush no skeletons for you to
deal with
all right so you guys have me take the
lion path hairs because you're hoping I
would get my ass kicked with a low
health those apples going on
Hey Amer
distinctly average what do you expect me
to say congratulations armor protects
you from damage the best armor of course
there's so much more I think is anything
I need to buy
there's will be the one thing you want
people to remember you by
no no I don't care I don't care what
people remember me but when I'm dead I'm
dead at that point nothing matters
literally nothing matters
a classes company to burn CDs so I may
as well take this shirt artifacts
provide powerful special abilities to
use in combat but it takes time to ready
them
then you know doesn't event were the
priest you need to give him money or you
need to give them food I might have just
enough either way I don't even know if I
have that card unlocked yet Chet likes
the the jungle book I don't turn all the
lies I don't know I the story never did
anything for me it's kind of like Tarzan
but not Tarzan he fights Tiger all right
whatever I don't care but I don't care
about anything I don't like anything I
hate everything cause I'm rich Evans
why are you showing this I don't need to
see a picture of it
have a skeleton's easier just made and
they used to block every now and then or
am I remembering that
I don't need any more crap whoo chains
afraid I'll take excellent way to turn
an injury into an asset ah one of my
food cards well done and good luck to
you so much gold I can use the undead of
all the plays in the game these are the
most dangerous in the world yet in no
natural form a wrongness an error
cheating
surprised I'm not playing XCOM - I
played a ton of XCOM 2 jumps from rifles
actually it wasn't screening those is
streaming right I was gonna play an X
commlite game tonight
well we ever play rocket League again
probably at some point I don't think it
makes for my best streams cuz I am
completely talking about nothing except
for rocket League guys a good shot just
that's all you get you can stream it
coming it now our wager becomes more
interesting will the tools you've earned
suffice to address the challenges I pose
I think and then we all know when I
stream that I'm not good at talking
about things and in general
ooh this is new
what are these coins from
this is all brand new to me is that all
just from using the the lion mantle
thing thingamabob
all right now I have the helpful first
shall we deal again
another round and out game truly begins
a bold woman this one she did not
collapse when the Empire did no she took
up arms organized her people and vowed
that in a country where death had
gathered she would be the one feeling
that's like a cycle in the new cards
oh my god all the stuff all the stuff
all right what do I want here what's
good I have no idea what's good
is there all new cards me I don't know
what the what the gains are what the
benefits are they're really difficult
this game is seriously lacking in
third-person shooting I would I want to
clarify something I know so I've ridden
you know reading some of the comments
and people have been taking it the wrong
way I am NOT saying that every
third-person shooter is a bad game in
that quantum break review because like
vanquish third person shooter what about
one of my favorite games of all time
vanquish what I am saying is that when
you want to make a story focused game or
when when when they make these story
focused games these linear dialogue
heavily scripted story games they just
make a lazy third-person shooter because
they don't give a shit about gameplay
I'm not complaining about third-person
shooters in general I'm complaining
about lazy ass bad third-person shooters
that they build talky-talk picnic story
cry a game around you that's what I'm
talking about I'm sure you know you can
add and remove cards from your deck but
feel free to familiarize yourself first
all right um we're good no no we're good
go back to the go back to the screen
where I do the things
now we play for the car first of my
symbols
I've added some cards to spice up the
game in addition to the pain and gain
tax there are now blessings and curses
choose your steps carefully subject play
the DLC once and he had these dice
things I don't know what they do though
I don't recall priests gods and
generally not gold I have none Dona Eve
I thought no drop with any of it you
fucker
you owe half the food don't do nothing
that huge success come on huge huge
success a success I'll take a success
blessings will remain always active and
are never removed unless and I of course
then you're back where you began as
always
the river a challenge for you and a
token if you succeed
great
yes got my River token
oh the dice share which encounters have
moments of chance ah how is that from
the the whatchamacallit card I took the
whatchamacallit card were you hoping
this was the end another floor awaits
gotta explore everything that's just the
way I roll ooh the land walk lover we
play for a token now
what is it Greg
all right well I got the token for doing
nothing for doing nothing I got a token
but that's fine I got the token I want
all tokens one more step down and we may
see the end of this or another set of
stairs
this game is still only beginning new
rules new tools new abilities we have
far to go as yet
all right goodbye some food this voice
acting Rin forever I like your name
because I think I know that's a
reference to but you say the voice
acting and this is terrible
no no you're wrong the dealer's amazing
I'm sure you a grateful for that
it's better than trudging along a muddy
road certainly it was not great for
getting more encounters shadow agent I
have no idea what happens here again a
token is at stake
take the token it is you're right Lois
that was an easy one
now
a horse is a fine companion
I'm sure you'll leave this one in time
you do not seem to have the temperament
for friends even in the animal kingdom
am i starting with a shield now because
if I am I need to get all of those out
of my fucking deck what happened to the
Japanese lair game is that Jack could
not make it in the night I know you and
for one he has the street he s but the
capture card I do not
and we're gonna do we're going to that
Friday I believe the plan is Friday
we're gonna have a make up stream it
lives in every game and the canyon has
been there from the outset
it's Friday that's when we're free I'm
not free tomorrow I've got something big
going on tomorrow so stream will happen
Friday Oh normal sort skip through so
much good equipment just for the normal
sword oh well fine
you might think the world tomorrow I'm
gonna be busy all night yeah it's even
in the darkness there is light to be
found so no stream or hanging out
tomorrow
well tomorrow was a civil war a Civil
War Reenactment I have to go to
as you plunder happy playing grant for
some reason I don't know why some you
wish you'd left untouched
sure I'll offer to help why not
it was fairly basic card all set done
all right
now we begin to raise the stakes the
arena itself will fight against you
yes maybe I should have taken the card
they gave me the better combat
multipliers
descend ever deeper into the
subterranean pit what term ins if I'm
part of a review for a half of the bang
whether or not Mike thinks I'm a comic
book expert when I haven't been into a
comic book store in 10 years you are
close on her trail and more confident
than I had imagined perhaps you will
play beyond this mark and we will see
your true metal crucible let us take a
token on their foolishness
oh well which one which one do I choose
did they make this game easier overall
with the DLC none of these monster
encounters have been very large I know
and I'm gonna be eating my hat later
just seems weird
yes this is hand of fate
come on bring it bring it
easy
a little gold to give you a taste Howard
that's a fuckload of gold only has
something to spend it on a terrifying
walk to get to the Queen so many
potential places for an assailant to get
the upper hand
it's fine ouch
it's fine
Wow very small arena
that's what he dudes
all right
to equip the current whoo are you
woodsman turned warrior now
whoa armor are you sure that's the right
of both of these things yeah rich so
little stream tonight that's why it
sucks so much this Saturday's free
chemical day that sounds great when I
get me hooks why I have to spend $50 a
month for four comic books I know this
one's not gonna be the worst one so I'll
just take it
yeah whatever
now I don't read the digital comic books
I haven't read comic books in a decade I
know that's hard for some people to
understand because Mike keeps billing me
as the comic book guy
by saying I'm not a comic-book guy I'm
saying I used to be a comic book guy but
I really don't know that you can call me
that now when I'm 10 years out of touch
with the comic book world
to frost Fang like me some frost Fang
of course defense but a valuable one
nonetheless
now what happens if I equip this I guess
I'll find out how does it deal with my
occupation does everything flip out or
is it separate I guess it's separate
which is good
yeah Civil War led directly to one more
day civil war was one of the last things
I read oddly enough
I need anything we're just good if I
gotta buy some food I don't need it I
think I'm near the end
they've got a depressing way to go out
rich probably had something doing why I
went out a treasure chest
what more iconic emblem of success could
we imagine
choose from these options
whoo I will happily wager on the outcome
I do not think you have what it takes
you're on the skull I am NOT a skull Wow
move quickly from here there is little
material gain to be made as pleases you
more gold for you and with it more
problems
oh that's right I get slowed down with
the gold middle of the road in every way
well done well we can take care of that
problem real easy
was I were that Ric Flair was part of
the WWE again now I was not I haven't
haven't paid much attention to wrestling
in a while either he's still willing but
his old age my woo was actually better
than his oh he's an old man what do you
expect Christ he's crazy enough I'm
shocked he's still not is he actually
he's not actually getting in the ring is
he it is he I doubt it but a part of me
wouldn't be too surprised
now I am buying all this food when I'm
right near the end because this
particular stage has a curse where the
more gold I have the slower I move
all right hours
Richard challenge ric flair for the
title of nature boy you know what
Ric Flair still probably kicked my ass
roses turn to Rotten enterprise you may
win this battle and send the Queen to
her rightful end yet what have you
gained in the process this token will
unlock more cards if you can defeat this
encounter in level one fictional
character King Vidya loves it when
fictional characters come on the WWF WWE
and they pretend that they're real I
think the worst offender was when the
WCW had Robocop Robocop showed up to
save sting and everyone was afraid of
Robocop even though it's clearly clearly
a man in a clunky plastic costume
know that towards her use your fucking
fries move and and miss room just miss
her completely when you do that too
we ever hit the target
all right that one much better than the
last boss fight actually the first boss
fight
inevitable I suppose and so often those
who beat ploughshare to sword I'm just
going to die their industry truer it did
he become close she for no one near
dying bravely which is all I expect from
my pawns and players
you've earned the first of the symbols
of my power and passed the first gate
there is no turning back now previously
I was merciful but now I cannot be it is
begun
I crafted each of these cards over the
course of years you have taken them from
me moments
so many tokens now so many tokens it's a
little bit insane
come play again good do you have what it
takes to defeat the rat what'd I say
this is the the best none arkham wait I
can't be part of that cuz I've got like
a little window thing could you ever the
the best game to feature an Arkham like
fighting system that isn't an Arkham
game says I eat donuts um
the fighting system itself no but the
cards and the equipment make it very
interesting
probably the best none arkham Arkham
combat shadow of mordor maybe realms of
humanity and now SWAT amongst your
cities and freakin now everyone hates
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles out of
the shadows game I'm the only one who
likes that game I thought that was a
pretty neat hybrid between an Arkham
like fighter and a regular combo fighter
cuz a little bit of both there's some
Arkham countering mixed with some
regulation combos Mad Max is far more
satisfying oh I'd have to think about
that
I think I think for the most part all of
these are combat games Phil Phil pretty
much to say for the most part
it probably seems so much easier because
you've played Dark Souls 3 and
blood-borne now but no because they're
entirely different types of combat it's
like comparing cheese to oranges doesn't
work oh no I didn't want to do the
recommended no no no get out of here
with that ship she'll die I start with a
shield now I don't need a shield think
I'm getting armor from now on out here
on out
their weapon in there
because I might accidentally get it yeah
watch her watch I'm gonna put the shield
back in this deck and I'm gonna get the
shield it's gonna happen
you what did you do for one I want all
these tokens that's what I want
damn it
anything here with Anna token I've
already unlocked something that's not a
new car
you married you
don't need you I don't need you don't
need you
you're just a father at this point good
decent equipment from that
I haven't noticed much of a difference
with the chance card event easier but
I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with it I'm
gonna stay with it
I can't read that light blue font but I
think the name is was a pretender rich
Evans voice helps me sleep at night
thank you for the backhanded compliment
rich what do you think was a better show
at its peak it's The Simpsons or
Futurama
The Simpsons The Simpsons at its peak
was fuckin awesome
our Lord both fine shows those
yeah this is obnoxious now god damn it
so much for exploring
where I get I'll take frosting I don't
need a ton of food felides are worth it
Ussuri the root of all troubles well
that's just peachy I should not do this
but I'm going to add stupid you cannot
come to this table with debts
outstanding I've wasted the so much food
on this this opening here Oh God so much
food I'm gonna regret it I know I'm
gonna regret it
useful I've got a decent amount of gold
hopefully hopefully I can find a shop
once more seeking the heart of it all
each of these cards is crafted from your
memories and built from your experience
I created them but only in the abstract
it is the importance you place on them
that makes them real there's a token in
it for you if you win
hey food game card three you'll take it
from what is my cursor what is what am i
working against
okay that's not bad
I like this demon he lies as often as he
tells the truth
do it
are you free
draw three blow again
sometimes form follows function and vice
versa in this case it's called a huge
hammer if you take a guess
win this and claim my token
hey yeah spend all of the way
I'm sure you a grateful for that well I
think of the thief movie announcement I
don't think it'll ever get made is what
I think
roaming so the video game movies have
such a great track record though
honestly what's one of those kind of
things it's hard to judge to actually
see what they're doing some kind of
trailer or screen shot or concept art or
something a leaked script
casting we're making a movie about such
and such it's not much to go on
what brings you to play the game I know
you will not tell me like all the rest
you are silent by saying I didn't like
the Prince of Persia movie it was ok but
I'm not sure if it being sarcastic but
honestly it was ok
well now rabbit trespass upon the rat
men's hunting grounds
plagued by name and delay by Nietzsche
who the rats leave behind a deadly toxic
oh I hate these motors so much
very open the chest see what it contains
I gotta get a coin from but I could get
some good loot here what goes on top
skull was on top so I don't want to pick
this right everything's good just keep
your eye on the skull keep your eye on
the skull was on top anything else other
than that what is good we're good
what are you doing an increasing effect
on taking that sort of magic with
another all you need is a channel for
power and it's simple enough artifacts
to give you powerful abilities to use in
combat
so quick to anger that's what makes them
a mob
really
yeah take half my food I got tongue
I made that a little too powerful I will
have to rebalance that next time
once the rat men begin to creep towards
the edge of the town anger follows
shortly behind
what's going on - what's going on - ha
sword is on top everything's good it's
better than trudging along a muddy road
give us more food yes right they're
greedy bastards fucking mob fucking
