can you just change the title of the
stream to stranger things boilers yeah
Supreme stranger things spoiler alert
yeah but I don't know if the title is
going to refresh as much as like if
they're in the chat they can hear us
saying we're gonna talk about spoilers
we're going to talk about spoilers for
stranger things have you better alert
it's probably better to have it on the
title of the stream they my thought yeah
your judgment I don't care it always
fine by me hmm well see that and that's
I'm not so worried about people coming
in I'm worried about like if people want
to come back do we want to set a time
after which we won't talk about spoilers
that never works okay well and it's like
I guess in here's the real thing is
usually when we start talking about
something like this it's we're just
gonna keep on talking to about it so
that's probably it for the night
if you don't want to hear anything about
strange things and we've all seen all of
it the first season so this is just
gonna be it for the night and that's all
I can say
spoilers yeah and so we just don't want
to hurt you we do we just don't want to
hurt you because it's it's a great show
and especially if you are a 30-something
who grew up watching The Goonies you're
gonna fucking love it that's all you
need to know me and et and poltergeist
and just its classic classic 80s stop
watching now and rich is gonna update
the stream title to talk to reflect that
we are now talking about stranger things
spoilers and while you're while you're
going off and and not being with us go
watch stranger things honestly take this
time even like you know what what's one
month worth of Netflix eight bucks yes
it's worth it in fact we don't have it
already you can probably get like a two
week free trial or some crap that's
that's true if you don't have Netflix
spend the eight dollars just for one
month to watch stranger things because
it's so fucking good and then if you
when you get down with strangers
go watch and break google kimmy schmitt
which we're not going to talk about
tonight but which is another call so
really good it's ocj it's now $10 but if
you get like the only one user can use
it at a time thing then I believe it's
still $7.99 because I I downgraded my
subscription to keep the same price and
and JJ it does not rip off anything it
homage is it doesn't rip off or borrow
she's really anal about that it it it
pays respect to how about that because
you can't either there's no weird
pronunciation it does not rip off or
borrow it pays respect to the things
that's trying to emulate it pays respect
to the things going to emulate so okay
that's it and spoilers this is a pretty
fucking good show everybody for coming
out we had a really great stream tonight
I got the monster or did they what what
do we talk about first with with with
stranger things references what are the
references so like obviously there's a
there's a strong Goonies vibe vibe yeah
free-range eighties kids free-range
eighties kids of course et oh yeah huge
yeah you get instead of hiding the the
alien from the mother mmm it's hiding
the girl with spooky brain powers who is
reference to firestarter no doubt and
she also he's got that then in the
quarry deprivation takes thing going on
like alt I think was altered states that
movie oh sure sure the dog looks an
awful lot like the dog from gremlins I
didn't get around looking up the dog for
meaty it might look like the dog to
meaty looks like gremlin saw he looks
like Benji he looks like where's another
movie we said that oh you'll see the dog
from The Brady Bunch which is better
earlier but boy tiger she's like 11
sorry
is like a cross between firestarter and
carry it's firestarters like
supernatural power girl wanted by the
government with carries power set yeah
yes yes good good point good good point
and it's and she's sort of et she's not
an alien she's got those powers well and
it's like the the way that they
interweave the the adult you know like
every everyone kind of has their own
storyline
right like the kids have their level
with 11 you know the group of DMD
adventurers their friend gets taken and
and in searching for their friend they
find this little lost girl then you have
the teenage storyline yeah dealing with
typical teenage stuff like in the
popular boy do I give it up do I give it
all up oh man a strength can be here so
classic look losing the virginity here
while the friend is being eaten by the
monster oh my god well and just so you
know monster that's drawn by blood well
it's where it's like but I guess here
here's where I'm going with that like
the kid line straight out of Goonies the
teenager line like straight out of her
getting killed are bowing right it's
Friday 34 movie that had teenagers but
but it's also like love triangle popular
boy II kind of stuff pretty in pink kind
of shit right and then you have the
adult storyline which is straight out of
oh my god I'm trying to remember like
the create like Kramer vs Kramer shit
you know like mothers and divorce and
and the father losing the daughter you
have all of these 80s movies tropes
smushed into one each with their own
storyline they enter to their movies
twice and the suggestion that that that
maybe hop and and the mom were together
and might get together again
right yeah beautiful he's a good kid not
like we were he's not like we were so
you know that they were drinking beer
having sex I guess like we I know we've
mentioned this I know we've mentioned
this before but how fucking good every
single child actor was every yeah every
single actor period okay
well except for the white cop with the
glasses yeah that's an honorable he's he
is the one bad actor and he's there to
be goofy background top he's busy that's
fleet fills his role he's there to be
goofy drop the backstory he's dumb hick
cop to make our hero cop seem smarter
and better sure I'm more good at his job
sure I suppose I there was a couple
things in there in the first episode
where white cop with glasses like drops
a couple like you know the sheriff's
daughter died a couple of years ago and
that's why this is so important to him
as I we don't need he's dropping some
exposition that we figured out like two
scenes later so there was just there was
a couple things with white glasses
copper I was like shut up white glasses
cop I think it should have been more
subtle or just not there at all I think
he shouldn't have said anything at all
because we he's got like two lines in
the entire show and I hated all of them
both I hate it all both of them no no
like I said specifically just that first
episode he was dropping mad exposition
that was unnecessary because we figured
it out later visually you know
oh we're taught we're talking we're
talking about we're talking about a tiny
paint chip on a super-strong chain chat
anybody who thinks monody ryder did a
bad job and has never known a frantic
mother i've seen that character in real
life I know that character yeah Wynonna
played it pitch perfect Winona Ryder was
able to hold a conversation with a ball
of Christmas lights and I believed it
and
she's played a very believable kind of
sort of semi crazy character before they
can Girl Interrupted oh sure sure I
didn't even think about that
what Odle writer is my mother after
after my sister got like lost at the
Great America wherever the fuck it was
yeah oh sure sure she she she nails it
she nails it anyone who thinks that's
over the top doesn't realize how nuts a
mother can be when the child is gone
well and and all of her over-the-topness
was set up before she was over the top
like just the way she frantically put
breakfast together for her kids or
relied on the older one to take care of
the little one and you know just the way
she carried herself before will yeah
yeah well before will was missing the
way she carried herself was was that
care a single mother whose are already
biting off more than she is she was
Harry exactly it was perfect she's
trying to she's trying to she and her
son with his job are trying to keep
together you know possibly a mortgage
and and you know a lifestyle and stuff
on a job as a cashier and he told that
he works in like fast food or something
right exactly so so it's it's just it's
just all of em and by the way like all
I'm playing the game anymore I'm just
you know I was thinking about going to
the titles I go fullscreen yeah with us
yeah sure why not yeah you know we'll
just talk about stranger things fun yeah
we're not really know someone you know
what oh fuck it let's just go go
fullscreen perfect perfect hi Marni's
look at him look at him game I mean look
at my man knees fights and they say okay
good we're gonna fall talked about but
here here's like the joy of the show
right is all that stuff about Winona
Ryder that we just talked about
character wise none of it was told to us
it was just just seeing her act
and getting those kinds of performances
out of your act average a rubbing your
knees look I hit myself you know I hit
myself two years ago you see this right
here I hit myself on my like two years
ago this has not gone away this red mark
just pointing that out so in any case to
get that kind of performance from your
actor should be something out of a
seasoned director and a seasoned
screenplay writer and this is like the
duffer brothers second big project what
was her first cuz I had never heard of
them
some fucking movie that came out last
year like that's it I don't know what
it's called Chad do you know what's
called maybe we should look it up we do
it just waste time exactly it's so I
know I'm very very pale I can't help
that what was the name hidden Thank You
Tiberius Kirk they they did this movie
last year called the hidden and that's
at J says it's very good I've never seen
it nobody saw it except for the people
at Netflix who decided to give these
guys a bunch of money and Winona Ryder
is some extra security she's gonna want
to take the outfits home just fucking
let her make sure you lock up the
cameras at night you know everyone loves
the the boys you know I mean they were
all good but no Elevens acting I mean
she's got almost no dialogue she's
carrying the whole thing with her facial
of course and it's amazing what she
liked 10 you know
oh no and like if you look up the even
all the the kid actors they've been in
like we looked it up one of the boys was
in one episode of Supernatural eight
years ago you know words there enough
Dayton was there Gatton Gaytan he was in
on Broadway and Leigh Missouri oh I
guess he's playing like a seven-year old
scab because he's like the missing teeth
but I guess that's like maybe and I
don't know if this just adds to it
because I'm a
person but knowing the performances they
got out of all those kids is so damn
impressive along with the storyline
along with the interweaving genres is so
it's just beautiful it's just a
beautiful experience I have some people
want us to talk about the CGI yeah well
I I would prefer to not have it because
I mean they're selling themselves so
hard on the nostalgia yeah I would have
liked for them to have gone all-in
budget wise I don't know how feasible
that is I know CGI is really fucking
easy I didn't think it was that really
the the only one bad CGI is the very
final all of its distracting when you're
in that 80s mindset it's all distracting
but you know every single the monster
every time but the monster the portal
yeah you could have done with the latex
the goo the goo portal coming back
together was really bad it looked bad
and they there's nothing here I'm so
fucked up and over the top they couldn't
have used some kind of practical effect
ya know they should have the goo coming
back together in the portal was
distractingly bad yes the monster I feel
like we saw so little of it most of the
time it's not even it's not even that
it's bad it's that it's distracting
within the context of hey this is just
like an 80s movie well what would you
have done instead practical the monster
in the wall would you have liked cloth
or something same way they did the alien
and aliens for the for the wall stuff
the same way they did the walls and
alien I don't remember how they did the
walls and I haven't seen that movie in
years
something physical this is something
somebody in a suit the the proud the
problem we have here is with escalation
and eventually you do need to see the
monster we see it at the end when he's
you know pushed up against the
chalkboard and he looks kind of shitty
looks acceptable the design is very
uninspired it's not terrible yeah it's
not
it's not gonna make any best movie
monsters of all time list though no no
but I but I yeah no you're right you're
absolutely right very uninspired I
thought most of the shots before that
one final scene we're done very well
where we just see it's shoulder and you
know 11 tries to touch his shoulder that
was I thought acceptable CGI you know we
see him running in the distance all
acceptable CGI the the big winner for
CGI was those fucking flakes those looks
beautiful yeah and that's all digital
yeah yeah and that looks gorgeous
yeah if you're going to do CGI though it
has to be they were like they were like
ash embers like when you know right
would ya know and just that's that was
great 3d camera tracking it they felt
natural and in that world whoever
whoever was in charge of those flakes
was on Fleck it was somebody in the chat
saying like I should have been a blob
monster was the alien to humanoid for
some kind of otherworldly bizarre
stranger thing it wasn't really strange
enough but it was it needed to be
humanoid because it was the dark side of
our own world like that upside down not
the four light years over right right
this wasn't an alien from another planet
this was you want some kind of Cthulhu S
Corp man yeah no no you you want
something that could be a human you want
something that you see in the distance
and is that a man and as you get closer
it's a monster as you get closer it
looks too much like a man do you think
that the monster was a man or is a man
in the other side in the right side up
no that it's pretty clear it's an animal
okay but their version of a man like a
twisted reflection there we say there
was a wall there would be more of them
hmm yeah I wonder like a lot more if
they're if everyone's analogous to a
human I don't see the dark side of
humanity or something weird metaphor I
don't I don't think they had a plan as
far as I was concerned but no I liked
like the introduction to him in the
in the in the deprivation tank you know
or it's just that Blackpool huh and you
do see him in a distance and you're not
quite sure what it is and I really like
that and as you get closer maybe it's a
man then we run into your very correct
analysis that it's an uninspired monster
it's just it's just a man with a with a
flappy mouth yeah fucking face mouth
Venus flytrap or some kind of mutant
vagina right of a vagina flytrap yeah
Blackpool straight out of under the skin
I've never actually seen under the skin
and I've heard it's ever great things
that Blackpool was gorgeously actually
they start out with the monster you
don't for the first episode or two you
don't even see him he unlocks the doors
and stuff but you don't see him mmm he's
good that and you look at that weird
teleportation power so cool it's so
fucking cool but nothing monster was
like this is all very nitpicky nothing
monster wise takes away from the overall
enjoyment it's the characters I had
issues with the pacing early on when I
first watched my second watch less so
for some reason there started watching
it again described pacing what do you
mean it felt like everything was
developing really slowly I thought
because they were juggling four
storylines yeah like the first four
episodes seemed like they were taking a
really long time to get to the fucking
point
oh you think oh my first watch unless
it's you my second why I really dug I I
thought it was it was a perfect slow
boil where where they gave us
interesting characters in an interesting
world and we knew what was happening and
they gave enough time they gave enough
time to set up all the characters I
really I dug the pace so okay sorry
sorry sorry not sorry you know saying
she's Sri Sri Sri not sorry sorry
stranger things what
the pacing was perfectly Spielberg and
it really was like especially like like
Close Encounters like early Spielberg
Ian where it's just that like the the
what do you call that that leads to a
stick of dynamite the fuse the fuse it
was that perfect like you know
something's happening and it's building
towards the stick of dynamite and I'm
with it I'm with it all the way like by
the way little sparks hey you thank you
anybody watching this who who has an
iPhone yeah Suri Google tentacle porn
you have to say hey Suri hey Siri Google
tentacle porn that's in your search
history now people oh that's gonna I
know I know you're in it you're in a
listener you're under listen Carly and
all guys lists of curious about all
kinds of those uh you know a lot of
people think slow is bad because I think
in a lot of cases sometimes slow means
they don't know what they're doing like
we'll just take this really slow and
then maybe figure out the ending when we
get there but it's not we've got to make
this last eight episodes well that's the
thing about this is they have they the
thing I love about Netflix shows is they
know where it's ending maybe maybe it
could have been six episodes is all I'm
saying
but what do you connect what do you cut
rich fucking nothing you got nothing
itself can we talk about like the unsung
hero of this universe which is that poor
horny science teacher he seemed to be
getting on with someone what is he's not
doing too bad for himself but what we
have in that wonderful science teacher
is a fully fleshed out character who's
just a side character right we know
exactly who that guy is and what he's
all about he chose his students over the
cute asian chick who was into horror
movies well but I'm on a date and she
seems to like the hook okay
I'll answer your science question
those kids are a dream come true for him
right kids are why you went to cow
that's very true that's why he became a
teacher yes you can tell that all and
they're all like all these reasons
they're like oh it's Friday let's get
you know like he's telling you stuff
this could be had the test blah blah
blah and all the kids are like leaving
while he's still talking and these kids
are parked right in front of his desk
did it come he well and that's like I I
feel like this is a fully realized
universe where even these minor
characters have a fully-formed visit
Hawkins exactly when there's not mothers
demons from the underside a booger x99
if you just got here we are talking
about stranger things full spoilers and
alert as the title says full stranger
thing spoilers if you haven't seen
stranger things get the fuck out and go
watch stranger things because it's the
greatest like even even the the bratty
sex-obsessed friends of the super
handsome popular guy they were such a
Shea's such clichés they were cliches
but they were solid like as characters
they were always kind of dicks they were
doing their own thing alright which is
why I actually liked that she ended up
with Steve and Steve kind of redeemed
himself a bit because it it avoided the
cliche I did expect it to go full 80s
yeah where she gets the RT photographer
nerd and the bully you know gets eaten
by the monster but fucking surprised
this century he comes back in to save
the day that's the most fun surprise
ever too when he shows up he shows up at
the door when the the other two are
confronting the monster they're waiting
for the monster to show up they have
just cut their hands so the blood would
lure the monster in and Steve comes to
the door he's actually looking to
apologize he took down the the spray
paint from the sign he is now agrees
he's realized that he's a good guy
fucking beautiful then he sees Nancy's
cut he said did he cut you nikoline he's
trying to be the hero
and like get out of here he's like but I
wanna pocket
what's what's what's what's the nerdy
guys name was Joshua or J something
loves his name I can't remember his
fucking name
oh the photographer photographer the
older brother I can reverse name but
their him in the Nancy they're all
they're like in a battle mode they're
all Jonna Jonathan
they're completely like ready to fight
the monster you know and Steve's just
like what he was a character no idea
what was going on the whole time why is
there a bear trap in your hallway house
when I'm not there well and it's just
like that's that's another thing with
like the different storylines like the
different levels of preparedness
everyone is to fight the monster the
teenagers they have they have baseball
bats a gun like a bear trap there is a
baseball bat it's a homemade mace that's
how the thing didn't split it was not a
bit of one of those new Ashe fans
provocation and then like the adults are
going full like working with the man
explore a like if you think about it
right the adults sold out oh yeah about
to the man made me hate the sheriff well
maybe he hopper
well yeah he's mad at hopper because he
told that veces that hopper sold out 11
but yeah I know I know that the adults
were going to nod smile and put her in
foster care at which point they were
gonna you know well and like that's the
thing about hopper and you know what it
makes sense like did what he had to do I
get it like it also in that last episode
it is constantly flashing back to hopper
and his daughter who died of cancer we
assume yeah and he didn't save her it
makes it so apparent that he's like he
understands that xi is not gonna die if
she goes back to the to the thing he
needs to save a kid even at the cost of
another kid like his motivation is so
fucking clear what's the save Winona
from what he has experience exactly like
I just need to save a child
Elevens not gonna die she might be
Prison will worry about 11:00 later we
need to save a child because I know what
that's like exactly it was like
character-wise it wasn't satisfying
it wasn't full-on 80s ending which is uh
everyone wins and everybody has a great
time but everyone doesn't win in real
life exactly exactly which which I like
the ending of the show with the the
bully redeeming himself yeah they
managed to avoid complete cliche like
even though even the kids at the end
with the slingshot and like a 80s kids
movie which i think was like kind of a
kind of an homage to the gate where the
kids got like the the the the homemade
rocket you know this thing goes up a
hundred feet with I don't know carbon
dioxide or something or pure love but in
the in the in the eighties kids movie
you know that last the last slingshot
pellet would have hit it in the magical
vulnerable weak spot called the monster
to use the end kids inhaler against it
is not that a slingshot is a perfect
weapon it's that in these 80s movies
it's a symbolic weapon right right and
and had it gone full 80s that last shot
would have been the magic rock that the
power of friends yeah and they just
subverted the expectations enough to
elevate it somewhat someone was asking
do you think that the Nancy Jonathan
trap was a case of the giving them
something to do yeah that that storyline
has no payoff Nancy and Jonathan
confront the monster yes they burn the
monster and it runs wait it's fine
it they have no effect on the outcome
nothing they do is a net positive it's
just a waste of time
well it's unknowable I mean maybe they
delayed the monster just enough no all
the other kids also they they district
like unknowing to them they distracted
the monster so the cop and Wynonna could
go to the kid exactly and that was it
presumably that's not clear enough it's
pretty clear a pretty fucking clear yeah
the month there's in this universe there
is only one monster or in this town
there
only one monster and they are
distracting it very clear the the real
question is is is them confronting the
monster their payoff yeah oh it's a good
payoff for their characters I'm just
saying ultimately but will any well
that's everybody the whole town together
everybody played a role in defeating the
monster right 11 finish it off no it
takes a village but also it doesn't
matter it it's moot whether or not they
affected the outcome of the monster fate
is Dustin huh they said it was a list
kid it doesn't matter who actually has
that disease you're right yeah that's
right
it does not matter whether they affected
the outcome of the monster they got to
the end of their art which was them
confronting them ah see that's the
important part it wasn't so like them
setting up their trap being prepared
being willing to fight was the end of
their character arc so it wasn't a case
of the giving them some things to do 'z
it was the logical conclusion to their
character arcs okay okay you may be
right where they didn't make it super
clear that they were distracting the
monster I thought it was clear because
they were noticing that didn't want the
people in the upside down noticing what
was going on with the monster that was
happening to him up there like they saw
like the bird thing or they saw somebody
burn immerse that's right and then they
followed the monsters track backs back
to its lair because it was hurt and so
like I know but but you're right okay
it's not satisfies this fucking Christ
all right I get it
well you know get it I get where you're
coming from where it's not satisfying
because they didn't know that they were
helping yeah yeah but for their
characters that was it that's all that
mattered just like for the kids like the
kids did fucking nothing
sorry who's gonna go fine we're gonna go
find this this monster and defeated by
writing a
our little dirt but exactly but this leg
shot but that's the conclusion for there
Karen see that it's it's three different
movies
that's three very different movies yeah
things absolutely absent again three
movies but it's the kids movie yeah it's
the the teenagers fighting a monster
movie and then it's the the the adults
finding a lost kid who's being hunted by
a monster movie right all and and all
storylines have a very unique and
specific tone like especially in the in
the last year episodes where the adults
are just slowly walking through the what
is it called the under the upside down
the upside there just slowly walking
through the upside is so like abyss
right and it's it's very the thing where
it's like it's it's horror its suspense
and then you have the the kids who are
you know cracking jokes and fight
running away from the military boys it's
very easy and then you have the
teenagers being super badass I really
like its John Hughes directs Friday the
13th or yeah or carry or yes very carry
to the other one was the other Christine
yes and so like you have these different
I think I talked about this earlier
about all the actors in this Eve
striking a different chord and coming
together in a nice harmony you have the
same thing with the storylines all nice
what do you call it when you have
affectionate feelings toward something
in the past it's nostalgia harmony thank
you both of you both of you film the
words in my head
jet saying Matthew B Dean was fucking
great he was great it was a very easy
paycheck for Matthew Modine he was great
the white haired guy the bad guy he was
great and Sally started talking not not
because he's a bad actor I just loved
his character not saying anything for
the first five episodes they didn't need
him for very many days you could tell
him but he was great yeah he was great
he was great as the ominous bad guy
military scientists what's your favorite
moment of the movie of the show of the
show basically I was basically movie
right oh my god
I think my favorite is is when Wynonna
after she's already wrong up all those
random items she just has a bunch of
Christmas lights she goes and she's like
looks all crazy and she's like just ring
me up no we've already been through this
you're gonna do it to do it yeah we
already both agree that you think I'm
crazy ring me up I kind of like her here
alone with though when she runs back
inside well walks back inside the house
yeah after the monster attack and she
hears the song you know will you stay
will you go down of course
she makes it she makes that should I go
yeah I will stay yeah I should stay yeah
she sees like the thing pushing through
the wall so she runs out the house but
but that like that's her defining
character later on great ship oh that's
great that's great yeah I mean like for
me I'm again thinking about like her
slow not it not like the the slow reveal
that she's not crazy because we all know
she's not crazy the audience knows he's
not crazy but she is riding that line
between em icings in my head or am i
helping my son and finally finally six
episodes in the sheriff Hooper comes in
and tells her she's not crazy that was
so cathartic for me like just someone
tell Wynonna cuz like the little boys
know right the little boys know there's
a monster the teenager and the son know
that there's not there's a monster at
that point but no one told Wynonna I
kind of like Hooper just slowly figuring
out that something very real is going on
hopper hopper what am I saying I said
Hooper it's contagious dad I'm sorry
what finally nailed it for him oh yeah
see like he's about to stab the corpse
that's right here it's not just seeing
the cut he had to make that decision at
the punch on one out
yeah he's like well you know some great
detective stuff going on but he's a
great detective yeah right
again that's the adult storyline it's
it's a detective story it's just three
different movies interwove
into a scarf of nostalgia but I mean
yeah I was I was just so happy when I
know it out epic Jason X 9000 says that
hole I'm not crazy plot line a so
overdone and cliched it is done so well
though
I can't think of what has been done
better it doesn't the the hole lit
literally the entire premise of this is
nothing but a series of cliches the the
little girl who is everything all of the
basic stories have been done yes and and
this is an amalgamation of all the
cliches done perfectly so it doesn't
matter if they're cliches even got the
girl from poltergeist /et right
everything they have everything you've
ever seen in any 80s kids movie or
teenage drama or adult suspense thriller
is in this and done incredibly well in
the sets are so densely packed with
bric-a-brac from from the period how
often did you find yourself looking for
mistakes often yeah often both in terms
of the dialogue and in terms of the
background like what the movies are
talking about what your what your two
poltergeist comes takes place in 93
poltergeist was was at 82 I might have
an 82 all right all right there right
there right on poltergeist exactly that
would have been too much and they knew
that yeah knew that that's that's right
Wynonna talking to a tangle of Christmas
lights had more emotion to it than any
recent movie I I can remember just just
that realization that so and then you
know she paints the letters and oh and I
love the part where you know we were I
don't you know that everybody thinks
she's crazy even though she's about to
use an axe to put a hole in the front
wall of her house my kids in the wall
that that whole thing by the way how
they can sometimes come through but then
you can't go through was was so well
done yeah and then like the little gooey
hole in the tree that Nancy has to crawl
through fucking love that
love that that was that was straight out
it was so dumb for that what she was so
fucking dumb
I don't care I mean you know what
teenagers in these movies make dumb
mistakes
I loved it that was something right out
of like legend you know or Dark Crystal
just walking through a gooey tree hole
two mistakes have found them oh you
found you know buddies things nobody
ever said douchebag back then nobody
ever fuckin said that I don't know I
mean we were too young to know that word
Nancy calls Mike a douchebag at the
dinner table yeah yeah somebody else
says it later to douche bag and mouth
breather that's one I don't remember
anybody using bad yo that's right he
calls the bullion mouth breather yes I
mean and that may be true but then again
I mean people might have been using
their word those people just weren't you
because in that time period you were
just a little kid
I was no stranger to our rated films
this is true so what happened with the
phone that was will right well yeah what
we learned is when they're in the upside
down literally them just walking in the
negative space causes electrical surges
yep and so if will was in the negative
space near the phone his thoughts would
have been transmitted thoroughly because
I got the impression that maybe some of
the items of the real because like like
the like the treehouse thing or you know
the coppiced
lean-to or whatever the heck the console
will or castle by oh yeah yeah I that I
that they either could manifest it in
their mind or different elements of the
real world would be visible to the
people in the underground so I think
will may have been picking up a phone
I'm usually may have had of you know I
mean house would he know that there were
letters in which light to light up oh
well oh I think ever everything is a
reflection like so as soon as Wynonna
put up the lights
he sees the lights but did he see the
floating paintbrush or maybe that's
probably but like yeah the question is
did he try to pick up the phone or was
he just me
the phone and his thoughts came through
his electricity yeah
negative space isn't that a few blocks
from the Phantom Zone or the shadow
realm or out what all of those will kind
8 of cliches will conscious and
wandering it or was he unconscious
dreaming it in a little ball and his
imaginary Castle buyers hiding the whole
time sure sure
I'd like to think of it as an actual
like the upside of being a physical
space so he had to run to his fort and
that's how it seemed to work yeah and
the monster wasn't going after him
because it was eating you know it ate
the deer so it was fine at a barb
r.i.p barb so it was fine you know so it
wasn't necessarily interested in hunting
him because it was getting food
somewhere else until the end when yeah
when the story said you have to hunt
well no so is 11 dead is 11 is 11
no is 11 incorporeal permanently
that's the question and when hopper puts
the Eggos in a little thing in the woods
yeah does he know something or is that
just him like doing that as a memorial
what guilty conscious gotta think oh he
knows he's so so you know he makes the
deal with with the government at the end
to give him 11 and he gives the full
report to the government so the
government knows something's up the chat
Chad loves 11 by the way I'm with you
I'm because I love this discussion time
do you think barb will be back is some
kind of undead thing her possessed
something around should look normal but
she won't be do you think the will will
turn dark if it's just her like her face
sticking out of the side if some kind of
inhuman beast let it be fine - that
would be awesome
no so like we can only assume that 11 is
somewhere in the upside down as
something right uh-huh
I don't think they're done with her I
don't think it just like Oh 11 is gone
Oh also like just with the popularity of
this that depends upon how they handle
the follow-up right well I think they've
already said that the follow-up will
contain the same cast okay it's not
going to
anthology where every season is
different so we will pick up next season
later on with this story well I think
you know it would be a shame to get rid
of the cat Yeah right
especially like 11 and Dustin and hopper
and Winona Ryder and people love these
characters oh absolutely I think they're
great no so hopper made a deal hopper
knows she's alive the question is
whether or not the government know she's
still in that who knows well they took
him they put him in the car near the end
ya know yeah he made a deal he's he's
repping heaven yep he's working with him
the lane of the upside-down
what's the lane movie called the lane
I don't know 11 will become the lane of
the upside-down no idea we're not
familiar with the new cast plus new
character no I think they've already
they've already said that yeah you hear
multiple things you don't know for sure
no something official is revised why
would you not with something that has
been this wildly popular even if it ends
up sucking why would you not make a
follow up and encourage the Netflix
subscriptions
oh sorry say Lando sexier same
characters plus new characters yes yeah
that's that's usually how it works but
do we see your ballsack that's the
important part that's daddy you're right
that is the important part no and so you
know like where we're where will hopper
story take them is he working with them
is the double agent is he just being
cool with them like do dead people go
into the upside down can his daughter be
brought back oh my god oh gosh you're
gonna get biblical with it no no I'm
just suggesting that that is the is the
underworld
I guess these people are here physically
but I'm just wondering if this is like
you know some kind of metaphor for Hell
or something I don't know sure well his
daughter come back in some fashion or
what well they taunt him with images of
his daughter or or you know attempt to
tempt him with simulacra of her to make
him be evil
I'm sure I'm sure at one point one of
the boys told hopper that 11 really
liked tangos yes I'm sure they they all
talked afterwards they never spoke again
they never that weird adventure they
were all on together did the boys like
cuss him out afterwards a cute print
he's like LSD her kryptonite if you give
her some or she loses her powers whoa
no I like to me the only the only
question that needs answering is what
the fuck is that slug thing that came
out of will and one rich commented that
it was coming out of Barbara's mouth too
that's right yeah she dad her just
sleeping
she seemed - she seemed like maybe they
were using the bodies to incubate
something yeah that was fucking grow and
I did not see that coming did not see
that going it was great
we'll probably get some black goo in him
yeah yeah could be like that that one
kind of tilts her head sideways when she
breaks bones reminds me of Samantha from
bewitches know her again just really
good directing like she's physically
when she snaps someone's neck you know
she's a little it's great her guts were
coming out that's pretty dead yeah but I
deliver the actual image again
Barb's dead Barb's definitely been eggs
I have eggs oh oh you think they're eggs
yeah Bert oh yeah yeah and that's I
thought they might have been some kind
of eggs or larvae coming out of will and
Barbara but I hard to say it's weird
deliberately weird and where did they go
after they still really weird and
deliberately ambiguous yeah yeah well
we'll see what how I'm super fucking
excited we're probably not gonna get it
until like two years from now because
that's how Netflix works there's that
one this is it two years between shows
on Netflix oh I have no I think Bo
Jackson like I want to ride this wave a
little bit
oh well I mean they'll probably make a
big announcement and then you know slow
the relief trailers like but you know
both Daredevil and Jessica Jones were
huge hits
daredevil came out so quick there was a
year I'm just saying that's got two
years that's not two years you're just
saying if you get people on board
because they've heard about this and
they subscribe to Netflix and watch the
eight episodes and cancel it you know
I'm having really realized counters and
no agenda right every character is a
fully realized character regardless of
gender stream dropped stream drop that's
weird
we must be having hello we're back we're
back we're back we must be having very
strange internet we were having storms
earlier today so what if that's
affecting our internet it's not OBS
where everything on our end is showing
up fine yeah could beat which could be
switched servers we didn't have to wait
a beer oh you didn't have to wait a year
for us to come back no but I know they
they just announced Netflix just said
that they're waiting they're not gonna
even shoot new seasons of Jessica Jones
or daredevil that's a Marvel thing that
a Netflix thing and sarva laughter Luke
Cage and iron fist and defenders Marvel
for some reason that sounds odd and
potentially suspicious yeah saying only
two shows a year Jack you're like not on
camera oh well I think I am I think I'm
kind of off like this good I want to
talk to Rachel but no I we don't have to
look at each other to talk to each other
like I could talk to rich like this and
really talk to the camera but that's
weird for me I think the question is why
would Marvel want to limit them to two
shows two different shows a year well
I'm sure they're trying to preserve
budget you know like keep a higher
budget to make quality and there don't
they
like the TV show division they're all
about the film they do not like agents
of shield don't Sonny well but the
Netflix shows have been prop popular
there so they're probably trying to
preserve budget and prevent
oversaturation like haven't they've been
reluctant to have movie shutting like
movie stuff show up and like the dare to
have a little kind of Netflix universe
yeah yeah it's it's it's not it's not
separated but it's just one of those
unspoken things this this could be like
a crybaby ish kind of thing that's how I
read it
you know well two shows a year
yeah could be I don't know it's a shame
because the shows they're not bombing
you think you two shows in here yeah
yeah no you guys do your you guys do
your little your little TV show thing
that's fine you want you want a star
from one of the movies well how about
how about the the girl in the Thor movie
that's who agents of shield gotten as a
big crossover is you know the girl that
fights with Thor and Thor she came to
agents of shield once that was their big
star
it's a shame stomp you know it's I kind
of get it where you know they want to
keep the big movies big and they don't
want to they don't want to intermingle
to to over fact that goes against the
strengths of their whole shared universe
business though SIF that's right the SIF
lady SIF the female warrior in Thor came
on for an episode of agents of shield
was actually twice Oh was it twice shit
shit I don't care oh yeah no that's
right they did get Nick Fury for like 30
seconds of screen time to network TV is
deader than barb Oh horrible glory gets
it it's true it's true but Netflix ain't
did Netflix ain't did TV finds ways to
make itself more and more and more
unpleasant to watch it's really true
here's 47 commercials and not only that
it's the same 47 every commercial break
sometimes the same commercial twice in
the same commercial break right right so
you're going not this again our Miller
is asking that same question again which
makes me think your home rent let's cut
off oh yeah yeah how about the fact that
Miller says how about the fact that
stranger things put girl power in the
movie subtly and much better than a
certain remake that came out this year
said that well I think maybe the thing
they got cut off though you got
disconnect and what I said is it one
they don't put girl power in subtly -
it's not about girl power in stranger
things every single character is a fully
realized person good
females males children dogs yeah the
fucking pancakes were fully realized
pancakes they're just writing good
characters they're not pushing any kind
of agenda and we haven't we have Nancy
who's going on her you know like maybe
maybe in their head they say oh you know
what we want a female character to go on
a journey so we have Nancy who's going
on her own character journey she happens
to be a fully realized character she's
not that strong yeah she's not perfect
she's just a character who tries to do
her own shit
like she's not she's not furiosa for
Christ's sake she's not beating up
anybody she's failing quite a bit mm-hmm
and that's kind of what makes her great
men punching people isn't the only way
people get shit done in this movie right
you don't have to be strong physically
to be a strong character you can just
you know do the shit that you want to do
yeah yeah the bully character oh I like
the bully care well oh you mean like the
child bully characters well those were
just you know what they had those
characters go a bit too far for me when
he pulled out the knife it's like come
on they pulled out the knife on Mike
with a Corey oh yeah they tried to get
him to walk off of the cliff to his
death hmm that wasn't really sad that
wasn't realistic
and he was kind of a prey it was a prick
but he wasn't homicidal bull he's
usually aren't homicidal he wasn't
homicidal budges jerks but he's also a
kid how I read that situation was he was
he was a kid and he wasn't aware that
falling there would kill someone but
then like when that was brought up and I
think that was brought up in that scene
it's another kid really he's gonna die
you could see it on the kids face that
he was like rethinking his actions might
not be right that's just how I read it
but hey he was a prick let it be a prick
says this is a dickhead kid good bully
you want that I was glad he wet his
pants good bully fodder hi were Dustin
yeah after they had the night to a show
throat after that after they're standing
at the edge watching Mike levitate up
and they're distracted yeah I shove them
over after that shit no it does put a
knife to my throat here you go bitch
yeah well even it didn't have it to his
throat really he was threatening to take
his teeth out true Brian wasn't that a
Goonies reference kids and eighty movies
were homicidal and did shit like that's
just him being a kid and not knowing it
yeah that's right that's right speed
gear says he actually said something
like holy shit he actually did it like
when when he goes over there is that
moment of realization like you just beat
a brick now do you think the bully's
sidekick will join Team Dustin Mike no
problem no we're probably not gonna see
them again except for in passing no and
you know obviously there are some
cliches like those bullies like the the
horny couple who are also bullies and a
teenage storyline rich wouldn't you beat
him with the butt of a rifle look
sometimes what an opportunity comes up
it's just too good to pass up when are
you gonna get an opportunity to shove
somebody off the edge of a quarry you
have to take that chance when it comes
so that you can end up in prison he
slipped idiots idiots slipped he pulled
the knife out on us and when he was so
raving he just he fell like that was
terrible I believe it happened he's
gonna be he's gonna end up in juvenile
oh oh my handprint was on him but cuz I
tried to grab him to pull back kids are
gonna crack when they interview them all
and say what happened no see yeah you
don't you don't push them off what you
do is you know that that was 11 but all
of a sudden you know you see Mike
levitating then you go like this you go
huh and make the bully thing that you're
doing that the bully and start doing
this and then hoping you have
superpowers
that's what you do man where would this
ranked on TV shows for this year plus
what else came out yeah you're fucking
the best thing ever I don't know I
cannot think of another show I've been
this excited about did Jessica Jones
come out this year was that last year
I'll say this year more than the last
this
better than Jessica Jones in the last 12
months okay daredevil season 2 as well
oh yeah this is better than that this is
way better than man I never actually
finished watching daredevil season 2 you
really should know I know I should
because I think you you need I got
distracted I'm sorry watch them else in
there I'm bothered come back now
now that I hated what I saw either just
great right I grew up near Thornton
quarry so more often than you think
oh people slip in the quarry more often
than we think oh I grew up near that too
big ol hole in the ground they just
closed that recently Fargo sees nothing
about this year had uneasy feeling in my
stomach whenever I drove over the quarry
the bridge I think I think this is
better than Fargo season 2 pathways
stranger things is better than Fargo
season 2 maybe not better than Fargo
season 1 that's what I'll say about
stranger things but also stranger things
is 8 episodes and so they really got to
distill that story perfectly into 8
episodes you know long garm omelly says
yeah all of the TV shows you guys are
talking about aren't actually on TV
welcome to the Future dip ship bang I
might say this is better than ash vs.
Evil Dead this is better than aspirin I
love that vs. Evil Dead this is way
better than ash where's everything
stranger stranger Fargo season 1 is
greater I think quite has it here Fargo
season 1 is the greatest then stranger
things then Fargo season 2 quietest
