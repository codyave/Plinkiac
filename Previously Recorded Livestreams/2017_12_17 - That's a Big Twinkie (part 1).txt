fuckers talking over it so fuck it we
had I'm running late and it's my fault

technical problems it was me it's my
fault that we're late
you need the controller I don't know how
the game works I don't know what's going
on oh yeah that I don't know so it's my
it's my fault we're running late
technically speaking it was some asshole
one-year-olds fault
who just took his sweet-ass time eating
his birthday cake so the rest of us
couldn't have someone get the hell out
of there you know I'm saying can't you
just say I got a go no it's just one of
those things where you know like it I

first and he's just so adorable
eating cake is one year old that we all
got to wait now until he's done eating
his cake before we get cakes I have to
go to work well it was just one it was
it was a death by a thousand cuts you
know where it's just like I was just a
couple more minutes just a couple more
minutes until were late that was the
problem for anyone wondering we will not
be talking about the last Jedi even a
little bit I don't even I haven't seen
it yet rich has and I don't even want
rich to give me vague impressions I have
stayed completely away from really all
criticism of it even I like I haven't
heard
anything good bad or otherwise snape
kill dumbledore no first of all Snape is
in this movie
what well technically it's a CGI Snape
that's great so no there will be no last
rat I talk and I and it's its opening
weekend so in chat no last chat I talk
we don't want any spoilers spoilers will
be dealt with by the mod team even joke
spoilers because at this point we don't
know what a spoiler is for those who
have not seen it so please please dear
Christ's God Almighty Lord
Jack means fucking business please for
the love of God stay away man stay away
Ferdinand spoilers that's fine you spoil
all the Ferdinand I don't even like Star
Wars why do you care about my rich they
just like to hear you talk man I just
and this gives you something to talk
about for an extended period of time
some day yeah some day Oh we'll talk
well I'm I'm planning on seeing it
sometime this week I mean I mean you
know what this one I'm not gonna take
the kids to that's probably good call
yeah I am well and here it's not because
I think it's inappropriate because I
mean I don't know anything about it but
like you know what I sometimes I just
want to see a fucking movie by myself so
I'm just gonna see it during the day
like a morning show one day this one and
smashed furniture broken chandeliers
destroyed paintings shattered bases so
half in the bag is dropping during
extreme as is tradition yes
it would not surprise me if anything not
necessarily I like seeing movies along I
mean you know it's always fun you know
like if you go with a group and usually
the people that I go to see movies with
aren't obnoxious assholes so it's it
hasn't been that big of a problem but I
will tell you this as a parent yeah even
if your kid is good in the movie theater
which mine are I have trained them to be
good in movie theaters oh there's always
that like little part of your brain that
is like listening to them and if they
need anything if they you know like all
of a sudden if there's a bathroom issue
if there's you know a food issue of it
there's a spill like there's just a tiny
part of your brain the thing is into the
kid so wait a minute wait are those
ghosts super ghost story is what like
echoes they're not even a ghost I
recommend you I'm gonna go to a morning
show I'm gonna go to a morning show
during the week I'm not worried about
getting tickets for that let's start
there am I feeling better yes I'll
probably still sound a little throaty
today I head up just this awful awful
sore throats on on Wednesday thank you
by the way rich force almost drew me on
Wednesday really appreciate I guess
comments people seem to like that stream
even though I like hardly said anything
well and I know you picked this game
because you know it's very dialogue
heavy it was a smart call can we take
the stairs well whoever suggested where
were actually suggested it was a great
idea
great idea
or something so so yeah it was just my
throat was all sore it was it was awful
but it's clearing up now and you know
the other thing I was worried about of
course was getting you sick oh yeah I
appreciate that and and you know just
like us trapped in a room for hours
alone knowing that you know like there's
stuff that you were going to have to
record later it was you know but let's
just get rich Evan sick I don't know
have you been playing okami at all
everything I know I downloaded it today
I kind of remember rich
I kind of remember oh shit I got a play
Oh calm even a waggle my finger are you
all the dog I want to talk about that
next week
I know I know this upcoming week it is
next week already
I love time I love time
oh let's see what we have here why would
you even ask that
Jaka what's your favorite pokemon ridge
since you aren't into Pokemon who is
your favorite recently outed sexual
harasser don't know like lame from
talking about Pokemon story sexual
harassment yeah it's you know who is
your favorite Pokemon oh uh you know who
I always enjoyed from the original
series is magic magic carpets that's my
favorite recently revealed sexual
harasser how funny yeah I always liked
the bit for Magikarp is Magikarp is an
utterly useless Pokemon week and you
have a chance to buy him very early on
in the game for a large amount of
ridiculous and by Pokemon in the game as
well he's like he's like one of the few
worthy only in the original game that
you can just buy okay but he's useless
he can't attack he has no attack and he
can't defend and he's weak and he's
nothing he's a nothing Pokemon gym but
if you can train him which is a really
difficult task
eventually he turns into a giant
kick-ass dragon okay but he starts off
as an utterly useless poker - that's
adorable
he's a fish that's right so I always
liked that bit of magic part of him just
being useless and with your grit
determination and and stubborn will you
could turn him into a fighting machine
so he's completely useless until the
very end like and or any of his
intermediary stages useful no no as as
Magikarp he is nothing and you have into
what you only have the one evolution it
has the one evolution okay and so as
Magikarp what you have to do is toss him
into a battle and then bring him out and
toss another pokemon in so he shares
experience points which is really
difficult and time-consuming and can
hurt your other Pokemon and so it's it's
how do you train it if you can't win a
battle that's how you do it you have to
get him to share the experience by
tossing them into battle bringing him
back out than tossing a new Pokemon it
to finish the battle can you grind the
early areas you can you could grind
their early areas but that would take
even longer so
anyway I always so I he was he was
always my favorite sure he can tackle at
level 15 but it's your nothing he's so
weak it doesn't do anything but let's
see here um do be sandwich says question
Ricardo yeah and also Harlan can a
single character good or interesting
really be enough to invest in a TV show
movie or book house yes any medium in
general Evil Dead notwithstanding well
you can't give an example of a movie
with one really good character and just
say that doesn't count as a movie with
one really good that's okay I got I got
you a second one anyway huh boom that's
a great example I mean really any of
those detective shows right and like
look at something like monk or psyche or
Columbo like Columbo is a detective
story where you know who done it but
you're just so fuckin into Columbo that
it doesn't matter that's what that's
what entire shows are built on is just
good characters even just one good kick
you say do you mean
Kellogg's crumb flakes we can talk about
the uncanny valley that is Attila battle
angel have you seen that trailer no I
think so it's a it's a seems to be a
live-action movie and it might be based
off of an anime okay but the Tiwi of the
battle angel is is a fully CG character
but other people are real human mess
does she look anime she looks a little
anime does she look human she's she's CG
but like are they going for realistic or
does she look like an anime character
we'll see that's the interesting part is
because she's supposed to be kind of a
robot they they Anna made up a person
yeah and so actually I I kind of liked
the way she looked and I'm hoping that
because she's CG it's actually kind of a
meta commentary on what I think the plot
of the movie is so it could be
interesting that has to end up looking
creepy right there's no way that doesn't
look creepy oh it does no and it does
look creepy but I think that's
purposeful like I think the uh they're
using the uncanny valley to the
advantage of storytelling where she's
not quite human but almost human that's
what I assume so that's what I assume is
like because she doesn't really look
human they're hope they're using that as
a commentary
I thought the trailer looked really cool
I'll be honest with you look like
they're gonna have some neat action
stuff and action stuff that they can get
away with because she's already CG
pardon me
good theory but Rodrigo isn't that smart
I don't know you know he's old school
you might be able to it you might be
able to pull it out Jennifer Connor
that's right Thank You chef for
reminding me riches now going to that
way you get my interest and she's not
just a voice she's in it yeah
so I don't know I think we're having the
trailer look meat I think relocate yeah
put that down on my list but there's so
many things on my list now that if
getting is getting a little ridiculous
which is mine movies I need to see a
list
it's just kidding it's getting
overwhelming
hey how about that atrocious trailer for
alpha I don't know if I saw that I don't
even know what alpha is sorry
that's a cool design for it ghosts but
it's not leaving them
the chef ghosts like its arm its arms
aren't moving those things I believe
looks like a still image of hooks that's
moving me off I was like man and volt or
something I don't know
schemers need it looks same it looks
like everything one ghostbusters fan
would want you get to be a Ghostbuster
right have you seen Jack trigger choices
that's what I was just thinking well
with my with my movies I need to see I
have never seen looper no that's the one
that Ryan Jensen he that's the movie he
did before the star doors and I have
heard nothing but good things about
people and I like Bruce Willis and I
even like that Joseph gordon-levitt and
it seems like a really neat sci-fi
premise and I haven't seen brick it's a
it's a Joseph gordon-levitt
it's a high school noir detective movie
set in modern-day Los Angeles cute I've
heard good things and uh there's another
movie the brothers I was it called the
brothers Briggs be the boo-boos but
nice cat the Brothers Bloom that's what
it's called
and I remember way back in the day area
no way back when I heard that rain
Johnson was joking Star Wars they
reminded me to see me oh yeah gotta get
looper back up on my list of Newtons to
see it I never got so I've gotten better
at this game that kitchen level used to
kill me constantly oh yeah
now do you get to choose which
Ghostbuster you are you're the rookie oh
oh it's basically so you can just sit
back and watch the other guys when they
do their thing
gotcha gotcha so you do not play as no
as one of V good you're you're the new
guy that hired a test on all the
experimental weapons that might blow up
on your back
that's great you don't they don't treat
you with much respect that's perfect so
yeah one of these days I'll get around
to blooper I'll get her onto everything
one of these days checks out here
what are you guys doing what are you
guys doing it's waiting they're waiting
for you rookie Rookie

spoilers oh yeah whoo go back and go
back to the start of the stream
what's wrong with the sorry if it was
freaking out before but it seems to be
fine now top above Jack no it's I don't
see anything I don't know what you're
doing Jack has a black triangle above
his head he doesn't what are you talking
about I click on just another side see
how it's on cam link so we can see the
frame just click on something else oh no
you can turn to keep the game on what do
you mean click on something else see how
the yeah oh oh there oh yeah oh this
must have fallen off of the thing under
there oh okay see so we have like this
frame that's around and we actually
could not there was a white border
around the little screen for our camera
that was actually blocking that really
weird really weird I'm gonna I'm gonna
get the game back on you get the game
back home it's off its thing all right
all right there we go
there we go I fixed it
also did I fix it yep totally fix it
it's on a little wedge alright so what
am I missing
turn down the generator and the guys
will stop you why did they stop here
back on its thing
the our green screen is a is a piece of
plywood that we have painted green it is
it is uh it is a just a big hunk of wood
that is sitting on top of two smaller
hunks of wool but the difference egon
and it fell off of one of its hunks of
wood how did you find out exist I don't
remember
I don't either I didn't care I just like
psych-out my presence I didn't give a
shit you've been leaving Santa my anger
whatever
yeah sure he's there yeah and I didn't
think about it I didn't care as long as
I got up on Christmas in their presence
that was all that mattered that was the
thing where like I I want to I want to
say like you know so you know it's
actually it's actually me who brings
your present I ain't saying that I
actually claim to believe in Santa years
after I did because I did not want to
kill the Golden Goose
ah right wait a minute
ice if I tell if I tell them I don't
believe in Santa does that mean I get
presents oh yeah I believe in Santa
Santa come yet oh I was a fraud god I
don't know gotta there
yeah so no I but I don't know the
specific time I also like you know I
have a younger brother and so I had to
keep up the facade a little bit longer
yeah you know which was and I think it's
fun like yeah if you find out yeah just
don't spoil it you know I think that was
actually actually I think I remember
that is okay you're right Santa's not
real but if I find out that you told
your little brother that Santa's not
real no presents for you and I was like
fuck it then I'm in I'm on it yeah I
mean on the bit Santa's real oh yeah
reindeer all that shit I'm in on him
fraud fraud no no that's that's a payoff
rich I got paid off I I was a I was
bought by big Santa would anyone
recommend this game I would catching
ghosts is fun and if you're a fan of the
movies hearing the original actors do
their characters again is it's an insane
nostalgia trip I've heard this is you
know kind of the unofficial ghost as
he's three you know yeah so why not so
why not that's not a payoff Jack that's
extortion but I was being extorted I
mean why do we keep seeing new ghosts I
was beat no I was being paid in presence
to keep as a secret I will say this
though I had to break it to my little
brother my parents didn't want to have
her sock so that was a little bullshit
like I was just like I had that
responsibility you had what you had to
tell him yeah that shouldn't be a
responsibility for a second he's gonna
figure out his own no I remember
specifically like it was my mom who was
like you have to
Oh cuz I think he was asking questions
like I think he was at that
for some reason it was wasted on
something I don't know why exactly so
you're his mother you do it bitch yes
that's exactly how I talk to my mother
who would then abruptly and thoroughly
kick my ass did I have to tell him yeah
that's a weird thing I had to save
Christmas one year you're the save her
save Christmas one how did you save
Christmas
my mother was buying a dog I knew about
it
that wasn't Christmas president and I
don't know what the fuck she was
thinking she bought the dog at like a
mall that I had a pet store when the
rest of the family was with and somehow
they got that I don't I don't remember
the details but the ID was in the car
and my siblings did not see the dog put
in the car or in the car on the way home
from the mall and this dog lays like
this like day before Christmas Eve or
Christmas Eve it wasn't far before
Christmas and this dog started barking
and just thinking as quickly as I could
just extremely loudly I just that's

New Year's when does Christmas fall oh
it's like it's like kind of Monday or
Tuesday it's like on a Monday or Tuesday
do you have any conflicts yes several I
will tell you I'm gonna look at the
calendar rate this very near look at the

bug so we should be good we should be
good for Wednesday should sunday is
Christmas Eve
Oh so even Sunday's kind of fucked then
Monday's Christmas and then Wednesday I
leave oh oh yeah well we don't a makeup
day or what's the plan you do I guess we
can think about it to decide right this
second
what do we have another stream before we
have to worry about any of this
yeah Wednesday is it should Wednesday's
a solid should so we should get you some
for details on this Wednesday on
Wednesday yeah but then Sunday at the
Sunday after that is Christmas Eve which
is probably out and then and then
everything gets fubar
then everything gets absolutely
clusterfuck but we'll know more on
Wednesday we'll chat about hoping that
something supernatural stuff might
dissolve and I'll be able to open the
door oh I'm not doing it from no reason
a clown makeup stream ha
I bet later this week I can probably do
like some sort of you know morning Jack
scream
as a pre makeup stream we get if we
could get together on our normally an
off day that's better yeah we'll see
we'll see it gets having having uh I
have I have I have a several fractured
family yeah which basically means most
of my December is different Christmases
with different fractions of the family
yeah yeah which turns into a giant
clusterfuck stream after the okami with
you oh yeah maybe I can work that could
work
Zelda but you're a stupid dog many
people see being a stupid being a dog as
I have ival so far I'm not crazy for in
it but so far I have a decent amount of
things to say about Oh Connie a game i
never played when it first came out
was a beard oh I thought it was like a
jellyfish monster no it's a floating
beard great great it's part of the
dumbest thing I found okay well that's
fine will there be a Lego stream again
who knows the Legos are clean at the
moment the Legos are cleaned up is it
blue shirt Sunday Milwaukee no I was at
a Christmas
speaking of several Christmas parties I
was at a Christmas party earlier today
so I wore my Captain Picard make it snow
Christmas shirt oh but rich is also
wearing a blue shirt we're both wearing
blue shirts today and we're both wearing
Star Trek we're both wearing blue Star
Trek shirts today rich oh my god it's me
boast
can you believe it the ghost of Star
Trek that's exactly yes exactly woody
whiz let's see here dots 85 says hey
Jack I followed your advice and watch
which was done not entirely through yet
but damn it's nice and well made didn't
know that Germans can make such good
shows also the merriest Xmas in advance
dark is a very good show if you're into
some time-travel drama mystery who you
watch yourself some dark because it's
pretty it's pretty damn good
it's pretty dang good also the new
season of broadchurch just came to
Netflix oh man I love me some
broadchurch third ancestor who thing
it's not it's it's starring David
Tennant who was at one time though
that's that's the connection okay but
it's uh it's it's just a detective it's
just about detectives living in a small
town called broadchurch who is good he
said I bench that it's probably worse
that Hot Fuzz I mean they're both good
for different reasons
hot you know what it's not as
action-packed as Hot Fuzz that's right
and the new doctor the new doctors also
started how about funny the old doctor
and the new soon-to-be doctor star in
broadchurch and I think I heard that the
showrunner of broadchurch is the new
showrunner for Doctor Who starting next
season so that's very exciting because
it's a very well made show
a very very well Michelle if you like if
you like detective shows and I do yeah
it's it's one of those detective shows
that does a really good job of putting
up realistic red herring like you know
they give you they put you in the place
of the police and you have a lot of
options for the whodunit and they do it
really it's not Columbo it's it's the
anti Columbo
whereas instead of just being invested
in one character you are invested in
fucking everyone in this town and you're
invested in fucking everyone in the town
most of the people are very good-looking
I will be honest with you I will be
honest with you but so I didn't spoil
anything whodunits but it's very good
it's a very good show I think this is
the last season and it's very very good
psyche was just added to Amazon Prime
oh I know what I'm diggin later I could
I could rebuilt I'm scan get a good scan
Neal Brina 400 rich did you see the new
Blade Runner no Netflix yet without
getting a to spoiler I really liked the
new Blade Runner I thought I thought it
was oh you can spoil it so once those a
robot right well someone so a robot
that's not a spoiler you find that out
really really early on but so expose a
robot but uh no I thought it's really
good I thought it was I thought it was
dang near perfect I think much like that
directors other movie oh is that a
spider lady yeah oh that's the Black
Widow ha ha ha needs she lured people in
the hotel room and murders be nice
that's final no spoil okay so no
spoilers I thought it was dang near
perfect amazing sound design dripping
with visual metaphors and jokes about
Ryan Gosling's performance aside I think
I think you did a really good job I know
you know Rich's deadpan dead face Ryan
Reynolds impression is top tier but I
thought I thought its performance
oh god damn worse
ow so so well and we know I got I'm okay
no spoilers because rich hasn't seen it
and we can't like if rich sees it then
we can have a nice super spoiler
discussion but he hasn't seen it yet so
there's not even any back and forth talk
i can do with rich but i think it's very
good and I really liked the original
Blade Runner and this one I think this
very good job of adding to the world
Jerry J shared my thoughts on Blade
Runner I know he liked the new one yeah
oh yeah it's it it definitely has
interstitials it has more momentum than
the original Blade Runner in that it has
some momentum I like the original blade
I like it
executive Housewives robots replicants
are robots not genetically engineered
humans not entirely clear though really
is its yeah they're stronger than humans
the program blurs the line to me
maybe no I don't think so
the other term is Android sorry
they are Androids yes and they Dream of
Electric Sheep ah I like I like calling

have no thoughts on the movie Dark City
because I have not seen the movie it's
somewhere on my list I know that's
that's a classic right I want to talk
about film noir and sci-fi I think Dark
City doesn't rest
oh yeah I like new are in sci-fi it's
very much more do you do you think I'm
gonna see that and then like the next
page you might is entirely possible you
will like them both oh yeah not gonna be
a jackass okay I could I'm physically
capable of being jackass if whatõs that
but what it's not yes yes Jennifer
Connelly
I got her hottest okay then I got it you
know what I got to see Dark City then at
maximum hot Jennifer Connelly so really
she's been at maximum hot since like
1993 when is you name a time Jennifer
Connelly is not at maximum you know I'll
agree with you never she is never not at
maximum hot yeah Roger Ebert like Dark
City enough that he volunteered to a
commentary track on the DVD oh really
yeah Oh neat I gotta see it then I gotta
see it I'll let it I'll add it to the
fucking neverending ever-growing list
that is giving me a panic attack
been a maximum of hot since 1991 okay
that's fair okay absolutely fair
can someone explain to me how an entire
island seats tonight the last Shandor
died yeah absolutely okay let's see here
prolapsed famous this is Jack I've been
watching old streams how did that
exterior fan work out prolapsed penis is
referring to when I did my PC build I
misread a couple items when I was
because I made a very small form piece I
had tiny cakes and I misread some of the
guidelines and so the case that I got
had an interior fan and we had to move
it to the outside of the case and so
it's a very tiny form case that has a
fan sticking out of its butt and it
works great I have never had an overheat
issue it runs smoothly
whenever I using whatever I throw at it
but I mean it has it also has a very
nice graphics card so my my exterior fan
was it was a
it was a rousing success was it
especially loud no no and actually I
have it at head height it's up on my
desk
currently my in my tower yeah and and I
barely hear the thing round yeah it's
gorgeous
it's gorgeous man I've even yes that's
why it's up at desk itís so I can blow
the dust hasn't everyone I have cats
I've cat oh oh I have one very large
cats and so I have a lot of cat hair in
my house and so yeah cleaning my
computer is is important to me and and
recently actually because I've had some
issues editing on my laptop I have
recently installed all of my editing
software the nice gaming
with a very nervous about because you
know it's my gaming and I don't want to
cross the streams but what I'm really
excited about is to itas some some video
rendering like some export times at this
thing to see how fast it can fling out
mp4 five because I'm sure with that
graphics card it's gonna be nothing it's
just gonna be true shimmers goblet
architectural style range from federal
to Art Deco alright just a book I'll
take it yep
I use Premiere Pro yeah I mean I use
Premiere Pro but I also use After
Effects Photoshop lots for the for the
audio only for the prereq quick apps I
was actually editing the audio in Adobe
Audition which was really great because
I found actually the perfect way to to
cap both of our audios in audition and
so I'm going to continue using that what
I'm going to do is edit edit the
episodes in Premiere send the audio over
to audition to fuck around with it bring
it back into premiere
so if the encoder supports CUDA or
whatever it should have some good encode
times yeah it does support CUDA so I can
use my graphics card to encode the video
so so I'm thinking it's gonna rip I'm
thinking it's gonna rip that stuff right
out I'm really excited about it
do I shoot in 4k no why we shoot in
1080p cuz the majority of content viewed
on YouTube the vast majority I'm talking
we're talking 80% of content viewed on
YouTube is still done on mobile devices
I thought I bought that this whole time
ago without the he production on the
stasis beam dog that's bad yeah that's
bad what GPU I have a gtx 1070 I want to
stay I forget to be honest with you you
know
not still more and more is on mobile
devices well that's what this is what
I'm saying is the the majority of
viewers for like as as long as mobile
devices have been a thing the majority
viewers on YouTube are viewing content
on mobile devices and most of those
people are watching at something like
360p like not even high-definition you
know they're watching at an incredibly
small frame so 4k shooting for YouTube
is a little silly right now unless you
are shooting specifically to say this is
a 4k video that doesn't sound like a
real thing but I don't remember
most people have potato internet exactly
like you know for YouTube 4k is mostly
useless
I have had some clients talk to me about
shooting in 4k and whenever we are
shooting something for television
commercials I will rent a better camera
but if I'm ever making anything for a
client that is only gonna go about I'm
psyched and they asked me for 4k I
gently explain to them why and we can
keep a budget down if you don't rent a
4k camera oh shit it's all of the
Winston
Coffee for mana says hey Jack from an
from a video editor standpoint why do so
many prefer max over pcs that's a really
good question I don't know if I have a
preference goodbye
I'm sorry for a long time there I can
tell you for me as an editor it had to
do with compatibility and crashes for a
long time one of the best editing
software's out there was Final Cut and
Final Cut was an Apple based editing
software and so it ran better on Apple
machines and you wouldn't have the
crossover issues that you would have
running that on a PC
so that's probably why most people went
Apple to start with and then it's just
carried over that's true max also came
with firewire ports which interface
directly with TV cameras apples for a
long time were almost tailored towards
the creative professional that's not so
much the case anymore but I think like
so many of us just kind of grew up on
Macs and so we just keep using them now
I would have out of habit more than
anything I also think that the apple the
Apple user interface is significantly
easier than Windows and you know I'm
running Windows 10 on my gaming computer
now I'm pretty proficient with Windows
10 but I will always find a Mac and
troubleshoot I always always my Mac is
easy I think that's and I think a lot of
that is changing Apple has been pretty
deaf to the complaints of their pro
users recently they in fact only very
very recently started integrating their
laptops with moving built-in support for
external graphics cards so what you're
saying is
but basically the creative world which
is changing
so jack will he'd be getting that 15
grat grand iMac throw no I'm sure I
won't what I will be doing is making
sure that all of my external hard drives
are formatted to exFAT so they can
handle both Macs and PCs because I will
probably be transitioning over to PC Oh
a little bear now let's anyway I think
that's why a lot of people started on
Macs that's why I started on Macs and I
think I will always find the the
operating system I think I will always
find the Apple operating system then
windows but I have a nice and powerful
Windows computer right now as we love to
edit
I'm itchin rich
Jack's being deprogrammed having a
preference
for a long time Apple was had to had
some clear benefits and they no longer
have the clear benefits as as pcs did it
we're playing on a flight stick does it
look like I'm playing on a flight stick
rich has a little number pad and a mouse
I got places to go camera do we use for
a live stream we use a Panasonic gh2
it's it's actually it's it's a little
DSLR camera that has been sitting in my
office and collecting dust for a long
time well I used to shoot episodes with
us I used to use it for I still I guess
I could still use it for a secondary
camera on some of my shoots but I just
haven't had a need to use it in a very
long time so it's been collecting dust
in my office and the Elgato cam link
came out recently so it just has an HDMI
in there we go from geh to - cam link is
rich using a razor and keyboard no I'm
using like was this like a four dollar
number pad yep well here the the brand
of this number pad is wired numerical
keypad that is the brand of that
particular keypad yeah I want to say we
got that on Amazon for $4.99 the mouse
is a SteelSeries I actually did buy
another one that one had the wonky
buttons yeah yeah got rid of a lot one
that had has better buttons I'm not bad
experience with the one it's a great
Mouse what the numbers you know still
serious makes it's the rival 500 it's
the one I'm using bajo had one at home I
bought one for the studio the one of the
studio had some issues with the buttons
where the buttons weren't working I like
the product but they have to live with
the stigma that I have to say on air
that I bought a dud from
otherwise authoring the one I bought
that was a dud
sure I like the SteelSeries rival 500
okay but you might get a dud but you
might get a dud so as I do so make sure
that you have you keep your receipts
have that return policy in order so far
I'm two out of three with them but still
you got that one failure you know it's
it's it's average its average shape of
water has not released wide yet I'm
looking forward to it I think it comes
out this week and it's only playing at
one theater here in Milwaukee and so far
I think they only have like one showing
plan so I got to get my ticket to that
because I really want to see that I'm
looking forward to that picture I guess
so but it doesn't it doesn't come to
Milwaukee until I want to say this week
Thursday but I'm looking forward to it I
want to see I want to see Guillermo del
Toro's take on a romantic movie all
right let's see here that guy from the
Scotland says will we ever get another
superhero best of the worst I'll send
you my eighties hope movie where he
fights for by the way I live on an
island that won't get Star Wars till you
tell me honestly can I say anything
because I find out what I think suited
up I'm sure that seems like a likely
scenario yes and I have asked rich not
even to give a vague impression as I
have stayed pretty well away away from
any criticism or review of the movie
explain what's the other part of that
something else oh yeah another superhero
best in the world I've heard plans I've
told the story many times a long long
time ago years ago we all sat down when
we weren't recording a best doors and
came up with a list a list of ideas for
episode will best to the worst with
movies yeah that we have on the shelves
you know like oh we could do it this
thing we could do this thing we could do
this thing
we have never ever in the next three
years used that list and I want to say
somewhere on that list is like another
superhero it happens when it happens
I personally would love to do the not
the Phantom the yeah I would love to do
the Phantom I would love to do Billy
Zane The Phantom because I want that as
a kid and I loved it and I have not seen
it as an adult and I would love to
rewatch the Phantom
shurl inator says I just went on a huge
best of the list binge made my game
through the day
Jack did you see Jurassic world 2
trailer he's gonna be a Jurassic world -
why do you sound surprised
I usually made like a billion dollars
did it
it sucked so bad I did I didn't even
know there was gonna be a Jurassic world
- so I have not seen this trailer and
I'm I am frankly shocked that there is
going to be a Jurassic world - so there
you go
didn't see the PT Barnum musical trailer
yeah Hugh Jackman the world is changing
they say that in the PT Barnum musical
trailer every everybody's got a show
everybody's got a bit I guess in
reference to the rise of freaks the
world its Jenner eyes of celebrities
like it's like the shot of the bearded
lady you know I'm like Hugh Jackman I
like Zac Efron it looks like the movie
is going to gloss over some of the more
shy story aspects of PT Barnum it looks
it looks kind of like a feel-good it it
looks like what my usual problem is with
any biopic which is it was just glosses
over many aspects of that person's life
the PT Barnum
that could be found sure don't gloss
over just about other things but yeah
it's gonna be a beautiful yeah but you
know what it might be fun who knows I
would rather watch PT Barnum documentary
yeah
the world's changing the kid
like just a team movie yeah that would
be fun
but they wanted to make it a musical
because Hugh Jackman really likes to
sing and he hasn't been able to sing a
lot wasn't that was Oscar paid oh it's
not la storia no la la la la la yeah
they go I think it's I think it's that
guy oh okay
listen Hugh Jackman has had to play like
badass Wolverine for the past decade and
he's like listen guys I just want to
sing and dance now for the rest of my
career
which he's entitled to he gets to do
whatever he wants is he gay
no I don't want to be Wolverine I want
to dance first of all there's nothing
I'm not saying there's anything wrong
with it I'm just asking yes he came
first of all hurtful stereotypes
second of all no actually has a very
long marriage cool my my gay uncle has
like The Wizard of Oz collectors place
stereotypes come from somewhere the man
just likes to sing and dance rich that
does not make him gay I know what was I
watching they just did an interview with
him recently where he was it was him and
his wife he met his wife on an
Australian daytime soap opera she was
like the big lead actress on this
Australian daytime soap and he was in
fresh new kid and he loved her okay he
was just okay he was madly and deeply in
love with this lady who was way beyond
him like oh she's a big celebrity she's
a big star and
the tables and now she's not acting like
she's still there be honest thanks Mary
as a smoke screen
please ever that's never happened that's
never happened you think she might be a
beard is that I'm saying it's possible
I'm saying I'm throwing it out there
awesome bility I mean well then it's
like that's a possibility as in anyone's
wife as a possible you know I'm probably
not gonna happen that much in the days
to come because you know the world just
changing and being gay is no longer a
thing that has to be like a stigma right
but a sham marriage could be a stigma so
now he's just stuck in it every day is
like shit Hollywood's cool with gay
people not damn it well he's he's not
just a gay person remember his spin his
horrible horrible disgusting obviously
you know Kevin's fit for fuck sake well
I do know his horrible spin yes sure I
acted inappropriately to many people but
I am coming out of closet huh let's do
anything FX yeah I caused it now and
everyone's like Kevin we've known for
years man that doesn't make it
appropriate to uh to you know unwanted
sexual advances and groping buzz put him
out now congrat I'm gonna go to parades
man it's gonna be great
yeah that was that was nice
that was absolutely nuts by the way
luckily no one bought it yeah no first
they did which is what's nice cuz like
maybe someone could have been like uh uh
maybe now but no one bought it so that's
great well like that Jerry Smith Kevin
Spacey's career is changing no I hear
Bryan Singer's really excited to work
with them hiding hiding out under the
rainbow I like that the farts awaken
somewhere under the rainbow he touched
me I said no but I was a nobody
oh I want a job in Hollywood so I'll do
what oh no a lot of rhymes I had I
thought I had something but I lost the
time rainbow shields the story of Kevin
Spacey oh hey kids
the rainbow shoes I like it rich
so you know Laurel story hugh jackman
this got wife they seem to generally dig
each other but he's you know he's also
an actor so you never know just know and
I don't mean like all actors are gay I
mean he's an actor he tricks people for
a living so a beard
for those people in Japanese seem to be
curious about this is the the nickname
they gave two women who gay men get with
to try to pretend that they're not big
beard the thing that makes them look
more manly
wasn't going up I have to cut off flow
of this stuff so excuse me
down seems like the way it would need to
go or out does it have to open like barn
doors or is it a door or is it a game
see there's a river of slime coming
through here okay that's what needs to
be cut off yeah but it doesn't look like
there are tracks going down it looks
like there are tracks going yeah is this
your only weapon to solve this problem
no but it's the only one the seam
doesn't work like a trial I got like the
capture stream connection the roof ends
that's just not it's not grabbing this
ray kellogg's crown flakes has a
question with which is what's with Rose
McGowan though she's on some crusade
hating everybody and alienating herself
from everyone so I know very little
about this Rose McGowan has been
outspoken about Harvey Weinstein's
sexual misconduct yeah for years now
okay she has been trying to tell anyone
who will listen about Harvey Weinstein
being a crazy depraved freak and hurting
people's jobs if they didn't have
performed sexual acts with him right and
it cost her her career okay okay and so
finally the rest of the world has caught
up with Rose McGowan and she is saying
yes yes yes I've told you let's let's
you know she's just you know she's
correct is what's going on with Rose
McGowan yes Mira Sorvino is another one
whose career
got kibosh because she refused to do
things with Harvey what yeah well who is
that actress in the Frieda what was her
name the Salma Hayek had it was it was a
similar situation you know sure no Knorr
I just had a thought on the public and
so she she has been the reason that
you're hearing a lot about her recently
is that you know she finally gets to say
I told you so
oh oh are those weights oh there you go
those are like switches there you go so
I'm not going to I'm not gonna blame
Rose McGowan for taking a bit of a
victory lap here
so but yeah like the the the moral of
the story is if there was any like young
actress that you really enjoyed in like
the mid-90s and was in a couple of
movies and look like their star was on
the rise and then all of a sudden just
disappeared out of nowhere he said oh
hey wonder whatever happened to that
actress
they probably refused to sleep with
Harvey Weinstein and their career
abruptly ended is the moral of the story
absolutely let's see what we got here
Edo canítö says hey guys did you ever
play Wing Commander three or its sequels
that sounds like rich games I got around
reaches Ferguson okay no and I have not
either there's space combat flight Sims
with the action cutscene starring Mark
Hamill I played a little bit of one of
them I forgot which one I did not hate
it
okay they're cheap on GOG right now and
I own them on GOG I bought the one I saw
him on sale on GOG a while back I
haven't gotten around him for sure I
know a long time ago I played one of the
older ones uh-huh and I liked them
I mean tie-fighter like more so I played
a fighter right right right
I need to give some of the later Wing
Commanders a shot okay we can do that we
can do that we have the power
there are so many Star Wars games on GOG
yes oh yeah why I wonder why they would
be on sale right now Oh
what oh I just came to a realization
what you do know I didn't really do
anything I'm having an easier time with
sections that when I first played this
game really just kicked me in the nuts
okay like I remember that section I just
got through without dying yeah used to
be really difficult for me
uh-huh I realize when this game came out
I didn't have a PC cable applying it I
played the console version I am now
playing it with a mouse and it's like I
remember I used to die a bunch there
okay let's see here what do we got here
valiant bloodshot says what's your
favorite film this year
mine are ladybird free billboards
outside Epping Missouri and Blade Runner
20:49 I'm most looking forward to the
West Anderson I love dogs came out for
sure that's the that's that is the
biggest problem rich I can never
remember right about this year I'd like
was good guardians of galaxy to was good
what else do they actually get around to
seeing seeing Blade Runner in the
theater was really great I enjoyed that
a lot movie I don't best this year man I
don't know in the years not over and the
years not over I still have movies to
see so I don't got it I don't got a good
answer for you valiant bloodshot and I'm
sorry Blade Runner is up there I really
enjoy Blade Runner I thought that was
like I said I thought that was damn near
perfect that was damn near perfect I'll
probably shit I'm that director he makes
good movies see that oh crap I forgot
the moon
the movie he did before played on that
with the aliens
a rifle thank you jesus H Christ see a
rifle first it's really good and it was
Sicario that's another one that I need
to see that was the movie he did before
was very very good
I haven't seen baby driver come III hear
very good things about baby driver have
not seen it hoping to do that so many so
fucking many movies to see games play TV
shows to watch also books to read too so
many books three comic books today we
all want to read all the comic books
also did we heard this podcast there's
this great podcast that you should
listen to also oh you have to find some
time to make the videos about all the
other stuff and don't forget about works
just you know doing work and god I gotta
do normal work like how do you like
seeing family or friends because that's
got fit that the board games there's so
many board games rich there's so many
there's so many things I do Jack calm
calm the fuck down
Jesus fuck never
Jesus Jack you are falling behind on
your media consumption I am I am because
there because there's a lot there's a
lot to see and sometimes when you make
media there is this really tricky
balance between consuming and making and
you know if you consume too much then
you don't get to make as much and if you
make too much then you don't get to
consume too much and as you obviously
got bounced like I can't see cinnamon I
can't cut out this whole raising kids
part that's that's you get arrested for
that
if you cut that out of your life I guess
I could there's no good reason you
couldn't give them away for adoption you
know there's they just really need a
couple more years and and they're mostly
in self-sufficient this must be where
all the mood slime came from look they
must have pumped it straight into the
sewers LED TV raised them said putter
play that's how I grew up at that point
and I get it they get plenty of TV Oh
