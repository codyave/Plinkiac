yeah we've been we've been Zelda English
yeah Zelda ain't never got a boring
alright slave spy off there we go
boink alright and the new character
which is in the beta yeah it is a beta
there is a beta version of the early
access game makes sense because they
want to they want them one that everyone
could play to be the stablest release
right right and beta they're playing
around what shit it's not necessarily
stable that makes sense
robot wizard it's a robot wizard so i
don't know anything about this new
character
neither do it neither do i we are
slay the spiring done and we just we
just signed up for the beta thing ok
when you want to be in the beta so it
should be ok it's just actually the
minute we check that it started updating
so I think we're gonna be alright
yeah so hey you know what let's find out
you want to download to this machine
yeah oh yeah slay the spire beta we are
in the beta and so all we need to do is
play as the what did it say we needed to
do place to silent I think plays a scion
yeah
and then we can play as the robot come
they go that's a robot I thought you
said you know nothing in according to
the thing instead it's a robot it's a
robot wizard it's a robot wizard robot
wizard yeah the fuck yeah
anonymous says one you guys gonna do
that injustice to e it's the perfect
time since you guys are riding off that
Avengers hi oh fuck what happened I
click the exit game instead of exit menu
it's fine it's fine
everything can you believe that plot
twist Bruce Willis was dead the whole
time ah spoiler joke I get it
captain Bacardi third says hey guys I
love the recent best of the word a
breath of the wild streams there we go
you got me replaying the game and I'm
having a lot of fun you're welcome
mater says look like Bruce Willis I
doesn't
we can't do this because I've never
played the beta in order to unlock the
silent we need to complete a single run
the say--let started unlocked normally
right I believe so
dammit
why can't we see the green screen now
are you sure we can't just start a run
and die and have that count
yeah let's you know what let's find out
you gotta check this out really quick
are we are is our green screen flipping
out a little bit every time we check
it's not and then I go back and look at
the footage and there's something fucked
up going on yeah every time every time
I'm sorry yeah
started running and quit and it will
come okay no no no
Vanda the rod I think defeat our view
it's a bit hinky yeah I don't know why
we gotta figure out what's going on
there's a lot of stuff we need to figure
out in life in general somebody to get
it what I what I believe is happening
with our green screen is if a bright
color happens on the TV it affects don't
you know what that's that's an
interesting thought because our lights
in here are relatively dark yeah
relatively speaking you know there you
go and we keep them in here relatively
dark so like we're not super distracted
by the you know I you know what I bet we
need well if we had a couple lights
specifically for the green screen yep
I think I know what to do I think I
haven't I think I have a way to to make
this happen okay so now if we choose the
silent
what is it safe it'll I think oh no
never mind
wait so do we have to do the same thing
I don't know yes we're playing on the
beta
bright ambient I would totally explain
it would because our our our ambient
light is rather dim and so if like a big
blue light happens on our TV that would
affect the green screen right maybe it's
selfish but you know we'd rather not be
playing games in a giant brightly lit
room oh there you go well you know it
would be distracting but if we had a
light specifically on the green screen
that would be slightly brighter that's
behind us all right here we go boom the
defect the defects cracked core at the
start of each combat channel one
lightning okay another try oh it's one
of those robot things which those real
bad things this is like an enemy which
ones there's an enemy that has like a
blue orb and there's a lot of weird
enemies
let's see here this is to a fire that
gets us to a shop
fire
let's try try this one let's try this
way okay Oh what Hunchback Jack says
that's your lightning at the end of turn
do three damage to a random enemy evoke
deal eight damage to a random enemy or
slots something they save up I don't
know I don't know all right this is
where were new things we're getting new
things blue cards that's so weird
looking yeah evoke your next or but two
times hundred back Jack says hey Jack
and British have you played the Back to
the Future game I've been playing lately
and well it lacks any significant
gameplay I admit to being charmed by it
it mails the feel of Anubis
I never finished it but the guy they got
to basically do a Michael J Fox
impersonation
spot-on oh yeah yeah and then Doc
brownness I believe just Christopher
Lloyd and came back to do it Oh fun
oh okay I'm fine I'm figuring it out
what are you figuring out how the orbs
work home do they work you have a card
that gives you an orb and then you have
a card that can play the orb like you
can't just click on an orb to evoke it
really you need a car that says evoke I
believe huh huh oh wait I think
yeah like you can't just click on an orb
okay but then here like you have this
like evoke your next orb two times this
is an Evoque card
alright enough but it's alright we're
doing it we're figuring it out what type
of game is it let's just impose it on
are you talking about the Back to the
Future game that's was that last gen is
last gen there was a PlayStation 3 era
right was it I know I don't remember
telltale games oh the tell-tale back
yeah sure sure okay so an adventure game
right like The Walking Dead
what is the one that's invaded and say
well what did that do
oh I think that was just like betta
artwork okay that's what that means yeah
I assume that's what betta man I figured
was something had to do with this being
the betta rather than they meant for
that card to say beta they're so weird
but maybe you know we are a robot so
maybe his car like even his cars are in
beta I could have seen them doing
something like that because he's a robot
yeah I assume it's just beta art artwork
that was this one nope shit that was
that one
god damn oh well we'll get one card game
seven block x times nice that's a good
card another question another question
mark question york queers to New York
dommage great so is the orbital then
just consistently do three damage a turn
if you don't do anything with it yes but
when you use it it's gone and with what
when you use this is gone and then you
can get these cards which give you orbs
so you can just hang out with that orb
there and just keep playing defense
exactly exactly like this one does six
damage and channels one frost so then
this a frost orb at the end of each turn
game to block
it's all I get - I only got to block
their car I'm onto your game cultist
you give me more lightning
and and will drink cuz I get to okay I'm
getting this I'm getting this this is
need this is neat this is different the
orbs this is definitely different this
isn't just like you know I feel like the
other two were just basically different
cards you know like the poison cards
attack cards but this is a whole new
thing
the cars that significantly changed up
the way they played oh sure but there
was just new cards here here there's a
whole expose this is just new cards to
but it feels it feels different like
that that's that's nice this is
interesting static discharge whenever
you take attack damage channel one
lightning
got it head Oquendo says you guys ever
consider revisiting no man's sky I've
heard the game is no longer a giant
piece of shit and is actually kind of
decent no but I no longer own my copy of
the game
yet probably not not even it's a little
too late not even a little part of me
wants to look at that game again ever
there's so much other shit I'd actually
rather do right yeah like unless someone
said like oh they've put out a free
patch that completely changes absolutely
everything about the game and then there
there's there's just nothing that I want
to
block it cost for I don't even have 400
I guess I get it nevermind I get it
three cards is this a roguelike but with
cards kind of absolutely yeah yeah yeah
it definitely is the the you go through
you unlock more cards that can be added
to your hand every time you play the
game it's a different you have a
different hand it's a different
experience
didn't do and this is the this is the
brand new character just revealed in
beta form and as you can see for some of
my cards even the cards don't have
artwork on them yet which is crazy
I'd hate to have a ton of the ones just
say baby yeah cuz a lot of times you
remember them by my birthday yeah it
really it would really throw me for a
loop it would just it would just take
like a ton of extra reading yeah I mean
what ones this one again map yeah I know
what potions are or if you have the one
car that says beta but you think it's
the other card that says Batum discard
any of them gain three block returned a
random card from your discard pile to
your hand or gain one orbs lon yeah I'm
going full orbed slot that sounds that
sounds horrible
oh yeah I'm a norm slot want all them
orbs
yeah that's great I did say slot yes you
did say slut it's arm slot
right great
can you give me all them orbs there a
chance of a got him or review yeah
there's a very good chance I'd said in
fact it was at my feet right now is my
camera bag because we were supposed to
film our our review today before the
stream was not far enough in and it was
not far enough I don't I don't want to
spoil anything for rich and I didn't
want to but you know like we were
talking about this last week a little
bit yeah and it's like yo when can we
get the review and I said well Richie I
need you to get to at least X part of
the game and no spoilers and and I said
don't worry you'll know it when you get
there and and rich you thought you got
there but it wasn't the part and so by
now it's just you have to finish the
story of the game so your foot we're far
enough in where you just have to finish
the story then we'll have plenty to talk
about
four hours in this is gonna be a five
hours stream you probably we did start
early and I don't want to feel like I'm
shipping you guys who didn't know we
were going to start really he's we
didn't we didn't announce anything about
it we just did it yeah yeah we'll give
me the extra slot card I got a power of
power yeah
hey deal with it look you're next or two
times so I think this is my next or but
it's like whatever the front orb is yeah
so I could gain ten block but this will
get me even more block
oh that's great that's great wonder what
other kind of orgs they got you just
destroyed well you got to what you have
to eat it a card to discharge the or
break yeah I believe more like a
mushroom growing out of a dead mouse
that's kind of exactly what it is you're
fighting the mushroom not the mouse yeah
yeah a random command card into your
hand that's interesting that's in beta
artwork I've never seen it look at that
artwork you know what I guess we kind of
need that then we need that card just
for that adorable our org looks like you
just whipped it up into mspaint real
quick yeah I mean look at that's all of
it look look at the defend Wow
strike I think is is pretty close to
being on but yeah game to orb slots yeah
full orb slot
that's my goal that's my game you find
no fucks about artwork this is the
busines bata it's the right there that
you know what they're trying to hone
gameplay what is shocking a shocking
thing here they're like hey let's put
these cards out there we know what they
want to do we'll deal with you know how
it looks later right
you find a shimmering mass of light
encompassing the center of the room
it's warm glow and enchanting patterns
invite you in my damage 9 bluff great
yeah I'll need to heal sooner or later
Jack trigger Joyce questions I have a
question I've been dying to ask where do
you get your ideas from does anybody
know where they get ideas from I have no
idea where ideas come from they just
appear just appear that's they just
appear that's that's kind of it either
you know something you saw a while back
and you think of a way to tweak it or
just they just appear it's just
something dumb you want to do
your brain your brain has a random spark
mix this with another random spark and
hey how about this yeah I just had a
thought
we humans really love to form patterns
out of nothing huh since since the dawn
of our consciousness we have loved to
form patterns out of nothing
and that's all ideas are is just that
these these little separate things and
they'll put them together see what
happens there's any one answer right
let's see here
this is he's gonna he's gonna run away
soon enough the brain just takes various
ideas and churns them together and
remixes them yeah
and get out of here defend
there we go we got him we got him so we
don't have free will
that free was overrated I mean we don't
have free well get out of here of course
we have free well of course we have free
well but you know the the the the random
what are you talking about we don't have
free will six damage evoke your necks
are removal
yes yeah I'm okay of course we have free
well free will and random and random
actions don't necessarily oppose each
other I don't know about that I mean I
don't know I don't know that we have
free will
okay I don't know that I'm sufficiently
convinced what does it mean well I was
good I was that was gonna be my very
next question is define free will for me
the ability the ability to choose our
next action is free will and I think we
have that I think we have the ability to
choose whatever we do next you know you
know why I know that so many people fail
and die and that means that they they
chose poorly I I think I think there's
there's too much randomization in the
concept of free will for me to be
comfortable with it I like the idea but
if I am put in this particular situation
every time I'm gonna make the same
choice
cuz that's what makes me me that kid's
gonna hit my bus you gonna jump out of
the way to save him yes that that's
that's the thing I would do yeah that's
the thing you choose don't they have
free will it would be like sometimes I
wouldn't choose to do that sometimes you
wouldn't because every situation is
different
are you meeting the exact same thing
yeah in the exact same situation yeah
but I think you're you have it backwards
you have freewill and so you would do
the same thing in every situation
because you have made those choices to
make that decision okay
wait what
it's too bad supply three weeks imagine
bitches like the doctor in Voyager who
said everything was set in stone
during the BIGBANG BIGBANG BIGBANG uh
yeah thanks it's very likely that
everything was set in stone yeah ah like
all choices were set in stone a big big
bang so no matter what we do it was
meant to be that way we're just going to
be that way an event implies some kind
of design hmmm that that's it that's
that seems to it was just going to be
that way and that that seems to be
looking at it from a hindsight
perspective
Jack did Michelangelo carved the David
or David under the stone all the time he
just gym parts away that weren't David
he carved the David don't be dumb I know
I know there's some there's some artists
bullshit out there that says no the
painting was always on the canvas and I
just revealed it and that's an artist
being an asshole
Michelangelo studied practiced and spent
his entire life focusing on how to carve
away stone to make a thing and so he
made a thing are are you saying that
rich you could right now take a hunk of
marble and and Michelangelo would appear
just because he was there to begin when
I was being cute I know and I was
pulling a classic rich I know I know you
flipped you flip the dynamic flipped the
script rich and you weren't comfortable
with it Michael always an asshole
Michelangelo was an asshole I'm sure I
smiled Jack everyone was amazed I'm fine
with it I suppose there's a limit on the
amount of cards you can get that expand
your warm slots can you imagine what
this would look like if you had like a
hundred of those cards I would love that
and I'm not I'm not going to seriously
argue with you about the freewill issue
because this isn't something I've
actually sat down and thought that
deeply uh right
oh yeah that's all it's all Wibbly
wibbly-wobbly
lightning orb never play this card abuse
costs we're doing great
rubber fistfights says actually Kate
Mulgrew was convinced that Janeway had
an undiagnosed psyche psychotic S
condition because of how all over the
place her writing was so she played
Janeway like she was insane that does
help Janeway make a lot more sense it
just makes you love Kate Mulgrew even
more than just Kate Mulgrew is great
perhaps perhaps traveling through like
what was the thing they traveled through
traveling through the the conduits which
caused her to go insane oh you mean when
when they first got there why didn't
affect everyone else maybe a dude oh wow
but what B'Elanna tourists went through
the pond far for Christ's sake
they they rich they traveled back in
time maybe that was a mass illusion due
due to psychosis if turning into a
salamander doesn't fuck up your brain I
don't know what will dad Captain Janeway
turned into a salamander in one episode
of Star Trek Voyager this is why people
don't like the show not just Janeway was
Janeway and Paris right and didn't they
have salamander babies she also murdered
a very nice person because she missed
her friend yes let's race yet she had
salamander babies with salamander Tom
Paris she so so she she's salamander
fucks Tom Paris which is an accurate
statement and then on one episode she
straight up murdered someone because she
wanted her friend back she made the
wrong call ordered her goons to cart him
off to be executed yeah but a person who
by the way was pretty awesome super
super helpful super nice he was the best
of both the Tuvok and Neelix and would
have been an asset to the crew yes yes
murdered him murdered him
two Vic's was a Mary Sue that was kind
of the point
I know you meant that as a joke two
Vic's was great I know we were supposed
to feel sad because we lost to Vox and
Neelix yes
oh I like that tell my man upon pickup
upgrade to random attacks to fix wasn't
great he was a whitey covered so you're
saying he deserved to die then think
about it hey don't I don't know how you
could justify Janeway's actions
no no to tuvok's
was both super smart logic and logical
but also empathetic and pleasant to be
around to fix would have been an asset
to that crew and was a unique individual
with his own consciousness yeah no
matter how you play it Janeway murdered
him
how would Janeway feel if somebody
wanted to rip her in two because
somebody thought they could make two
decent people out of him fuck would Jane
wait now about that you know what your
personality is all over the place
Janeway I'm gonna rip you apart
because I like this jean way better now
to be fair that Janeway with the other
one can cook for us
damn right
it's a significant amount of people
watch this and just be absolutely
confused talk about Star Trek Voyager
very important discussion here there's
an episode with the characters of Neelix
and to Vox were fused together in a
transporter accident right
and it came one person to vixx they
became a third entity to vixx and the
memories of both huh had the memories
both had the memories and personality
traits of both yeah and then Janeway
decided to rip two Vic's apart against
the protest of two Vic's because of
course tuvok's
was a third individual who literally had
to be dragged to the transporter room
begging for his life by Janeway's goons
that's how the episode ends great him
pleading with people to help him but
nobody did honestly think about that I
know I think oh that no one helps I can
so I guess you know what we can't just
blame Jane wait I mean Janeway made the
call but someone on that crew should
have been the voice of reason so it's
all is that we have to blame the whole
crew keeping to fix around requires
killing two people two deaths is worse
than one
Tuvok should back to vixen diamond no no
because they weren't those two were
already dead when the transporter
accident happened right uh it was no
one's fault the transporter accident
right no one purposefully set the
transporter to merge them yes
so to riches absolutely correct two
people had already died at that point
you're playing God you're trying to
bring people back to life wrong call
Janeway
look at how many orbs I have all the
orbs oh yes
whenever I take damage I get one
lightning warm
well I just got slimed that must be a
new card I haven't played this in a
while
I just got slimed oh yeah that's been a
thing for a while and the slime monsters
now yeah really super obnoxious I I'm
noticing it has made the remember the
slime boss from the first level I was
kind of a cakewalk
yeah Oh Oh No now that bad boss battle
is a pain in the ass shit
sausage toast says so the players asked
for a third character and the devs give
them blue balls nice nice well done well
done Jen this new character is very much
not balanced or completely flushed out
well welcome to the beta
welcome to the beta build I just want to
see what yeah we like we're not here to
like critique or judge this remember
everyone and this is I know something we
said earlier you might have missed it
this is the beta version of the early
access game so like we're not expecting
half of these cards have mspaint art
we're not here to really criticize we're
just so I just want to check it out
where do you see you to check it out you
know damaging folk you next orbit I want
to keep mining the real problem of the
Voyager was that it was a writing crew
already burnt out plus they didn't
accept spec scripts anymore so they
really were screwed for ideas huh it
stopped accepting spec scripts by then
that was always a famous thing with Star
Trek they would accept fan scripts oh
really but it necessarily you'll didn't
make everyone they got said oh sure you
can submit a script to them and they
might use it oh that's fun yeah
future Prezi says hey rich and jack-high
imagine a world where you have the
opportunity to completely retcon the
entire Star Wars prequels how do you
change the story love you guys
okay I would do nothing and stop making
movies after Return of the Jedi and I
would look forward to the future and
other new ideas that people might come
up with that's my idea that's my bitch
you're you're in charge and Lucas is on
you go you go George he had the great
success with Star Wars he did the
Indiana Jones thing that's great I will
I will finance any movie you want made
as long as it is a new intellectual
property George any movie hit me up
George we can make this happen
I will not make a Star Wars movie about
like like fairies in a garden or so fine
fuck it that's fine whatever that wasn't
what he made he made it was it cool I
was gonna say the name as a joke but I
couldn't remember it but by the way
that's fine that's something new yeah I
want to make the movie with the black
airplane drivers yeah go make it make it
now he made he made like a fairy movie
strange magic thank you chat is what we
called strange magic perfect let's make
it let's make it
I will give you money for that
look at that look at that art I almost
prefer the EMAs painter that's so great
interesting
interesting Jack you have anything to
add about chance to remake the prequels
thing and I'm firmly on team we don't
need them no and I think that's fine
like let's assume there's there's a
world in which the prequels are going to
be made no matter what yeah and and I
have I have some sort of sway within
Lucas or within whoever right yeah I I
would just and this is this applies to
that this applies to the new ones being
made where it's just like let's just try
to make them dumb fun adventure movies
like we don't need to go into the lore
let's just let's just make some
adventure movies remember it remember
George you wanted to base them off of
the serials the the science fiction
series do you remember mr. Lucas what if
we just made some space fun some fun
space movies wouldn't that be great we
don't need to worry about continuity as
to make some adventure movies but so
that would be my only thing is just
remember remember to keep them fun yeah
let's try to keep them fun
look financially I know that's not the
way to go I'm talking about what I would
like to see ya
and that's what I would like to see
nothing right right right
no that's fair it's really fair rich
so I'm saying axe kick stole those
damage if you don't have an own to evoke
oh is that true I'm screwing reading the
thing great
think I'm lightening him maybe that last
yes
great
prequels would have been a lot better
with just a good second pass on the
writing editing stage and third and
fourth and fifth they're not very well
thought out
oh fuck yeah
so any reason that Star Wars took place
a long time ago yes because they're not
really science fiction movies they're
fantasy movies the fairy tales and fairy
tales take place a long time ago in the
whenever yeah the sci-fi the sci-fi
aspects of Star Wars Star Wars that's
that's superficial that's window
dressing it's really a spaceship it's
about yeah it's about wizards and
instead of instead of riding horses
they're flying spaceships but it's
wizards and knights and magic yeah
it's a way of saying once upon a time
that you can copyright
that's beautiful but beautiful rich
space wizards and big dogs and fly
spaceships or some kind of sidekick ogre
type creature yep
for the elves he walks alderaanians well
like not every not everything fantasy
needs to be Tolkien's right right till I
know Tolkien kind of has like the market
cornered you need L you need you know
light but smart and rich elves and dumb
but strong ogres and it's not a
one-for-one right it's not one for one
Toki and fantasy but it's it's it's the
heat it's the hero but it's definitely
wizards and knights and magic it's the
hero finds the sword and defeats the
villain yeah absolutely
it's not a speculative fiction and how
nanotechnology might affect the future

says don't you gents agree that a movie
based on Christopher Lee's time and the
Ministry of ungentlemanly warfare in
World War two needs to be made sure what
I mean
sure why not from from all accounts
Christopher Lee is an absolute badass
what movie was it was a attack of the
clones when he was explaining how it
really sounded would somebody got
stabbed in the back he'd actually done
it to someone but it was a Lord of the
Rings for the Rings when Saruman gets
stabbed Peter Jackson's started
explaining to him what he should sound
like with his throat gurgling with blood
and he says there is no need to explain
that to me I know what it sounds like
when a man is stabbed through the throat
the only man who like new Tolkien right
like he Nutella candy yeah I didn't know
that oh fuck yeah he need a new token he
went to war he he was he is the the
badass when he's he's 90 some years old
playing in heavy metal bands god damn it
he's a badass yeah he was doing vocals
for like for like demonic rock respect
for Christopher Lee than ever before yes
he knew he knew Tolkien personally and
is the only person who ever got
Tolkien's blessing to play Gandalf
Gandalf Gandalf here's the other one
he was so Roman oh but he wanted him to
play again
back it back in the day back in the day
back in the day told when you know way
back in the day when Tolkien was still
alive and they're talking about movie
rights or whatever he's the only one to
personally get Toki and seal of approval
huh to play Gandalf even though he ended
up playing so Vermont yeah that's a
great question uh Christopher Lee's
sneaky SMED stand for 15 months in a row
Greg Koenig says thanks for the great
stream guys Jack do you have any
anecdotes or advice about becoming a
parent I'm currently expecting my first
I'm gonna this is gonna sound like a
real bummer and I know and I don't mean
to sound like a bummer because like I
like kids and I'm really glad I had kids
but having kids is way harder than you
think it's going to be and so basically
my only advice is prepare as best you
can to have your life completely wrecked
and that's not that's not to say that's
not a bad thing this sounds like it
sounds like bitter sour grapes no no
what did that my life got ruined I'm
glad what what I mean by wrecked is
everything you do now
it's not gonna be there totally worth
elbow-deep and fecal matter for three
years
honestly totally straight years of shit
and puke everywhere but what I'm saying
is everything you have now it's gonna
change and it's gonna be different
everything you have now will be
destroyed but you'll get something else
out of it there is that there is a
positive to this you get to hopefully
leave the world better than you then you
found it by it by raising a youngin but
everything will change and it's okay to
ask for help and I grew up and they're
gonna vote for krump oh my god you make
sure raised them not to be horrible
dickheads
but like don't be don't be afraid to ask
for help don't be afraid to take a break
don't be afraid to to reach out to a
support network it's it's tough having
kids is fucking tough so all right I'm a
terrible salesman for Parenthood fucking
good it is tough having kids is so hard
and I wanted them and I thought I was
prepared it wrecked me like my first kid
that that like years after I had my
first kid I was a goddamn mess
I'm good now but so proxy dude fuck
