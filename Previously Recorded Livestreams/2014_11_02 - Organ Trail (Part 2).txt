Chicago let's go
Oh a bandit steals 10 ammo dam bandits

raining a gas can fell off the car and
spilled come on come on car but we did
get roadkill
I did who I find an upgrade to your car
in an abandoned garage

you'll have to you have to stop and take
a look at your car sure all right we've
made it to Chicago hi Oh what what did
we get here upgrades
oh we got a soup our last battery less
likely for the battery to die and we got
chainsaw windows automatically succeeds
in fighting through hordes that's great
that's great let's I think we need to
repair some of the station wagon here
you scrapped or repair your station
wagon let's use to scrap all right we're
repairing the station wagon great
yes repairs successful 12 to 32 percent
chance of success and you nailed that
20% you know what I didn't even see this
percent the more scrap you use the
higher your chances oh I didn't see that
yeah how funny I'm just lucky I guess
you are very lucky
hey it down let's see what we have here
whoo defense no no more suicide
difficulty I was lucky to get out alive
and I dropped something precious in a
horde of zombies okay Oh both of them
are suicide difficulty cut dammit
somebody Chicago wasn't safe before the
zombie apocalypse
you know that means this is this a
fucking sting right there yeah what do
we got here

tires no slowdown during rainstorms fuck
that I don't need that I don't need that
I'm just gonna get out of here okay I'm
just gonna say fuck it let's get out of
here okay

candy next to a pile of organs yay

discovered that one of my gas tanks is
filled with water okay here we go
Oh No Kirkman 1987 breaks a rib
oh yeah he's those potholes damn it
yeah we're here at the remote Shack
which looks nothing like the Evil Dead
you'll see that in a second
med kids have a chance to appear okay
well first thing we need to do hold on
first thing we need to do is med kit up
Kirkman Jesus Christ I'm not gonna you
can't rest your party - and that will
also increase their health I'm not okay
I'm not ready to kill anyone yet we're
gonna arrest them for three hours okay
almost lost Kirkman I almost lost
Kirkland but on alright great they're
all rested back to the town here what
are the jobs a crate fell out and this
is just dangerous I'm gonna give this a
try cuz it's just dangerous find me a
crate what the zombie apocalypse improve
Detroit gooo I'm sure it's a fine City
shit shit shit oh god I suck oh I hated
those you have to shoot them all I know
I was running I just for some in my head
those Crowley zombies aren't as fast as
other zombies but they're actually the
faster ones I think so yes and so it got
me okay and kami um what do they have
here they have scrapped their food their
fuel
what's my fuel like supply I have seven
point five a few I don't know what that
means
what's what's your ammo two ammo is 73 I
think that's good I have in a way I have
more than enough food and med kits are
fine like I said it's like I always want
to sell something because they have a
they have a combat trainer that gives
you the ability to have fine med kits
but I'm not too worried about it what's
the chat saying somebody was asking what
the name of this game was it's the organ
trail haha to get it yep see hey do you
guys get it
alright I'm getting out of here oh no
you suddenly find yourself surrounded by
zombies well you know I think that's
what the chainsaws are for yeah I think
Oh nobody for some reason I got out of
my car with the chainsaw windows and I'm
just shooting them that's a dog
surrounded okay that's different than
the Horde in front
all right shit shit shit shit
yeah the other thing I I mentioned to
the chat while you were how it is like
remember that I'm playing this with my
trackpad oh damn so it's like shooting
zombies is quite difficult fucked I did
it though I did it
well the trackpad I'm impressed
something catches your eye off the road
would you like to get out and
investigate yes yes I would some guy
comes up to you and hands you 100
bullets I don't need these anymore
before you can say anything he walks
into the distance all right got some
bullets that's really nice
he must have found a chainsaw he took a
chains off my windows yeah will you find
some roadkill it's probably safe to eat
all right here we go here we go here we
go you hear gunfire from nearby
buildings shit oh okay nothing happens
that's great something catches your eye
off the road would you like to get out
and investigate yes you see a shady
looking fellow with a game of cups set
up on the side of the road care to try
your luck no I'm not feeling
particularly lucky you know what never
play those games people never oh we've
made it to st. Louis jobs
Scott Damon I dropped something and it's
just one med kit I don't care about your
jobs auto shop oh those are terrible

or the jobs I'm just they they were they
we had no good
I checked the job one was a suicide
difficulty and the other one only gave
me one med kit and I was like I don't
need one med kit I you must cross a
horde of zombies in order to continue on
the road the Horde in front of you is
currently small in size but appears to
be agitated but I can automatically
fight through does it actually give you
an option that says that I'm yeah it
does
Oh neat because I have chainsaw windows

windows kept the Horde at bay hooray

to ammo no oh my battery broke but I was
able to replace it from supplies great
this guy clears up great
all right apparently I'm not able to
stop for some reason which is fine a
heavy fog rolls in you are forced to
drive more slowly oh we've made it to
the cave jobs a crate fell out this is a
dangerous but $28 let me win a combat
trainer 5% faster move that is really
worth it 80 bucks though I want I walk
that you can sell things I think I will
actually sell things what am I gonna
sell here sell some med kits
because I can always buy it back because
if I if I'm a better fighter if I can
move faster I can get more of these jobs

an option you know but now hello Draco
was holding the map upside down and I go
an hour out of my way although this time
we're stopping I might kill someone I
might kill ed Witten
you're worried about an infected
survivor turning and causing harm to the
rest of your party you can put them down
in fact it's not received only become
zombies when they're out of health is
saying in the chat I am deeply sorry
jack and went he he's now ed Witten

right now I feel comfortable driving set
pace
what's then let's set pace rich oh you
can change how fast you drive oh okay
you drive slower your car takes less
damage but you know takes you longer to
get to the end of the road hmm so you
use it more food and whatnot and the
faster you go the more likely they are
to fuck up your car
oh okay I can sell sauce crab you can
also change like food rations
cancel cancel what can i buy again
nothing I'm getting out of here I'm
getting out of here this town sucks

couple hours three hours rests that's a
long drive faster is Ed Witten talking
in the chat no everybody's talking shit
about what he actually said is he says I
leave the stream for 15 minutes and this
is what happens to my reputation yep
and I'm gonna scavenge again that seems
that seems to be working out yeah ooh

in the distance will you get out of your
car to investigate yes yes a well
there's a car by the side of the road

around whomever is out there do you
think you could pass me a hammer from
the toolbox and back she doesn't seem
too concerned with your sudden
appearance you spot an upgrade you could
use for your car in the back steal the
car upgrade and get her a hammer you
grab the car part before you get her the
camera thank you kindly she scoots out
from under the car she is younger than
you would have thought hey if you've got
a little bit of scrap I'm a real whiz
with cars I can fix her up for you give
her this crap to fix the wagon what what

big thing you can do big thing a candy

the Chet has a point we couldn't kill
any perfect I mean yeah I might listen
killing anyone is not out of the
question you know they would eat less
food yeah
okay good I did it I have I now have
tons of food okay I have no fuel
which is the tough part let's see if I
can trade someone for fuel I might have
to kill Kirkman sorry Kirkman yeah I
think Kirkman was turning into a zombie
rich okay did you do it yeah it's really
weird it's weird I don't know I don't
know what was happening I'm pretty sure
he was turning into a zombie so I had to
put him down
Kirkman wants to be buried all right I
got some fool I got some fuel let's
leave
sorry Kirkman but you were turning into
a zombie ed Witten gets shot by a stray
bullet guess who's next it's not going
very well rich Jack the zombie
apocalypse is bringing out the worst in
you if well I'm a realist a military
blockade impedes your progress by an
hour that's fine alright here we go here
we go
Oh ed Witten you're not looking too
great there but you're still alive so
that's something
someone in a zombie costume bites ed
Witten wait no that was a real zombie
stop stop you have a you have a zombie
well someone bit ed Witten guess what
that means goodbye ed Witten I got an
achievement for that it's rich really
like that how easy that decision was for
me all right I'm now out of fuel left
his mat yep
do you think he'll make it nope okay the
only one left is me motherfucker huh I
also didn't check the zombie activity
before I decided to yeah eat I go
hunting and they was a high
the zombie activity was high hello Draco
says you're making my decision look
better and better hey I did it
jet you only have 18 ammo mm-hmm I'd be
careful about shooting any of those
lobbies I found a bunch of food okay so
that's something nobody loves to eat the
food
no me and mall oh yeah to their fuel yes
no to their med kits for 26 of my yes
god damn it you idiot
that's right I'm a fucking dragon steals
from nice ladies shoots all those party
members mm-hmm
this is a true zombie game yeah and I'm
winning
Jack Jack has become the monster hmm
yes I am The Walking Dead I made it to
Albuquerque though that's pretty good
it's pretty good too the jobs are
bandits bandits
this bandits everywhere rich medkits and
food and few IED fuel I don't have any
money
okay how am i doing here how am i doing
the car is looking pretty good parties
looking decent supplies not gonna get me
very far I need that fuel all right
what's this bet you also badly need ammo
oh sure what's this some well what is
the bandit one I don't understand the
bandit one well like it's the Bandit job
I don't know what it is there are a
couple of troublemakers who have been
stealing from us dispose of them that's
where you're shooting at the guys in the
windows okay
I failed really quickly at that one yes
you did so I don't want to do that do
they have feet do they have ammo they do
have ammo I don't have any I don't have
any money I can see that so I might need
to do the job to get the money to get
more ammo but then that uses my ammo so
I think I'm just gonna say fuck it see
if anyone wants to trade anything spare
one of their fuel for 20 of my food yes
18 of their dollars two of your fuel no
because I'm not an idiot all right see
if anyone else wants to trade then we're
out of this fucking town no and I get
out of here let's go

ruse has led me to some food and that's
great
