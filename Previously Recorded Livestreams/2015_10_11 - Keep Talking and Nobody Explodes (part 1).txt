one green light one green light that's
kind of a reference for there are four
lights was the reference the card the
the episode the the two-parter where
he's captured by the croissants and
tortured oh yeah I forget the exact
number of lights but they want him to
say that there are five lights and
they're actually four they want to break
the car oh sure sure
so everybody we so you can probably see
what we're playing we're gonna play keep
talking and nobody explodes and we
actually had to print out the matt baume
manual I think I wish I wish you could
see this thing it's it's it's huge here
here I mean like like look at this thing
look at this thing it's huge like and we
had to print out the whole thing
it's like 23 pages it's huge
which is I mean it's too much I think
and so we have to like get it in order
which i think is going to be like part
of the actually something we we need to
do getting to business I know it's crazy
it's crazy town so what we need to do is
make sure that our voices are in sync
yeah so one of one of the mods tell us
if you can hear this I'm going to clap
tell us if our voices are in sync or if
we need to mess with the settings we we
checked it out is this the first time
this is the first time ever and it was
Rich's idea yom-yom and here it's fine
do it in sync I think he left over
beefcake i I think rich decided to get
the face cam because he finally watched
a different stream
oh my god facecam let's get a neat rich
for the first time in his life watched
of a live twitch stream it was like hey
that face cam technology that's pretty
rad outstanding actually watch somebody
streaming this game you know and and
like I admitted to rich that when I look
for people streaming games on Twitch I
usually pick people who have a face cam
yeah and I don't know why that is but
like in my head like they're more
trustworthy and we've just never had a
face cam because obviously we can't even
deal with playing games we're worried
about being a hassle because we can't
get anything right we're gonna find so
far right you're gonna you're gonna
start this shit look at this it's
amazing so I know very little about the
game and I only watched like a few hours
of streaming hours right
and so we're a little in the dark I'm
gonna be playing and what has to happen
here is rich is basically just gonna
turn away from the TV so he can't see it
right oh my god okay I am turned away
from the TV and my bald spot is clearly
visible oh my god look at that that's
amazing look at that you guys are
getting a one rich Evans bald spot
alright so I I am the bomb defusal
expert yeah and Jack will be trapped in
a room with a bomb yes okay let's see
yeah this game requires bomb defusal
manual version one to play please make
sure that you have the correct banjo

why oh you yes Oh Jason the Chad this is
what the hell is happening we're
defusing bombs here's here's how this
works if you're just tuning it right
sure yeah show them the manual yeah well
the screen that you are watching only
only one person is allowed to watch this
yeah Jack is watching it in this case he
can see the bomb and all of the
components on the bomb and he's in the
room with the bomb he needs to defuse
the bomb he needs me to help him defuse
the bomb yeah because I am the only one
who has and is allowed to look at the
bomb defusing manual which which has a
ton of different rules in it and so I
need to like describe the module to rich
and the bomb and he can't look at it so
we have to use teamwork it's insane
also Jay you might be confused as to why
you can see rich and I we're trying out
we're trying to have a face cam yeah
because before I thought oh you really
need for this game yeah because of how
frustrated we would be
each other yeah opposed you can see that
we're looking in different places yes
that's true that is true all right okay
no they're requesting that I have the
manual again
all right I think we're doing too well
the the chat requires some fail oh my oh
my god oh my god
Richard what's wrong with her proof room
okay okay okay okay
I am ready with the bum eye and I have
columns and rows all sorted out rich
I've never thought about it as columns
on a building before okay a hidden
message okay information to the obscures
and ways that are time-consuming to
decode in the world of bomb defusing
that's a bad thing
five minutes three modules three strikes
yeah when you enrich lanes all right he
disappears into the void okay I'm ready
I didn't I don't columns and rows is
hard to understand brain we don't need
those Simon Says Simon Says what I'm so
dead okay on the subject of Simon Says

contain a vowel yes
blue is flashing press red red okay blue
green wait no what blue and green are

ok alright I got three wires wires three
wires three wires what alarm clock what
oh Jesus Jesus three wires are there red
wires no no white blue black if there
are no red wires cut the second wire all
right great I got a Morse code fucking
thing here Morris : yeah Morris code is
a flat white okay the like I'm Hertz the
frequency thing under it okay okay yeah
I'm with you
what's that what's the frequency really
no it was at a daughter a - what I know
what's what I'm going to assume
dot dot dot dot dot thought that that is
H ok or dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot
dot dot dot dot I don't know what the
signal will loop with a long gap in
between so try to find the gap and and
start with one then just you know tell
me dot dot or - and then I'll tell you
the frequency I can't tell the
difference in atop a - fucked how can
you not tell the difference we're gonna
dine and dash the language dot dot dot
dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot
trying times dot me all of my guts try
3.50 53.5050 I don't need to do nothin
here great you need to learn yourself
some Morse code
III lived I lived great good ok
something is different these wires look
different to you this is bomb look
exploded to you what something's
different
mm-hmm
okay I'm ready Simon Says first all
right I got three wires three wires red
wires
yes ones red to or blue ones red to are

good okay
all right we got lights just went out
okay well I just just went out I can't
see what I'm doing I need away from the
lights to come back on we got some new
wires set up though some new wires yeah
one one roses there's wires one side
connected to the other this column says
one two and three and then the right
side of the screen is ABC so we got okay
red wire from one connected to be two
connected to a three connected the bead
look at each a wire on the LED above and
the space for the sodium free tour led
I'm gonna use a Venn diagram below to
decide whether or not to cut the wise
strips each wire may be stripped with
multiple colors
what stripped what I have no idea
are you on the wrong wires do we need a
battery I didn't we need bad area
identification do we have double a's or
a d battery double a's the boys great to
learn wait so how many oh I don't I
don't know there's there's there's only
three wires they're going from the left
side of the screen to the right side of
the screen then okay highly different
okay name describe the first wire
there's a wire from the slot labeled one
going in to be going in it's a red wire
from good one in to be okay
the bomb has two or more batteries it
will two doublea's cut it no crap what's
the color of that wire the one that I
cut was red okay what's the next where
it's black wires from two going into a I
was looking at the right wires I should
probably not there was there was a
complicated wire section that looked
like the one I was looking for but
subjective shit
shit yeah on the subject of complicated
wires look at each wire there is an LED
above the wire and a space for a star
symbol below the one oh not at all for
each wire and the wrong wires but you're
on the wrong wires there's no LEDs
there's no stars
there's no LEDs and there's no hours no
motherfucker I got one minute how many
wires you have there's this three okay
what if there are no red wires no there
wasn't red one I don't think this is the
old wires jack this is a new complicated
wire I don't have that wire fuck it by
Rama I'm hitting buttons no I don't have
that where diary Emma oh my god oh my
god I did what I had to do and I almost
made it back let me show you my so we
have the old wires yeah and then the
only other wire thing we have no wire
see that's the other wire thing we have
I don't see any other wire thing
disturbing we got a one two three ABC
where was that that is in the next page
that was that was on a nice page Jack I
almost did it on my own just guessing I
almost did it
gosh darn it Fleur bit her Fleur bit
