what about the new FTL guys game it's
not bad I don't think it's bad but
honestly just cannot actually kind of
forgot about it I'll tell you the truth
okay I have to kind of I've been playing
viscera cleanup detail
yeah it's just kind of it's it's it's
simple it's nice but it is just kind of
black unfortunately all right see how
this goes oh sure but and your earliest
convenience if you could turn the music
up it's all right in the game you have a
chat about cuz cuz that's how you roll
it is but we need a little background
noise thank you Jack you spent 30
minutes cleaning up your own bloody
footprints it's true and I found that
incredibly engaging yet I don't find the
same thing for into the breach which
should speak volumes about into the
breach or viscera cleanup detail either
one is ghost
breach is a perfectly competent game I'm
gonna take anger or hoping I get
something relic why's that plus its
strength for using three attacks sure
sure then you can just keep making anger
anger anger yeah yeah something psycho
your deck quickly good workout
what do you have what you have to do is
gather up all the guts and body parts
incinerated them ven mom yes I've
discovered that but you see they let me
discover that it wasn't it wasn't there
was no tutorial on how to properly clean
up everything it was a it was a joyful
gameplay moment of discoveries finding
the best way to claim finding the
perfect rhythm with the laser gun brings
up your bullet holes when I went back to
that first level and played it by myself
I got a tiara sorry 96% clean 96 percent
clean and part of me just thinks what
did I miss
what did I miss what could I have missed
man I don't think I can get behind
taking anger over flex I don't think
flexes that great I mean it's like was a
when you upgraded three or four for
extra strength for one term sure it can
pair well with something it can pair
well with certain cards let's say let's
say you get get five cards in your hand
yeah you get flex two shields and two
strikes and you're only getting like a
little bit extra on those tools yeah but
it's a you know what it works cuz it's a
free card for me it's a free card but I
go scar wings arc says flex is good to
make a good deck better but it doesn't
start a deck okay and that's a good way
to put it you can't build a deck off of
flex
but like something like flex with anger
could potentially work well as long as
you could get cycle your cards and draw
more cards because remember just having
flex in your hand means that something
else isn't in your hand
oh no this game again this game's great
this game is great I don't know what's
wrong with you man
okay good get you get out of town get
right on this game's great oh that
wouldn't help I wouldn't have helped me
oh that's a great price which ones you
get the cycle through your deck really
quick draw three cards oh yeah yeah
nothing yeah yeah that's a great one
that'll work that'll work great with
anger now you got something I need
something to give that anchor more
purpose I have a this is just a complete
dice roll if I find a relic that'll work
nice with it yeah let me need if that
works is what I'm doing yeah s in 1984
says hey rich and Jack do any of you
play clash royale for smartphones it's a
3d card game where you place units on
the map and destroy a player's Tower to
win then playing it every day for two
years in a row nope nope sorry
you won't like did you tard French guy
for this great guy yeah that that wasn't
necessarily you know hypothetical
someone else who clash royale doesn't
necessarily have the vigorous fan base
that fan base that say Lord of the Ring
has
smooth just so try that's how I describe
the Lord of the Rings movies dry I think
that's accurate but I still like them
you find them you fight your fine to
like them I think like you know what you
said where they're generic fantasy is
true but it was also the thing that
invented generic fantasy and so you have
to kind of give it that that's fine I
just I've never been big on generic
fantasy right all right listen
gaaah brands and ogres and yeah
how do I feel about Dave Chappelle he's
a very funny comedian Rach how do you
feel about Dave Chappelle it's fine okay
I have no strong feelings in Dave
Chappelle all right I have not seen
either of his new stand-up specials but
I have seen him perform live and I've
seen many of his stand-up specials and I
think he's very funny I know he famously
left his own show and he may be a crazy
man yes and famously left is very
successful yes I did success yes for
reasons I don't fully understand but
obviously he didn't but I do think he's
a very talented stand-up comedian oh god
those days
oh dude dude dude 28th dress as curious
why don't you guys have premium content
for patreon subscribers because rich and
I don't have a patreon like $5 a month
gets access to special videos reviews
etc it seems like you could make good
money from that which and I don't have
anything to do we don't have a patreon
for previously recorded and that's
that's uh that's a question that's above
our pay grade man question for someone
else
yes let's fire
crocodile brain says Jesus stream tips
sucks so badly
inside the twitch Android app I'm very
sorry crocodile brain
anyways rich any dirt not liking Lord of
the Rings for being generic is like not
liking Halloween because it's too cliche
or or or how about this it's like not
liking rice cakes because they're too
bland the rice cakes might have invented
the low calorie snack food I just don't
care about that they're not terrible I
don't hate the movies oh those are the
ringtones all I just don't get excited
about them they're there they happened
rich now by the way spoiler alert
that's what Project Hornet is its riches
epic 8-hour teardown of the entire Lord
of the Rings trilogy we've been editing
it for years rich has been working on
the script for his epic Lord of the
Rings teardown oh you guys he speaks
truth
well you want a hangar right I'm not I'm
not I'm not feeling it
no I'm not feeling it it doesn't
necessarily work run is gonna be a
disaster
hey sow disaster yet
I think pontiff pilot puts it very
quickly he says if people understood the
concept of personal taste all of these
arguments would never happen I know it's
crazy I know it's okay that rich doesn't
know it's it's absolutely not because
they need me to love Lord of the Rings
exactly as much or more than they love
the Lord of the Rings I think that's
what they really want they really want
like like I really like Lord of the
Rings and they want you to be a super
nerd about larger rings absolutely so
anyway anyway rich any Dark Souls 3 tips
nope No
ji Schatz says rich Jack just saw the
rlm a review of Freddy got fingered was
wondering what's your quick opinion of
the film thanks for the stream I haven't
seen it either vine that was an extra
quick because this film called Freddy
got fingered starring started do you
guys know who Tom Green is there's more
Mike's thing than my thing is amusing
for a little while and then Tom Green
check out old neighbor mm-hmm
apparently Mike thinks it's secret art I
think all of what Tom Green does is see
is not secret art it's just plain art
that's Tom Green's whole thing's he's
he's purposefully absurd that doesn't
necessarily mean I want to see a movie
about it maybe one day I'll see we got
it we have a tip from Jack underscore
Packard
who says I'm Jack
that is not me I did not secretly tip
myself that wouldn't make any sense I
know that wouldn't I know that what I
would lose money I'm having an identity
crisis
it's Jack from one second in the past or
one second in the future we don't know
I get the first boss already know oh
yeah
any thoughts in the dune movie remake
it's being made by the guy who did the
new Blade Runner and the southern movies
animal what a rival and and I like his
movies so I think it's gonna be good
because he makes good movies probably
sure it's good movies quick Jack's house
something only the real you would know
that I'm in 3 is a perfect movie not
even someone only only Jack would say
that even someone pretending to be me
wouldn't go that far
they would draw the line Niko hyoeun man
3 really like oh you're not the real
Jack Iron Man 3 is a perfect moment boom
perfect action movie maybe you're not
Jack it's a perfect movie you say no no
no Jack cuz you're not the real Jack I
know you know the real Jack now Jack
says it's a perfect action movie these
are your Anna posture
I'm an imposter the caveat is that
because real Jack just tipped us but
it's an action movie so therefore it's a
perfect movie because it's a perfect
action movie it all makes it's all the
same stuff it's awesome stuff or maybe
you're right I gotta go I gotta go now
for no reason for no reason whatsoever I
gotta go
and a Sly Jack 22 says here yes thank
you for the tip we appreciate it
Jack thinks the witch has a happy ending
so there's that it does if you anyone
who has seen the lovage understands that
it's a happy ending
ice I will stand by that I will stand by
that anyone's gonna read and ladybird is
also a perfect movie yes to perfect
movies lady ladybird ladybird Academy
award-nominated ladybird I thought
you're talking about ladybugs look the
Rodney Dangerfield movie where he takes
a 12 year old kid puts him in drag and
has him join a woman's soccer team I
legitimately thought that's what you
said ladybugs is also that's perfect
dribble says she becomes a self-centered
psychopath what's happy about that DRAM
Bowl did not understand the wish and
that's a darn shame and that's a darn
shame very sorry about that ramble maybe
give it another go maybe give that movie
another go you can do it you can figure
it out
all right
we're surviving I'm not I'm not liking
this deck maybe explain your thesis
Bianca so you're gonna be my restart
yeah I everything else is setup wrong of
him that he is barricade em everything
yeah it is so I the which is about the
stigmas and pressures placed upon young
women not give me any shields bricks do
you have a barricade no you don't look
very good and you know we the movie
starts I'm gone mmm I'm about to spoil
the witch for anyone who hasn't seen it
because I'd like to explain my thesis on
why the witch has a happy ending
heads up I'm about to explain the witch
right now so I think the the moral of
the witch story nice is is is about
these stigmas and pressures put on young
women especially at the time you know
she is thrust into a motherly role
watching the baby she's overly
sexualized by her brother she is thrust
into a parental role with her other
younger siblings she her mother acts
jealously towards her about her father
it's it's all sort of really messed up
and so the the ending of the movie as I
read it was her finally so all the all
of these stigmas didn't bring that back
a little bit all of these stigmas were
put on her as those which which is
basically a young girl turning into a
woman
the stigmas of womanhood as though the
which is the evilness of women hood and
the ending of the movie where she
discovers that she is a witch meets a
coven in the forest and ascends in a
witch Li cackle like literally starts
flying in the air cackling like a witch
to me was her accepting her role as a
woman therefore it's a happy I'm talking
about the wind really what ah it's not
gonna give me that
I'm talking about the witch I'm talking
about the movie the witch and so you
know you can look at black Phillip
representing you know the possibly a
partner you know like the male partner
he awakens her as a fully realized woman
you know the the boyfriend or whatever
bad influence good in this case I think
a good influence someone who who shows
her a world outside of her home so black
black Phillips black Phillip was a man
right exactly
hey Bock chihak damn black Phillips was
the one that showed her world outside of
her own a world of abuse and depression
so anyway
anyway that's my take on the witch and
that's why I think the witch has a happy
ending
the which in the beginning killed and
ate a baby they're not good with people
so again going along the theme that
movies trying to say that women aren't
good people or if we're going along the
theme of the of witches being
independent women and and a stigma put
on independent women is birth control
okay and that might lead that might go
along with that theme and so the witch
I mean kills the baby obviously it's a
horror movie so you got to have some
killing but birth control something
that's a stigma for for grown-ass
independent woman might work on anyway
love ovitch I think it's great
you want to forget about the witch you
want to hear my interpretation of the
village okay it's a dumbass movie boom
done
next it's a dumb movie that's so dumb we
were trying to think of the dumbest way
it could end and we predicted it as I
was watching the village with Lisa we
were trying to predict the dumbest twist
it could end with and we nailed it and
we were so upset just because it's
really good
don't be scared little wife
I'm not gonna get past this
me and Eamonn I liked it I like banana
Dean I thought it was a really
interesting movie no you're not gonna
make it why do I say the buffets because
it's silly that's it because in their
marketing they wrote the W is to upper
case B's which is how they did it back
in the day but I just think it's silly
yeah neon demon I thought was really
cool I thought it was it was an
interesting an interesting take survive
one more round
the only way to be independent is to be
an amoral monster or you're perceived as
an amoral monster and actually you're
not
damn think by think about is about
people's perception deal
I liked all of Nambiar even Keanu I
liked every little bit in the Ondina I
can't believe you won how about that
never give up congratulations
yeah
yeah God all the boss relics are garbage
no I'm sorry absolute game three curses
in three Rowling's well of course I
don't want to do that
you're gonna limp this one out yeah all
right yeah this is this is we're doing
it okay we're doing it or not we're
doing it or we're not all right that's
fun
what did I think of surrogates is
surrogates the movie with
what's-his-name Bruce Willis where they
have the give me the fucking Breuer Kate
he's not doing it attack it's the
perfect time she's brown game you're not
giving me parenting you have you have
you have 20 cards not the one who okayed
Bruce Willis then they have all the
doubles I think it's an interesting
premise and could have used a bigger
budget very interesting for mr. I liked
it I liked a lot of it good good good
sci-fi social commentary
good good b-movie that's exactly what
surrogates is classic sci-fi b-movie
we threw a trap fine fine I'm having
some shitty fucking luck in this game
yeah yeah what other things shape of
water I didn't much care for the shape
of water shaped like water who we saved
like water the shape wore the shape and
water yeah
shaped like water who we shave like
water the shape of water the water was
shaped like water the water was shaped
like what do you think well that would
be an interesting take on it I thought
there was I thought there was a lot of
good to the shape of water but overall
overall I think the shape of water
didn't do what it needed to do which was
explained why that lady wanted to fuck a
fish that's it that's all the movie
needed to do is why is this lady fuck
into fish and they didn't do that and
they did a lot of really good work with
other side characters everybody has a an
interesting character moment I liked the
look of the movie the monster I was
obviously very nice but they did not
explain why that lady one of the fuck
officials do you need a reason yes yes
you need a reason why a little box of
fish I'd say that's a fair expectation
don't you think don't you think I can't
I came out of that movie and I really
thought I missed something
I was I was visibly upset and I was like
what what did I miss and I'm talking I
went I saw it with Lisa I was like - did
you get it did you get it did you get
the movie and she's like yeah mate oh
good okay yeah you got you
our Miller I don't think that was it I
don't think they were both misunderstood
because they never show that fur for our
main character they never showed her as
a misunderstood outcast because she has
a group of friends who she talks with
and bonds with all the time who seemed
to accept her for who she is as a person
so
the back of the box has a poetic love
story about misunderstood creatures
right but then I think they did a bad
job of showing that she was
misunderstood because she had like
friends and you know that's it
so I think I think they did a poor job
showing why I'm showing her as an
outcast showing where someone who wanted
to fuck a fish and then she fucked a
fish and I'm just gonna keep saying fuck
a fish this is our worst this is our
worst dream ever how long have we been
talking about fucking two goddamn fish
20 minutes how long can you talk about
fucking a goddamn fish
how long can i yeah hours now you I mean
just people in general how we've been I
don't
the movie won the fucking Academy Award
for Best Picture rich we're gonna be
talking about fish fucking for a while
okay no actually if if past winners of
Best Picture are anything to go off of
people are already stopping talking
about
I'm all Radko so I wrote my dissertation
on fish fucking maybe they're a marine
biologist maybe well maybe Marco
actually like you know oh I actually
we're going repopulating the salmon
population of Northern Iowa Mall
radicals the only one authorized exactly
a mile rank oh you tell me about fish
market fish biologists is allowed we
talk to me about fish fucking and the
importance of fish fucking will write a
movie about that it'll be great you know
we'll give a character has a reason fuk
fish Scott I get that I got that and I
thought that was really lame I'm not
gonna spoil that for anyone
Scott nine more than five seven seven
five I'm trying not to spoil it I'm
trying not to spoil out a fish fucking
movie because people might not have seen

Rings movies that much that was it
you didn't even say you disliked them

they're kind of dry that's good they're
not my favorite things which by the way
is a completely fair argument come on
people get it together
I'm ants and you know what I just made a
joke about Das Boot and now people are
giving me shit about Das Boot it's an
obscure arthouse movie no it's not an
art housemate I know it's an obscure
movie only art house people know is I
guess the better way to put that it's
not I wouldn't know if I'd call that an
art house movie but
oh this one's gonna be a disaster it's
pretty obscure I would I would call
Dawson I would I would say if you were
to pull a hundred people off the street
less than ten would know about Das Boot
these days yeah Rama to came out what it
was in the Oscars or maybe all right
maybe

season starts off it's like what's the
big deal and then it just starts getting
darker and darker and darker it's good
to get gets really like some really
black comedy no Jan horseman hmm
he's a miserable horse man it's a
miserable horse man I like Bojack
horseman more than I like Lord of the
Rings oh you've just made some people
have very happy and some people very
upset and you've made some people very
confused because they like both and you
agree with part of the things that they
are but not all of the things that they
are okay let's uh let's alt tab over and
read the names of the people who have
subscribed to us during this stream
there's a bail King I think bulking
