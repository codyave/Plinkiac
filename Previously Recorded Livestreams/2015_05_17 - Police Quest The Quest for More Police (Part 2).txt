as you look into the car you wonder can
this be happening what you gonna do to
get out of his ticket the young lady has
a smile that could note the police now
polar ice caps beautiful flashing eyes
gorgeous hair and her unbuttoned blouse
makes it obvious she has nothing died
shit oh look he's blinking yes damn her
what did I do wrong officer she says
showing her best smile I'm truly sorry
sir I honestly did not even see that red
light is there anything I can do to
convince you to let me off and I do mean
anything I mean we asked for blowjob
right
what's a blow to honey don't oh I know I
am yeah well how what that's what it
takes I suppose it's all right you
quickly trade your integrity for a
shagging and Turin sex
a phone number is 5 5 5 4 3 6 9 she says
with a smile give me a call sometime I
mean what do we do do we let her off
that I wrote down their phone number she
sounds very grateful she says thank you
officer
please call me and soon did you write
down the phone I did write down the
phone number but is that gonna be a fail
stable yeah I am going to assume yes
yeah but we're going back to the coffee
shop with the phone to see if we get see
if we can decide yeah cuz I'm sure
that's gonna have her that's great see
you later
you know what I'm probably gonna fail as
soon as I Drive off hello hots that's
great you just think that broads days
yeah great give it a coffee-shop go
what Oh fuck's sake oh you wouldn't do
it
yeah that's bullshit
yeah you have to see what happens if we
if we get to have sex with her man
nice job studly okay so my really quick
riveting had story yeah is that trying
to go we have we have in my neighborhood
a legit haberdashery a place that sells
fancy hats and I need a hat for my bald
head not just like a baseball cap I need
a hat with a brim mm-hmm
because if I'm outside I get a sunburn
yeah that's just think I need to add and
I'm going on another trip this week
and I need a hat or else I'm gonna get
sunburned on my head and a ton of people
were out walking in the neighborhood
today and the stupid hat shop was closed
said well how can you how can you be
closed I'm already walking around I was
really upset and so now I won't have a
chance to go hat shopping I don't think
I want a fedora like I was gonna look at
trail B's just cuz they have brims this
is not I mean you know like a fedora for
anyone who doesn't know this is the
advantage owns hat
yeah wide brim it would make more sense
for me because it would cover the most
real estate I don't know if it'd look
good for me but I was looking at trail
B's look at Epidaurus
or else I'm just gonna say fucking wear
a baseball cap if I could get away with
it I'd wear like one of those like
Arabian night like not a turban thing
but just like the thing that covers your
head and drapes over the back of your
neck neck but I can't get away with that
because I would look ridiculous if I
could get away with it I would get a
fucking parasol I wear a parasol or walk
around with a parasol every day but I
can't yeah in any case hey Dad
I don't think I had it would look good
on me and so I need to go hat shopping
with I'm gonna remember that one of
these days that I don't have do you know

wife to make sure I don't look

ask her to sign ticket Oh Oh God
she hands your ticket book back it's
just with a sarcastic smile why don't
you shove that pen where the Sun don't
shine
officer mommy and daddy really
what's that mommy and daddy and
therefore I don't understand what what
so did you say what
okay levels of enforcement level one
firm professional conducts situation a
person shows passive verbal resistance
usually on a routine stops use firm
professional conduct in most cases this
will prevent the situation from
escalating be refrained from abusive
language or threats it will only
escalate the situation level two
hand-to-hand combat
she verbally pounds you again officer
did your mother have any children that
lived
that's a weird insult she's saying I'm
dead
that's the insult that's weird okay next
yeah next time she gives us a stove
we're going straight to hand-to-hand
combat I'll tell you that let's get the
fudge out of here shoot cans that's
great all right let's arrange the young
woman shrieks as you drive off your mama
wears army boots you bleep head

think this is written by a former
policeman oh yeah okay well we did it we
we did it we did our first traffic stop

have been sitting around for a while I
actually thought Jack brought those in
once when we filmed that Avengers half
in the bag as we had our we brought in
our video game ship for the set sure I
thought those are just jacks games that
he brought in so no yeah they've been
sitting around I thank you thank you and
apparently the guys when they open the
mail never bother to tell us that you
sent that wonderful gift but thank you
alright
and and I might have to go backhand J
and Mike for another reason anyone who
watched our Avengers episode yeah might
have noticed a little something missing
from the fucking credits oh really like
you know someone who was in the episode
might not have been credited in the end
of the in the avengers episode okay
you're gonna love the one that just did
from that max where they start off the
episode by insulting us he went the foul
on a bald one you know what that was
funny
yeah but uh they forgot my credit in the
avengers episode
it's Jay's fault I talked to Jay about
it we will not be talking about
fury road for one I don't think jack is
seated and Jack is wrong tonight I've
seen it for another one I don't want I
don't want to spoilers I'm just gonna
say it's it's fucking amazing the movies
fucking amazing it's the best time I've
had watching a movie in forever and a
day yeah yes yeah it's some good shit
what oh I was just looking someone asked
where my mic was and it looks like my
level is weird you didn't touch that at
all no okay I'm here okay respond to a
complaint at Kara Oh Carole's caffeine
castle great place comes up a lot I did
think making fun of us in the newest
half of the bag was very funny
I was accredited for the Avengers up so
Jay just copy and pasted the credits
from the previous episode not thinking
to add me to it this is also not the
first time they've left me out of the
credits of an episode but you know what
it's fine everything's fine everything's
fine I backhanded the Jay I'm rich
crashed his please just say I need to be
a bit more generous in driving
yeah Jay you're a J copy and pasted the
credits which happens when you're when
you're trying to do things quickly and
he feels really bad about it and I made
him feel bad about it for for a while
before saying he was okay but Jay also
left me out of the credits for the
episode where I was mailman Tommy and
I've never forgiven him for that as that
was an acting role
you know like when he opens the door
gets out of the car I really want to see
her a Robocop game done in the style
Sierra's the sound effects could be a
little clump when you walk a striker I
agree with that
Avengers being kind of mid tier Marvel
Cinematic Universe link entertaining but
yeah overall it'll it's it's a bridge
it's not the climax it's a bridge it's
fine if you're into the cinematic
universe it's a fine addition but but
yeah it's not it's not what the first
ventures was oh oh sunny those drunken
bikers in the bar next door taken up all
the parking really taking all the
parking places they're part of my cafe
they just have no consideration for
others where my customers gonna park
would you ask them to move their
motorcycles please great another chapter
in your life of big-time crime stopping
parking space Hawking honestly why is
she so upset about this I've radioed in
do you have your nightstick with you yes
I'm pretty sure I can grab that out of
the car double-check why so many in the
chat single going do you need it no I'm
looking up the levels of enforcement
level twos head-to-head combat okay
and it says you might have to use your
nightstick so level one is what this is
gonna come up these guys aren't gonna
want to move their bikes we know this
use firm Professional Conduct in most
cases this will prevent the situation
from escalating refrain from abusive
language or threats okay level 2a
suspects threat indicates imminent
physical attacked no weapons visible
call for backup unit if possible use
Department approved hand-to-hand combat
if appropriate used PR 24 nightstick
okay level three deadly force we won't
get
yeah probably not probably as he heads
for the back room the bartender mumbles
under his breath here comes trouble
oh the we are so hand-to-hand combat
lots of blood sweat and tears and other
things have been deposited in wino
willies leader or this bunch comes over
you and says well well if it ain't the
tidy-bowl man
well well if it ain't the chattable man
go there you go
what the bleep do you want Bianca oh
shit dog
asked to tell firm voice right firm
professional conduct man - wolf bike
what's the total all right ask man to
move Miz no bike bike talk to man the
animal in the black leather jacket says
we don't talk to no pigs I think we
should go with leftover beefcake
suggestion of Dead or Alive you're
coming with me
this ain't the kind of place would do
good as chump man top no pants ready of
a backup if non-compliant let's see here
person shows okay level one the firm
Professional Conduct a person shows
passive verbal resistance usually under
routine slaps do use firm professional
comic oh we do look at girl wait say the
kind of lizard yeah you said very look
at girl oh nothing special
well we did just pull over that hottie
in the question she's probably looking
look at her look at those friends you
can't really tell but she's probably all
saggy yep
in the back of a motorcycle probably at
15 she's done that she's done nothing
but like smoke for the last 30 years all
you're seeing is the flaps of leathery
clear alright how do we resolve this
take the darts away you want to take the
toys away
I mean they're playing darts not
listening to you let's see here we don't
tie he's just saying we don't talk to no
pigs right yeah it's like I think you
need to get in the way of their game
might get again there it's retarded I'm
gonna die when the dart hits me well
save
though
okay I mean so you're right but you save
you have been nailed by a four grimdark
tossed by a 250 pound biker good job
next time watch where you're walking
okay so I'm going right to the
nightstick yeah Eric off Rebecca yep yep
so you did that yep okay get out a
nightstick yeah let's fuck him up just
do that yourself okay
because we're not listening to you
oh wow where's handcuff procedure I
think we're at a handcuffed procedure
yet we need to get him talking demand
compliance don't what's the demand what
man are you talking do Batman by her
head drink well no you can't do that
god the server in a real world we just
beat the shit out of this man right he's
coming right for me living shit
type in he's coming right for me okay
someone has a good suggestions which is
a go outside and check search their bike
sounds that sounds fine that's a
reasonable thing did you radio for
backup
yeah okay I mean in this safe I did that
when I walked in okay sorry
oh you died October bikes I can't be
good
no no your yeah I mean you're fucking
dead or is that what you're supposed to
do I doubt it
and now you can fight him maybe maybe
here we go here we go
it's happening it's all happening Todd
and bold man it's hell
what's the tale see here let's see what
we got here
let's see let's say let's try well
should I go I'm do the bike knocking
over can you wonder they're not back no
vibra strong again Oh move bikes
can you just say move bikes hold up hold
up
I thought the gun is the solution I know
I can draw the gun but I doubt we're
going right to shooting people
yeah they're just like parts like
illegally Oh
Oh No run plates how do that inspect
plates fun because we there's a
motorcycle missing Oh check the VIN
numbers yeah my momma yeah momma
what's a yeah my mom no just bad news no
no all right all right
read plates was read
no no all right now this
set fire to bikes I don't think I don't
think that would help I think I think I
like the suggestion of just telling you
know like get darts oh god he's still
shooting oh wait wait
the best way to play darts is to save
your game turn off your computer and buy
a dart board maybe you'll get to play
darts in please cause - oh I think so
much to play deterrents
I just want to interrupt their game yeah
I think that's the smart an idea that's
why I wanted you again there I talk to
the bartender bartender win him back
type in move bikes Steve was he gonna do
physically move all four bicycles no no
I mean go up to the man and Oh cuz
that's a firm way instead of asking him
to move bikes you just say move bikes
okay
just see if that works dynamo man him I
like that I like that
how'd he plan on making us yeah good
work jack good well that wasn't me that
was the chat that was 100% the chat Oh
say good night Pig yeah whoo and take a
defensive stance the head biker quickly
backs down saying excuse us if you're
gonna be rough with us well we'll just
leave quietly nice

feeling so good nope nope male suspects
must be handcuffed behind the back not
whining sick a chance you explain I'm
sorry sir but departmental policy
dictates all custody arrests shall be
restrained by proper handcuffing
procedure and that means behind your
back women suspects may be handcuffed in
front at your discretion

interesting you place your shut your
subject under arrest for the violation
of Lippmann's City vehicle code VC two
three five zero two driving while under

little head bobble suppose he can't open
the door on his father not open the back

wonder what's gonna happen but we're
going by the fucking book here all right
we did it rich
Oh God where do we take this guy to the
J Oh to the jail I know where the jail
is where's the jail who takes that car I
mean you use radio
oh yeah use radio that's a good idea
isn't somebody had to pick up the car
radio for tow truck I don't know nothing
said something about that what about my
car oh here we go
don't worry it'll be toned somewhere
safe in your expense right the jails way
at the bottom Oh save yes yes jails way
at the bottom 7th streets and River Road
which is the bottom road bottom like I
just along the bottom sent along the
bottom you know like the the last row
find it we'll find it the bottom road is
real open yeah it down even one more oh
god oh god oh god nice
I got eyes I got eyes it's that one
there is that one that big building I
never yep it's that big brick building
that's the jail cuz he probably have to
take him to the jail I can only assume
right well yeah the station didn't seem
like I had once alright yep City Jail
her already take him to the courthouse
usually I do
cuz there's the courthouse is right next
door hold on that's gotta be the channel
I mean well tell me to fuck off I guess
right let's see here look at
because the police station that did not
have like the facilities oh yeah here it
is Reid suspects his rights transport
prisoner to jail jail okay look around
II was the officers booking entrance to
the living city jail the exercise yard a
prisoner dribbles continuously he also
bosses is basketball oh that's right and
see that's racist
that's not stereotyping that's just
racist what is this look at Walker what
are those these lockers are used to
store officers weapons while they're
inside the jail on business how they go
that seems insane what if what if
somebody breaks out in like the jail
well it's in the locker it's locked in
the locker it better than that have them
take off take your weapon off you in a
jail I guess see Manos fate hands rich
feels the same way and I'm with rich
that typing is better than pointing and
clicking I also prefer typing it seems
to you use you know use a different part
of your brain yeah when you have to type
it out yeah it seems it seems more
natural it's it seems like more useful
think outside of the box rather than
just click on things looking at what you
what what can interact with yeah click
on does this interact with that notice
in Iraq no does this interact with no
yeah think about what you're doing and
why you're doing it which is what's
great about the Sierra game its what's
great about text event there's angry dog
I know I was trying to put away the
nightstick it said it had to go in the
car Oh does it well I might be okay to
bring the nightstick inside let me talk

a buzzer looks like a buzzer by the door
look at look at look at ya and that's
right Johnny beam no ho like in a point
and click game you can just like
randomly click on the screen until
eventually you click on something that's
click honorable you know here you add
the prisoner it's all in your mind yes
with a sex adventure yes there's no
there's no cheating the system yes

trivia question the first game ever
streamed on this channel exposed
genitals is Laura enters the jail and
says hey Sonny I need to speak with you
for a moment
Oh Oh promotion the musician is open in
the Narcotics Division
and according to the lieutenant Morgan
it will be filled by a veteran street
cop if you're interested submit a memo
to lieutenant Morgan as soon as possible
it would be a great chance for you to
get out of that uniform for a while just
as Lauren leaves the jailer
yells out at you hey hot pencil will
come over here I just hung up from
talking to Dooley
and is he hot jailer continues he wants
you back at the office on the double no
none of you remember sonic was our first
official stream like that's the first
thing you tested something the first the
first game we all streamed together it
was our first official stream there was
a game that I streamed just to test out
streaming just to see if I could stream
mm-hmm and somebody saw it I know I
think people were talking to me I don't
remember what that was notice nobody's
gotten it so far what's it oh just a
case I'm right I'm not gonna say
it wasn't no it wasn't binding of issac
wasn't darksouls wasn't Sonic right that
was the first official stream but I
asked what the first game played on this
channel was no wasn't mspaint wasn't tf2
wasn't any of these things I streamed a
game nope not risk of rain none of these
things someone was around might not have
been anybody who's actually here right
right I I want to say people were people
were talking to me and I'm sure I'm sure
it's I mean it's been long since deleted
from the channel because you know they
delete him after so long and I didn't I
didn't highlight it because you know
it's just basically a test stream but I
did play for awhile and if you guys are
just like guessing games that we've
played before I can tell you this we've
never replayed the game that I first
dreamed did you save
oh rich yeah you forgot your gun did you
forget your gun at the jail yes I did
okay yes it did Thank You SPO Jean oh
thank you thank you thank you for a
reminder
no I'm not gonna tell I'm not gonna tell
you what game because this is you know
what if we do like a like a trivia
contest or something this is the one
question then well I'm thinking about it
what jarvik and elfin cure bum longer
thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it that is all days off oh
but I all tab the game didn't
oh you've crashed him dead well you say
it that's good no it wasn't it wasn't
Power Stone and by the way there were
people at that stream because I tweeted
that I was testing with our previously
recorded Twitter and some people showed
up there were people watching and I was
chatting with them we did it
but but I'll save this I'll save this as
a unknown trivia question we don't want
to okay we don't want to give this away
this is this will be valid trivia
question if someone can figure it out we
almost Chippendales for us two Rangers
Jimenez no I do I actually don't know
I'm chip and dale rescue rangers like
extra copies all the time I mean I
forgot about that game I probably lied
to you why yes I'm a compulsive liar
yes killer mix bunk it was the last of
us you're right that was the first game
I've ever not Pokemon okay so we got the
drunk driver
mmm-hmm it was not hard driving I don't
know what that is that's a neat little
driving game actually
oh I think it's the exact same game as
stunts and stunts is a great game where
you can make your own courses in 3d and
drive them around oh cool as crash cars
I'm trying to think of an appropriate
hint well don't give a hint if it's
gonna be a trivia thing down the road
right signer I don't know what game it
is so oh here's a fork okay here 24 is
the nightstick right I suppose
wait what you need your peer 24 mm I
freeze that though yes I didn't I did
not highlight the sonic stream so we
lost the sonic stream but some people
did record it and the sonic stream is on
our YouTube channel for anyone who wants
to watch it okay I'm not gonna hit you
people are asking me not to hit you so
I'm not gonna hit you

yes the P over 24 is your nightstick
holster doesn't work I put away put away
I tried that put alot but a watt it was
not crazy taxi well I do that because
you told me to I just dropped it
apparently I dropped it right in the
hole oh well that's great
at least now I know where it is
here's a question do you suppose like a
walk out in the traffic do you think
this by the way there are some like
there are some problems with texts games
like that yeah you have to you know you
have to be very specific we're gonna
talk to chief what's-his-face
do-do-do-do-do
hmm
oh my guys I'm trying to search I'm
trying to do a Google search for the
first game stream down this channel to
see if I can figure it out so give me a
moment
I'm searching
it's getting very quiet in here
my god these people are all following me
oh my god
they are are you talking to them her I
don't know no look at Dooley the van has
gone berserk
I thought that new desk decoration was
rather comical what I don't know honey
you should have seen sergeant Dooley
when he first discovered that chicken he
threw screaming fit and wanted the
lieutenant to dust for prints what
somebody's probably played a prank oh oh
okay take a look in my office scene
maybe you can shed some light as to how
that creature made his way to the top of
my desk
ah yes oh my god oh my god you can
hardly believe your eyes a full-grown
chicken with its legs tied together is
flapping about and clucking raucously
right on sir Julie's desk brothers fly
everywhere but that's not the worst
unfortunately the chicken has lost
control of her bodily functions that the
mysterious gremlin has truck sergeant
Dooley again
sunny if I find out you are that
inconsiderate worthless gremlin I'll
hang you out to dry look at that chicken
okay here's a couple of you have figured
it out
I played a plug-and-play amazing
spider-man game it's one of those like
ten dollar games that you can buy at
Walmart that plugs there is a controller
that plugs directly into your TV and
it's called the amazing spider-man they
figured it out through my Twitter so yes
it was the amazing spider-man plug-in
play controller game that was the very
first game stream to this channel we
might have to play it again you know
yeah to me to make the circle complete
it's actually like I mean it's it's it's
not a great game but it's shockingly for
just being one of those plug-in plays is
pretty good it was amazing
oh yeah you didn't think to like I my
hahaha draw gun shoot chicken I just
thinking about it
wait do you have to get the chicken off
his desk I mean it's close to midnight
yeah save it at the chicken draw gun you
know
please review proper gun handling
procedures and your LPD please VA's
indoctrination guide okay so you
probably can't you can only use deadly
force in self-defense
can you grab chicken now you don't want
to do that who dirty their clean uniform
we're picking up a chicken that just
relieved herself all of her surgeon is
god damn it fried chicken you did
fucking Kay
fuckin k anybody anybody subscribers Oh
at the with rich ruining the joke freeze
before I could oh you should ask the
chicken for a blowjob back okay great
back we're gonna save alright anything I
want to say thank you guys for coming
out I thought this was a really fun
stream I can't wait to finish up police
quest I think this is a really neat game
by the way yeah the the way you have to
actually like follow specific procedures
I think is really
