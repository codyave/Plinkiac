yeah fucking I'm starting early today
jack will be here later uh I'll write
about some probably probably before 8:00
somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00 is
Jack's ETA and Here I am at the studio
and rather than um don't kill an hour
and a half two hours waiting what is it
already seven all right you like an hour
waiting I'm just gonna start early this
whatever
all right don't fullscreen you're
probably saying fullscreen but I'm not
saying this great I'm saying a window
about fuck you fuck you game
city the opening cutscene enjoy it
it is known that the world fell and the
most people in it died
the dead will not suffer the hardships
of a terrible world which reminds those
born into this l have no remembrance of
anything else those who survived those
that are truly broken they know
what was before
how's everyone doing tonight yeah I'm
sorry from the start it's funded I'm
actually testing out the feasibility of
someday doing a no depth from because I
like no deference I find them
challenging I find them fun and I'm
gonna try and level up quickly I have my
safe backed up
right
Jack will be by in about an hour I think
puts his kids to bed what no I'm sure
he'll be by okay then where I was here
rather than waiting around and you just
start the stream now why would I was one
such man one who had lost and and to
this he had lost his sanity his was a
never ending journey away from the
phantoms of his past he believed he
could silence the cacophony in his mind
and find peace beyond a place he called
the plains of silence he now had the
vehicle the weapons the provisions in
the fortitude that he only needed a few
and here there was but one place to go
technically I guess it's a movie tie-in
game because it's a movie franchise but
really has that much to do with the
movie and I got licensing the franchise
more so than making a movie tie-in
maxi's ripped chata sir oh yeah if you
survive the apocalypse you're probably
gonna end up being ripped I don't I
don't think the apocalypse is gonna be
littered with fat people
that people will be food for the
survivors
won't somebody tell me answer it
how did how did scrotus survive that
both the one video game logic movie live
fiction it's worth of fiction and you'd
be surprised what the brain can survive
I mean there there have been people
who've been impaled through the skull
with a number of ridiculously large
objects that have lived I mean one of
the the piers for epilepsy is they
remove half your brain or at the very
least they they they cut the connecting
tissue between the two halves of your
brain which is basically what just
happened to that guy scrotus it looks
comical but I think technically
technically survivable you probably need
better medical care right afterwards
than the Mad Max world is capable of
providing you still
this is kind of weird I'm used to
playing this I'm pretty pretty much any
game in my PC with a logitech a Logitech
controller which is kind of a
PlayStation controller knock off right
now I'm playing with absolutely roids
xbox pad everything feels weird really
really weird
that Mad Max versus Big Boss well I
think Mad Max is technically undefeated
big boss well it's at some point he does
he does get beat by his janky-ass clone
like like twice so that would be in the
pre solid Metal Gear games before Solid
Snake was a clone of big boss strike I
know you'll find me and dismantle me no
no Chum buckets not stupid
dogs bleeding out I can fix it
but I do my best work in my sanctum of
the car I need wire to fix my buggy Dan
I can show you where they took the
black-on-black way to a phone boil up
that pack but before you go grab some
quick sake you must be running on fumes
does does that's not a metal gear solid
5 spoiler that's a a metal gear on the
nest spoiler that has nothing to do with
5 big boss has been around for 30 years
he was the villain in classic metal gear
yes you eat dog food like like in like
in the road warrior food
all right now I'm gonna try and level up
quickly like I said I'm kind of flying
around with seeing how feasible a ain't
no debt rose and I might try and level
up quick and I'm gonna take these early
fights pretty easy because I'm trying to
get the level up token for undefeated
straight for not taking any damage in
battle so I'm not I'm not even taking
many chances in this early section even
though I could probably deal with these
guys a lot more efficiently as far as
somebody earlier said this every game
need a prophecy I I think I think that
that the Hunchback the guide chumbucket
he's he's gotta nuts I don't think there
is prophecy
fatback's doesn't care because the guy's
willing to build him a car because he
thinks that's what the proxy wants me to
do
hey guys without taking any damage right
now with that that's six so I've gotta
find two more guys to kill without
taking any damage from anything
yeah I'm using a gamepad PC because this
is a game this is a gamepad centric game
I mean this is kind of free flow of
fighting built for a gamepad also
driving also better with a gamepad when
it comes to aiming I am I am Pro Mouse
why
Kojima basically said ignore the NES
Metal Gear games I think he meant been
Vaness one only is the nest one is a
terrible part of the the actual original
version of Metal Gear which was it on
the MSX or something weird but story
wise I think they're very much canon
Metal Gear Solid which is the only the
only 3d one I've played in full I think
takes place directly after the 2d metal
gears
my buggies just over here follow me
I seem to talk more naturally no then I
used to in solo streams on got a little
bit more experience but edit it's a
little bit less awkward though I'm
probably gonna start focusing on the
game at some point because I'm trying to
as early as I can I'm trying to get the
defeat eight guys in a fight without
losing any health then I'm gonna
instantly try and get to be twelve guys
in a fight without losing any health and
then I'm gonna parlay that right into
the beat fifteen guys that was any hope
I'm doing
so do I get my compact sooner I'll be on
love why well a man here we arrived in
time to save your back from spotter
yes therefore that looky-look boys he
may be able to spot your car did did
rich ever give his opinion of fury road
but you don't listen to many of her
streams then it gets salivated all over
that yes jack will be here later
it'll be on our normal nonsense
BRABUS always keeps the best parts of
himself you know but he's not here now
you see I I don't see the land okay I'm
getting my car back
wait is there an actor I would love to
see play Batman um no that man is
probably just stick to being animated I
don't I don't think anybody's ever gonna
top the DCAU Batman top how fast it's
that that Bruce Timm Paul Dini and Kevin
Conroy magic
good cover perfect nice to build a car
come yes much to show you what is this
place
yeah Sydney declare the pre 60
controller that's gonna it's totally
gonna fucking throw me off big deal
when you're ready Saint my holy hideout
awaits
come come on sing us a hallucination
you come true the angel made steer by
the fire that moves the piston by the
tranny on Ojai for the clam and the
u-joint blessed be her she lawyer's
office
you say no car it's just a missing parts
no knowledge from the numinous it's my
she wills herself upon this world look
person in shed this game really isn't
that linear I mean I'm I started from
scratches all the early parts miss
hearing tutorial ask type stuff after
this first century it's pretty much open
world stuff for testing Springs shocks
thanks story he's really not focused on
that much his story is build your car
open up new areas that's the story we
would officio my journey where it is
but what I like to see in a Mad Max
sequel I will leave that entirely up to
George Miller because that man knows
what he's doing and whatever any any
idea I could come up with for a Mad Max
sequel was 30 times stupider reason than
anything George Miller was business
probably has in store I don't even know
if you need water fury road is pretty
good you know hey you know what you do
besides doing another three-hour long
car chase which was amazing but my
answer is there there are smarter people
than me who can figure that out yes I
know this cans going to be empty but I
want to loot this area because it's
another you know looting looting areas
there's another thing that'll get me
another level up token
whoever was here is long gone now along
with anything of news every every ten of
those like accomplishments things you do
why and gain more damage more more
health she's out of gas
take it easy take it easy shouldn't be
three guys sir that's not good I
actually need that's the eighth guy and
I actually need to lose health before
it'll acknowledge that I beat eight guys
in a row I can't I can't I can't go from
eight directly into twelve which is
stupid jump on a fire that burned me no
no I won't burn me oh great now I gotta
lose health because normally there are
three dudes there no there's only two
that's obnoxious I can walk on fire I
can walk on fire that's not good damn
I gotta lose health before the next
fight
Hilary all the way to the rim praises
she's full but let's bring an extra
oh let us make haste before the nightly
hunters return ok fall off something
here I'm actually trying to take damage
now this is ridiculous
nope
look
no talking closer to it hopefully I
won't die there we go I'm to see
untouchable speed I know eight enemies
without taking damage now I can work on
the twelve enemies without damage that
was that was a joke that was those
comical
don't put it around so let's make this
one count
murder on sight
this is there a movie I would love doing
her own commentary track on a space cop
looking forward to that we're getting
there
attraction
so we're not used to a 360 pattern
their prize right for their taking go
quickly
oh holy way to get up there it's through
the hose cave tunnels
get the kind place down here I'll lower
the body onto it gas cans do not explode
well in fiction they do in fiction gas
always explodes that's just that's just
accepted that's it's the same thing
that's like shooting a car gas tank
makes a large explosion really not any
kind of reality just spills gas all over
the floor
that may or may not excite you probably
won't ignite back you know movie logic
we accept these things
still works too
am I looking forward to football season
no I'm not because I live in Wisconsin
and I hate Green Bay
so football season for me is horribly
obnoxious
especially when the Bears suck and
they're probably going to mid last
season another rebuilding again so fuck
football
now working that no damage thing again
ah fuck all right
try again with the next group of dudes
fuck you for starting early fuck you too
you missed out on me here alone not
talking about anything interesting play
my Maxim
I'm so sorry for Dec that's gonna show
up I don't know a Tish and it's gonna be
a full-on stream you'll be fine you'll
be fine
oh well
why is turning her Xbox controller
oh whoa up
head-on collision
oh yeah
too much nuki says the Xbox analog
sticks a notoriously but I thought the
Xbox controller was absolutely perfect
it needs repairs
you wanna know what I think of the game
I I like it I like quite a bit I got I
got a tie up I don't hate the middle
gear I'm not saying that but III want to
play this more than the new Metal Gear
this game has won the battle for my
heart Mad Max or Batman Arkham Knight
met max look other than the story
I don't think Knight is all that great
the car combat sucks I actually enjoy
the car stuff more in this game plus
it's more appropriate for the franchise
and even though this is take the Arkham
combat I think I think Arkham combat or
free-flow combat that's just the thing
now that's like I think I mentioned this
before on a stream like back in the the
middle to late 90s Doom clothes were a
thing first-person shooters were all
called gym class eventually it just
became its own genre I think that's
gonna happen with the free flow combat
I'm just gonna get used to that as its
own thing now and honestly the free flow
combat I mean it's different enough they
they managed to make it feel a bit more
brutal which is appropriate for max
hitting one guy in the face repeatedly
moreso than jumping all over the place
it's a little bit different
but I don't I don't think the Arkham
games can hold on to this is their thing
forever
it's it's just it's a thing now and we
we have to deal with that
I wouldn't want only Arkham combat 100%
of the time but if other games use it
okay if if as long as they can find ways
to put their own spin on it
got the jack
we're just scared it'll be easy with a
heart there yes first if we don't weaken
their numbers why it'll mean the end of
you me and the magnum opus all right
see those metal monsters slowest water
flies would have loved to mark their
turf bring them down for a good rally
Kadena jump front but it sure would
I'm going white he got to pick up that
scrap
did I ever play Halo one or the series
hero is a first-person shooter on a
console so you have to use a gamepad so
fuck halo yes I know halo 1 had a PC
port but none of the other games doing
some fucking I need that shit
first-person shooters with a pad fucking
awful fucking awful ridiculous control
scheme
fuck analogue FPS controls yes aiming
with a thumb stick fucking nightmare
it's like it's like it's like jogging
and fucking hip-deep molasses Oh
shooters where you can't use a mouse
terrible unless they've got auto and
then it's not even really a shooter
gamepad is an inferior tool for FPS
utterly inferior in every conceivable
way
it's like it's like eating soup with a
fork
let's say
gates defended war crier sniper out
front that's all
Tampa's live defenses I'll deal with
them before interim I I know you can
play in the first Halo on PC but say I
really liked it and I wanted to play the
sequel's and I can't because you have to
use a fucking game pad on the console
for every other Halo game so fuck that
I'm not doing it fucking
now
Thank You speech
amen
nope nope no I don't want to aim at the
Schmucks
I want to aim at the guy that's bluffing
room
what mess you got
now stop liking that record and fuck you
all right black black is gone they have
nothing
fuck the fuck d12 guys without taking
damage then gonna fucking fuck it all
fuck it all
well I well I have a good rich needs to
do this is a surprise secret no death
run like Dead Rising maybe maybe that's
what I'm testing the waters for with
this got to get to that pump and destroy
it
Mike game might take too long to try and
do a no death run huh
well I guess I don't have to do
everything I skip out on action I guess
there's nothing saying I have to 100%
and I'm waiting for the storm to start
sending other than this level of things
a checkbox
I'm having a shitty fucking game
I'm blaming stream distraction that's my
official excuse
jack-jack will get here eventually
after I take care of the section of the
game I'm probably gonna go make sure
jadynn block up downstairs
you know it's entirely possible the jack
is outside right now unable to get in
that's a possibility
had a funny one nothing jack and again
what do you want time is built to this
wonderer your path however crooked has
led you straight to here our work yours
and mine
must soon commence come find me when
your spirit is ready
almost have a 15th history fuck you fuck
you
Daniel pump make it so that there's no
reason for them to come back
I am playing a shitty game right now
fuel storage one candle district
all right I'm gonna go make sure the
Jack can get in make sure we're not
locked up down our prayer
I'm back
one from the tunnels I need to find him
all right
how terrible am I do I don't love one up
yeah bad
we got five of those tokens I could have
as many as like eight if I weren't
second
now to begin my work
there's something that's doing before we
turn back funny but we've got all we
need
pies tall artwork for the magnum opus
it's not for you to understand I see you
have your secret reasons cuz I think
fate favors old chum
if you have to wonder solo please detect
this flare when you need old Tom Waits
Thai words
start with a car I do this alone
oh never mind all chumbucket never mind
never mind the old black finger his
sacred quest
I should try driving in first person
that sounds horrible I've always hated
driving in first person he games
maybe we would like an oculus if you
could look left or right I would be fine
with it ruin past you say you seek the
plains of silence but do you not wonder
them right now the remains of your life
a perpetual flight an escape from all
that is human
until one day because it's the other way
to drag in real life yeah I don't feel
that way you can drive in real life but
in real life it's really easy to turn
your head left and right to see what's
what's off to your side
what's so in a game well come much
before this purpose to you is made
manifest you know nothing of me
the bond you at June of the June of
drifting I'll fuckin Terrace you FLE
them Weiss these past phantoms and the
madness that crawls inside
you've come to Griffith for a reason
deep inside twisted around horrors from
which you run lies your strength Griffi
can help help your venture down to where
you dint go yourself and your true
promise uh chat cars are easier to turn
real life because you're usually not
driving at 200 miles an hour usually
usually slow down before you make that
turn
Oh Saul I got four tokens yeah I'm doing
like crap crap this fuck
Sporty's yes this is a new run I'm just
kind of testing the waters for a no
death run certainly not gonna do tonight
I don't even know if we're gonna keep
playing this ones Jax shows up under see
how easy it was the level up quick and
I'm not doing good so far but I think
I'm just having a bad run sided Oh
any trouble launching just steals her
away from us
no time to waste then we've gotta build
yes yes we do
we've done righteous work saved we have
what we need to install their nitrous
boost
leave
why doesn't max have a dog oh look at
that there's a dog max does have a dog
so suck it suck it what does it feel
like to be wrong horribly horribly wrong
much I've done yet sort of set of 900
people or 50 years however many people
we got this chat I don't know
Doug did die in the second movie however
this game doesn't give any shits about
any empty Mad Max continuities so there
you go
now he has a dog
fury road doesn't even give a shit about
the continuity I mean in fury road Mad
Max has a daughter who died though in
the earlier movies it was a son so not
know any be damned
know what I wish
that's the last back to my
yeah was the same director writer I mean
obviously he just doesn't give a shit
about continuity he cared about making a
fun movie today that's what he did
he succeeded
I don't know what his reason is for
changing it from a son to a daughter but
by god the car
all right came here from a scrap you
guys can suck it
some of those unfastens just feel so
brutal it's appropriate
OOP listen
how long have I been playing like an
hour
I started at seven seven ish
and I don't know it's because I'm
distracted because I'm streaming and
trying to talk I'm not having a great
run
nothing I'm terrible either
now do you not want to look at a
shirtless dude
Oh nobody here why didn't they spawn
it's so weird this means a whole lot the
song
no that was full that's nice
I do not know where Jack is right this
moment I'm sure he's around somewhere I
fully expect him to show up he didn't he
didn't cancel on me
at least I hope he didn't he's my ride
home
I got no updates from him one way or the
other
jack is playing rocket League according
to the chat I could see that Jack is
stuck at home until his wife gets there
so if he's playing rocket League it
might be because he's killing time
and that's understandable hey you push
the wrong guy max
yeah there has been scavenged
that's a bad story sure they have this
becomes more of a oh come and see come
and see you'll say yes with his hands
and the blessings of the sacred cylinder
she's come to life
my sweet combustor what I told you
VI don't be six yeah exactly
hate is the magic number you and me
we're gonna land a big chief a bonafide
bad boy ah 429 cubic inches 460 horses
holy rolling nobody could touch you on
the blacktop pay your knight right you'd
be evergreen eternal where is it
let's go there No
you got to love this hunchback is
basically building max a car for nothing
and Mad Max is yelling at him because he
didn't have a v8 and you can't put him
there that's great max isn't sure as he
should be
we have the car we need to go
you know a safe place somewhere we can
rebuild I
G of the great white we can make a deal
it doesn't sell site now the best we can
do I don't think we have a choice
what is this place this is part of a
great ride he's turning we're so fucking
like everywhere outs in this realm this
is white ass peoples turns Gaston is
going to be a location in this I haven't
gotten there yet
in my and my other save file but it's on
the map
I can only assume we go there
I will say this game feels too populated
for a Mad Max boy it's a little bit odd
why not here
I don't think we're going to see the
bullet farm nothing nothing in the game
is implied that bullet farm is a
location that will happen also the cars
in this game need fuel which is a nice
touch cans almost empty horseless
Oh what did you get here
oh my god they're swarming
the apocalypse has never been this
crowded before
that's my scrap
and you chew
Oh God
fuck the six months controller and your
white ass terms because I because I move
the analog stick a bit too far back when
I turn fucking off oh god damn it
you know it's gonna get punched in the
face ain't me how many people are going
to stop me on my way to the fortress in
this deserted apocalyptic wasteland how
many times is that going to happen
are you
so these are the the things you do that
level you up you don't there's not like
a general experience and you just keep
killing guys keep getting experience
it's you have to do these little
unlockable things kill X number of guys
this way and then you get a little token
and then every ten one of those you get
a full level
or minute charts the next one I got
Jesus Christ
I got a ways to go
his fury road was amazing
I so wish I had cheats quarters unlocked
so I even get your all your wonderful
riches but I can't because I haven't
seen gene yet I've been fuckin around
with cars show up now fuck off you're a
jerk
I'm gonna kill you just for showing up
too early damn I wish I wish I could
plunder you properly don't go over there
tires
so much crap fuck up
it's still a lot of screwing not as much
as I could have gotten though bring the
whole thing in intact
such a waste such a waste
oh god damn it
sniper
oh you're so dead you're so fucking dead
and I'm not gonna fucking shoot that
face which is
tires tires
really
whoa I keep hitting the wrong button
when I picked it up and fuck that fuck
that it really feels like fiction up
should be B but pick shit up bees is
shit your shotgun and I didn't have I
didn't have I didn't drink from my
canteen like few minutes ago that would
have killed me
all right let's get to the fucking me
before so if I see another one of those
fucking scrap cars I'd get a ton of
money and not just a pittance
that scratches off
take it back good German
adness
fast fire
ah fix the car
you know I'm getting at a higher than
normal number of car lights I pay I
think that's just one of those things
having an odd game cast out from the
bonfire their leader gee judge me and
found me wanting no fighting spirit left
broken a knowledge of their battles yes
town so what'll it be help me with this
loot and split it or Culp's me take it
all
sharpshooters and scavenger hordes to
come
J has not played this game
I don't so much help those guys out

more are you guys or did I not get full
credit for the last batch I don't know
weird set the nearest water yeah it's a
nurse water that's ways way now
well I do need wanna wrestle anyway
all right
yes we're back to quite right and if
anything but I have interesting things
to say all the time till then yeah what
you want out of me just to say random
shit spleen there I'm not quiet I said
spleen
pick up the weapon really she
for the record
whoa sneaking up on me huh
one one single bullet
I read the authority no I have not
you know I just talked about the heat
death of the universe I don't know you
really do I need people back there again
and when we won't we just be rehashing
the same ground I mean next time I have
something interesting and depressing to
talk about I'll probably just talk about
it there's plenty of depressing things
in this world I would worry something
will come up those guys one of the water
are still there
I have no interesting stories to tell
look this is what happens sometimes they
do a solo stream I'm I'm talked out
don't know don't know what to talk about
I'm sorry
bring them out
oh well it's fine I'm fine with that
Jack should be on his way
so there will be talking I need one more
before I him up great max a bit
you know what do you got on you tell me
you got some shotgun chills and use some
shotgun shells if Jack doesn't show up
what direction should you scream and one
my solo streams that I know they're not
great I'd ever never laid claim to
greatness but would you really say
they're that bad yeah or like that
forties I know I'm gonna have to scrap
things I'm not gonna be able to bring it
it's right unlock that for it first
this isn't far through this game at all
I kind of started a fresh one before we
Street I was curious undoable and no
deathrun would be in this
I kind of started out hoping the level
up quick leveling up quick has not
happened but dying hasn't happened
either
I'll keep an eye on her
one day they all came down all the
planes what do I think of the Fermi
paradox oh that's an interesting one the
Fermi paradox states that just just
doing the math the what's the other
what's the other doing when you figure
out how many aliens there should be like
even even without Lightspeed somebody
did like the math that the universe
should be pretty much fully colonized
with some kind of intelligent alien life
by now even even moving slower than the
speed of water I mean the universe
should be teeming with intelligent life
and so the Fermi paradox asked why why
haven't we met the madness if life
should be everywhere where the fuck is
it and I don't know what the answer is
nobody in since why is the fervor they
don't science doesn't know there's no
answer
a bunch of possible answers I mean we
could be the only intelligent life in
the galaxy one of the other answers is
that intelligent life has a tendency to
destroy itself with like nuclear war and
whatnot or intelligent life just doesn't
evolve all that often if at all we can
be first you could find videos online
that talk about the Fermi paradox better
than I could
