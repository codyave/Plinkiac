plan one two in store teleporter
teleporter and a crew member that's what
we need all right Rock pirates this is
gonna be tougher because now they have
two shields but I have two shields too
they have a rocket so it's really
important to get rid of their fucking
that's gonna hit me
dodge it dodge it thank you
all right let's do this
yes fuck that kind of shit really hurts
I crack in my home yes yes fuck fuck

fixing the fixing the oxygen is slightly
important there they're scrambling right
now yes we got this we got this maybe

yes okay great ah fucking hell hit me
with one last missile alright let's have
this Zoltan guy or pair our outside Jam

good heal up here and here up octave J
now get back to your motherfucking
stations we got some shit we got some
shit to take care of she had said what
yeah those missiles really fucked me up
but that's the other thing where it's
like if I can get if I can get a defense
drone that would really help that would
really help so what I'd like to do is
get one more this Jam here then go to
the store I think I can I can take one
more encounter definitely
you encounter a small craft with minimal
propulsion it's rock crew members
explained that the rock homeworld is run
on lies and propaganda that keep the
populace in check and that they want no
part of it tell them their God sent them
here to join your crew promised to share
with them the truths they've been denied
oh my god it's like I don't want to lie
to them because they're already running
out on lies I will tell them the truth
yes your promise has gained their
attention and they agree to serve with
you for a while yes thank you this is
super hype guys we have a rock crew
member that they don't have any fire
damage and they don't take as much
fighting damage and we have Amanda's so
who do we got here Rory Tate
Rory Tate you are the first person who I
saw cap locks
whoa I can type guys it's true
Rory Tate you are our newest crew member
you got it teleport I'm no Nico but if
someone asks if you are God tell them
the truth and you get a crew member
great
okay let's trim for the story if they
have a teleporter guys we are so in the
money teleport a teleporter teleporter
fuck no tell mind-control which could be
fun oh that does not have what we were
looking for okay what are these things
protect a ship from I am damaging 60%
louis's missile base weapons that 50%
chance of not using missile that's neat
Oh backup battery no we don't care about
that we don't care about we don't care
about any of this shit
Oh fix a couple of jams here
we're good on everything else well you
know maybe just get two fuels just to
have some fuel all right let let's bump
up some stuff here let's bump up some
stats let's pump up the jams all right
that'll help as we get some more jams
all right don't do that yeah I do I'm
gonna go here I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm
gonna throw caution to the wind
amantha ship here is adorned with rock
body parts it would be a gory or display
if they had internal organs but the
message is clear enough this is a hunter
of a very specialized kind put your a
crew member on the comm the two aliens
face one another over the vid screen
cave dwelling pebble van yells the
furious mantis captain see I paint my
ship with your companions I paint my
ship with you well fuck you dude I'm
gonna go ahead and say you ain't got
nothing all right flack the shields boom
and you officially got nothing literally
you got no weapons got no oxygen
you fucked son straight-up fight
dunh dunh excellent buy another one of
these jams put it on our engine get the
fuck out of here get a fuck out of Dodge
a motley collection of rock ships are
stationed around the beacon they look to
have restored resorted to a pirate's
life defensive maneuvers alright that's
fine they have two laser weapons which
could play havoc on my shields we will
see about that
black first alright so same as we ever
do if the shields get the weapons oh ok
that's nasty let's get our mantis to
repair those doors and we're gonna go
again shields
there we go now they don't have weapons
so they fucked I don't have the timing
just right as far as flak and their
weapons are concerned but we're getting
there there we go hey bucks
I thought you died no I'm not dead I'm
here oh my god there's Canada talk I'm
so sorry in our Canada talk why what are
you what are you dating here - oh are
you gonna you guys are a lot of
Canadians okay what's my stance on
Canadians I have I have family who are
Canadians love Canadians defence drone
mark one yes
I've been to Canada several times I
enjoyed their the first lady I ever
kissed was from Canada I fond memories
of Canada all over all over Canada's is
a wonderful all over that's the moral of
the story one more bar to up our ship if
you up the engine it means your FTL
charge is faster but it also in
increases your dodge chance so I would
like I have shields and I have a ton of
dodge which is really important to me so
now I'm just gonna collect money until I
can get a teleport I really could use a
teleport so I think I'm gonna hang out
and just try - here here here here here
here I think I can make it too
I'm erotic memories of Canada dick
actually did taste like maple syrup she
was wonderful
yes everything about Canada as someone
who does not live in Canada and only
visits every once in a while
everything about Canada is wonderful
the burnt-out hull of a rock mine layer
drifts by behind the wreck drifts a live
mine an automated drone that drills into
ships hulls ships hulls before exploding
it locks onto your ship signatures and
heads your wife attempt evasive
maneuvers the ships turning circle
proves too wide and the mine bites down
onto the hull you can hear it now
chewing through the armor sent someone
out to defuse it your crew member dons a
spacesuit and exits the airlock when
they open it up the mine housing though
they panic the red wire or the blue red
yes you open your eyes and everything is
still where it was a moment ago you did
it
22 scrapped 22 skidoo is more like it
red red I did it I did it we did it
can I do it can I tempt fate I'm gonna
we're gonna stick close to this line
alright you notice a rock ship
performing combat exercises however they
quickly change their course to engage
your ship they apparently treat
unregistered alien ships as handy target
practice oh my god
one two three four weapons but to beam
weapons
we're only kind of fucked back online
first laser go here we go Oh boom super
important take out their weapons the
rock ship hails enough we were told the
aliens were a threat to our ways and you
have proved as much take this and leave
us in peace well fuck you
Rock crew members you fired on me so
fuck you now you die
that's your lesson learned don't fire on
bitches unless you want stitches the
ship explodes leaving behind 24 scrap

she clue is now in charge of shields
creaming gets back on weapons dick the
birthday boy goes back on engines
everyone else is good we now have a
winning strategy so now we're gonna jump
here and nothing's here and that's fine
it's a waste of a fuel but I feel good
about these decision and we're going to
jump to the store and we're gonna heal
our shop and we're gonna stand up
goddamn fighting chance can't fix it all
that's fine we're just gonna fix the
most of it
oh I have an area anti-drone that we can
sell the way she'll charge booster
obviously I would love that but ain't
worth it if your ships broken put it all
under the ship that is a flag too right
gotta get a flag - now we're doing good
we're doing good weapons wise and now we
have our boarding party oh okay cracking
that oh we just all heard all of my
cracking knuckles
shields RH dances with Smurfs as rent
shields are the curse position so far
all of our shield operators have died
but you know best of luck to you
alright let's do this yeah that seems
like the smart way to do it let's go
here let's go down here we're gonna need
some feel soon Oh three shielded slugs
but that's okay they don't have a med
day so we can totally fuck them up and
slugs are really easy to to kill they
got some of their weapons our guys
fighting their guys totally gonna fuck
up the jams
excellent that's that's how you do it
that's exactly how you do it and they
come back and they're fully healed
because of our teleport booster oh
that's so great
and it's so effin great for some reason
our med bay I don't know how our my fake
I destroyed it I don't care
Black is great Jack don't you have work
tomorrow I work for myself so the answer
is yes but then I'm playing anyway I'm
playing FTL and we're having a really
good run and so this is what we're doing
now when you work for yourself you'll
work every day all right we need to up
our booster power here 15 seconds oh
great just kind of I've just kind of
like basically shirked all of our
engines I bought all these engine
upgrades it's like a I guess we don't
need him now
all right all right here we go here we
go jump let's go let's do
you arrived at a small slug repair
station greetings traveler care for a
fix-up we could easily patch up some of
that damage yeah sure
your dock with the stage and hoping for
a quick turnaround but the automatic
machines take their sweet time only one
damage we're glad you've enjoyed our
services now for payment to ensure your
cooperation we've taken the liberty of
installing a limiter on your weapons
system
oh great well by the way that's fine
because we have our boarding party
actually let's just take out their
weapon systems right away
absolutely fuck
just adding all of it to the dodge
hopefully you ain't got nothing you
ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing
the problem is they have a med bay so in
a perfect world I could take out their
med bay but they're not doing any damage
to me a while now they are all great
well great all right let's see what we
can do here let's try let's try a
different room let's try let's see what
happens if we take out their shields is
anyone in their shields weapons is
useless right now anyway
Jesus Christ there's a fire and weapons
what
shields back up who's what
damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it
get back here you fix our med bay
open the doors we got to put the fire
there's a fire and weapons you fix our
oxygen we're gonna need that oxidant if
it's one thing I know about people and
breathing as they generally need oxygen
yes
this I guess is just a losing battle I
can't win here
we just gotta jump
yeah I have nothing to sell I have
nothing good fix all weekend that's
disheartening close all the doors get
some oxygen back in oh just
disheartening but there was nowhere to
win that battle normally in a situation
like that I would use my weapons to take
out their med bay so that my guys could
could kill them without them
regenerating but uh they had taken my
weapons so there was nothing I could do
there there was nothing I could do uh
look okay run away yes
I probably should have bought some fuel
I wanted I wanted a hole I was greedy
I wanted that hole because you know
sometimes you get fueled on missions and
so I have four F for fuel that's that's
good goodish here and getting some nice
repair points here sometimes this game
is slow go back and fight no mochi I
will not go back and fight all right
Mario Mario get back to your pilot
position for some reason Rory Tatum is
Rory Tate is slightly damaged heal
yourself we need you at full out I'll
get back in there hmm we're still
streaming yes OS oh we are still
streaming I can't believe it either
what time is that it's twist a quarter
after 12:00 sweet jeebus
alright let's see how far we can make it
here we're doing this we're gonna take
the long way taking the long way open we
get fuel along the way nothing
man we're just gonna be drifting in the
nebula that's how we die oh my god
nothing we die drifting in the nebula
one more jump left Oh arrived to the
sight of two slugs ships and
communication range they don't see you
you overhear their conversation and
learn they're planning to raid an
infamous and likely wealthy pirate ship
in the area the pair jump off and you
note down their target coordinates one
jump left motherfucker well let's hope
there's fuel of this let's hope there's
fuel at this fight
I've decent doors so I'm gonna try to
suffocate them while my guys get in here
to help power charge up my weapons that
didn't do very much good charge up them
weapons get them weapons charge all
right oh they can't hurt me they can't
hurt me at all
priority number one destroying their
medbay
done priority number two killing them I
want to take away one there we go all
right and let the killing of the slug
people begin slug people are not very
good fighters and their weapons are
doing absolutely jack shit to my ship a
straight-up fucking them they're just
gonna keep coming in here it'll be a
nice easy fight oh my oh my guys need to
repair maybe he'll let him try to repair
their health bay that's fine they ain't
gonna do it I got all the time in the
world I'm even gonna take this perfect
take him right over there
not even a firearm he loved all it took
I'm a med bay just I'm a med bay like I
give a fuck
oh no they fixed their my bitch that I
really should have been paying attention
to all right but that's okay
reload my weapons I have a decent
cooldown time on my teleporters so I'll
be able to teleport them back wait for
the cooldown to run down on my
teleporters they can't hurt me anyway
there's their weapons are of no use
against me so then black and laser boom
and you know we do we tell for right
back in there now you're fucked 9 bucks
and I get your ship I'm gonna take your
ship and I'm gonna make it mine use your
bathrooms you can't do nothing about it
that's right
Shazaam come on back guys you did a
great job everybody
everybody you did a great job let's heal
up what do you say Kiran who are you
you're my weapons that's what you are
all right oh my god stop the jump
what can we hear tea towel McHale lady
you cannot Jack listen to the chat why
what whoa
what chat is delayed yeah yeah chance a
little or you know like I'm delayed how
about the machines no yeah like I was
they tell you if their ship is about to
jump so you do all like if your people
are on board and their ship jumps away
you lose your people big risk
Oh to fuel needed that one too I can
even do that I'm gonna do that that's
risky but I'm gonna do it attack be
automated yeah absolutely so now I don't
my teleporters are kind of useless now
so we're going to put all of our eggs
into
and and then I don't think they can hurt
me with the weapons they have we'll see
but we'll see
and you never know
well now they definitely can't hurt me
easy bees easy peasy boom boom boom boom
boom
yes gotta take away these piloting
stations normally I would be
concentrating on like their drone
control but their drones aren't doing
this shit to me so I say fuck it pump up
the jam no Tito oh yes some extra fuel
some extra jams oh this is great let's
get out of here let's get out of here
jump to the next sector
abso-fucking-lutely that's great and
that's uh
I even in light I did shit Beaumont
great for some reason I don't have my
save like I'm playing this on the
windows partition of my drive but for
some reason Steam did not hold on to my
save and I don't know why okay what's
going on here
what do I need
should probably spend some money on some
extra powered bars just to get all the
jams up and running
all right let's jump let's do this stick
in the nebula
jump into the middle of a plasma storm
multiple recently incapacitated ships
loom in the shadows briefly eliminated
bed lighting anytime you have a blue
option that's the option you choose
because my pilot because Mario Mario a
has such skill I think we can get out of
here within the ships graveyard you find
one ship that seems relatively untouched
on board you find an unconscious
passenger and take him back to ship once
awake they offer to join your crew in
thanks and our new crew member has super
shield ability yes excellent
tres Jen Trez gin you are the first subscriber I
saw so you get to be our new shields

crew members and the rest of you can go

crew to slavers absolutely okay get
shields back up and running
yeah weapons online
and get teleporters online alright so
what are we gonna do they don't know

have a cloning bay which means once we
kill them a clone comes back so that's
the thing we want to take care of first
