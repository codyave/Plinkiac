refilled my snacks we are tonight we are
drinking lakefront breweries
Wisconsinite everything from this beer
is made in Wisconsin that's nice it's a
nice light beer
what are we talking about you're a
Michigan ER
I'm Michigan air I don't know what that
means
someone wants to know if there's been
any development on the best of the worst
episode no one even dared to touch the
development is no one has attempted yet
we shot a best of the worst episode and
after filming you know watching the
movies and filming the discussion all of
us agreed that it was terrible and so we
just we threw it under the table no one
is ever going to see this episode it was
terrible and we moved on with our lives
Mike has since said that he would like
to take a stab at editing it as a
challenge as an editing challenge but
you know we get busy with other projects
so so far no one has touched it I do
think that they are going to try to
cobble something together from it but
man man it was bad
and yes buy snacks I do mean booze let
me oh there was a pic of naked Lea
Thompson that's alright I'm sure I can
find it I have the Internet April I love
you asks jack did you ever play Pokemon
tried to slash blue of course I did well
I've played all the Pokemon games
I would love Michigan beers microbrews I
think I'm actually gonna be in Michigan
in a month or so for a super-secret
thing so when I am there I will look
into Michigan to microbrews
come I get it and I know it's you know
it just might be bad it might be a
really bad episode it might be a bad
idea to make that an episode okay so I
remember that I'm supposed to lock down
the castle now I got a bunch of money so
I can upgrade some stuff let's see that
we want it who do we want to fight the
enemy here they've stayed in critical
strikes our Burien like barbarians yeah
we have our Burien to fight the monster
we can probably up our attack let's see
um
see if we can get a better weapon dude
way in Locka oh yeah and like some armor
here get some good armor a nice chest
there we go
take a look at these ruins runes see if
we have any better ones no okay so then
let's go back here and upgrade just kind
of our general attack power here tack up
absolutely we want that and our magic up
and is this so we can do one more I mean
just attack up of course all right so
now we are going to lock down a castle
unlike some more classes yeah Alan like
more classes but I'm going to fight the
boss so I wanna
the dances were Smurf says he still
wants the worst best of the worst but I
don't have to edit it so I guess that's
easy for me to say well it's like you
know it's not even it's not even about
the editing it's about the content like
if it's just a bad episode if we are
boring then it's not worth it it's not
worth putting in time because editing
these episodes takes you know a million
gazillion years not really knowing it
does it takes a couple days it takes a
couple days a couple very long days and
so you know does does might want to put
in those hours I'm not going I have a
map oh I can go right to the boss that's
right oh why am I even messing around
with these jams
and go right to the boss go to the
teleporter go right to the end boss
that's why you lock down the castle boss
location here we go
okay
Oh got a chicken I'm at full health
we're gonna fight the boss which is a
giant eyeball
Kadir what what
okay okay okay Oh spice there spice oh
my god oh my god he can hit me with his
pupil
Oh terrible terrible
terrible what just happened
I think I'm bad at this game we're gonna
try I love an axe well if scythe would
be nice a walking tank walk home on also
week I think I want this person you
can't be this guy can't well like I said
I'm no I don't believe I'm very good at
this game I have not and we want to lock
down the castle again absolutely I have
not yet figured out the flow of this
game teleport to the I monster I know
that now teleport to the I monster don't
mess around with anything else
all right I'm gonna try this I monster
one more Kadir the gatekeeper spice
I've been kidding me with the spikes
don't touch these people oh how do you
do this
how do you do this only farts can slay
an eyeball is that true
oh you just got the notification now to
it and John kilo that's really funny
Bob devil is mark go oh dude Oh an axe
that'll help critical strikes could be
good Oh upside down
look at this vertigo the entire world is
upside down I hate that so I'm not going
to do that absolutely
let's try next if I can throw an axe I
might be able to do something - tell me
I don't think I have an axe an axle
Holly I forgot to lock down the castle
you guys you guys are gonna be so mad at
me you guys are gonna be so mad at me in
like two seconds when you see this I'm
about to watch this happened on the
stream right now where I forget to lock
down the castle ready
he comes here comes all of your comments
forgot to lock it forgot the like oh my
god I'm so sorry I'm so sorry everybody
I am new to this game keep that in mind
I've been playing
I've been playing on my Vita for a
little bit now and I also have it here
on Steam and I was hoping to play
tonight actually just to kind of help me
a little bit because like I mentioned
earlier I feel like I don't have feel
like I don't get this game yet you know
I don't get that how the combat is
supposed to work none of it feels love
it feels great to me it feels great it's
critical like that you know like
especially with action games it's just
supposed to be very natural and I know
like like 'hey i'm gonna keep comparing
this to spelunky because I think it's an
apps comparison it also took me a while
it took me a while to internalize all of
the controls and get that muscle memory
down and just figure out what the game's
rhythm
figure out what the game's rhythm is all
about the rhythm is gonna get you guys I
don't know any of this I'm here to give
you a chance a lifetime 25% of your
curves or colds will give you a chance
to open one three desks one chest will
triple what you paid but the other two
are empty and I show us give a try okay
first one in the box nothing oh oh oh
nice UHF reference that's fun man right
there that right there is kind of fun
use your brain muscles I can't I can't
use my brain vessels big thing is
learning enemy patterns yes I creamed I
agree I agree
learning enemy patterns just learning
what to do in all of these different
situations and that's just gonna take
time and I I'm ready to put in some
hours
we have the rogue legacy
but right now I definitely don't have it
is a black chicken as you can tell as
you can tell I just don't quite have it
yet
yep yep muscle memory
all about
favorite material for pants you know
cotton anything cotton I watch speedruns
on YouTube speed runs of this game I'm
sure and quite sure
ADHD means you move really fast you
conduct electricity really well I can do
I'm sure that will come in handy later
anything far away is blurry and you have
trouble remembering where you are well
we don't want that let's be really fast
73 40 don't have enough for that for 73
88 to 60 map name she's fast - is really
fun I saw someone to come and say that
Zelda choose underrated
you know perhaps I
I would definitely be interested in
playing Zelda too as an adult and as a
as now you know I played it as a kid of
course not it sucked because it wasn't
Zelda but I wasn't very interested in
playing it now that I understand how
games work in general
nice nice gold
place main each a stage this Valentine
suits over here
goals is always good seem to be killing
people better like a chicken leg I can
request a chicken leg I think I would be
happy
No
shewag
got a chicken leg yo thank you okay
found the boss again that's good you
like don't want to fight the boss head
you know it's crap first that's
important that's important
Starbound I don't know if I played
starbomb I guess I can't be I don't
believe you that zelda 2 was designed by
Albert Einstein I'm just gonna go out
and say that
I'd love to Castlevania too as well
sequel itis question mark I don't know
what that question is I like the sequel
itis series I don't know if you guys
have seen it but you guys should
definitely watch the sequel itis series
really fun bit of
the Zelda 2 is designed by the USSR to
undermine the morale of children that's
hilarious
I will not forget to like the castle I
swear all states are great someone asked
me jack what movies are must-see in your
opinion there are so many there are so
many must-see movies oh there's my sword
- who do I hit people with my sword
my god
getting out of here I'm gonna try to
kill them from afar get out of here get
out of here
no okay
like Planck papers please oh my god that
would be that would be amazing mic
playing papers please for the first time
we're gonna say movies that you need to
see so many Rocky I saw someone
mentioned rocky for earlier everyone
should see Rocky
everyone should see predator if you have
not seen predator see predator to create
movie I will remember to lock the castle
this time what do I want here knives
disc likes ladies there was no pain sure
knows no pain means that I can't see oh
here I can upgrade some stuff here get
some new glasses and I have a mage
transform your measly mages into
Archmage's master of all the arcane arts
change whatever spells you have on the
fly that's really nice
and convert your barbarians into
barbarian Kings learn the secret shouts
of the Bears and shouted at things until
they explode that's great great so
remember my barbarian can now power us
do but if you notice in the top left
corner
art lock the castle well hog the castle
confirm it block it we're gonna try to
beat this big boss do we know where it
is
you know like I don't know a pathetic
one says that he thinks that the Karate
Kid is a must-see I you know I like The
Karate Kid but I don't know if it's a
must-see like I don't know if it's up
there as far as classics are concerned
and it's like it all depends néstor
can't be fuck you Mac and me Howard the
Duck tremors two ghosts come on come on
like it all depends on what you're
looking for if you're just looking to
have a good time there are movies to see
but if you're looking to study film
there are other movies to see who also
Kieran mentions two best friends play
someone just pointed me to their stuff
recently and that seems like something
that rich and I have been talking about
a lot about Let's Plays and I am in
general I think I've talked about this a
million times I'm in general against
Let's Plays because I'm an editor and I
don't think that they involve much
editing and so I mean I'm Jane in
general against them but someone just
today pointed me to two best friends
play which is just let's play material
but with just two the edited funny bits
to it and and that seems like something
that I would really enjoy doing and so
rich and I have been talking about
adding that to the
prereq YouTube channel is some sort of
edited let's play like two best friends
play because that seemed that seemed
like a nice balance where edited
material but also easy to produce
Thanks
I have no idea how you're supposed to
defeat this guy I'm supposed to dodge
all everything
yep okay
oh here and you were the said guy on
Twitter great thank you thank you for
telling me about that I really enjoyed
it I watch a couple of their videos and
that seemed like like the way to go
let's see here
what so you're ripping them off well I
mean I I will be taking their style
elements of an edited let's play and
using it towards prereq where it's rich
and I someone says jack opinion on Mel
Brooks he's very funny
Mel Burke's is very funny but don't ever
listen to any of his commentary tracks
I made the mistake once of listening to
the Mel Brooks commentary track on
Spaceballs and it was the most tedious
thing I've ever listened to all he did
was he he told you that joke I was about
to happen after the joke happened he
said that was a funny joke
that was his entire commentary for the
Spaceballs DVD
I'm very clean I can do foods around
dude I don't care about that spell cycle
yes you want to do that walking tank you
want to do it we'll try the Archmage
against the big boss I will remember to
lock down the castle we're gonna try to
take on this big boss
what is your favorite Mel Brooks movie I
mean
Spaceballs is great Blazing Saddles is
beyond brilliant
I don't think Young Frankenstein gets as
much love as it deserves look because it
serves a lot of love I mean yeah
Dracula did loving it of course is you
know the best Mel Brooks movie because
it's a meta commentary on that box
perfect it's a complete joke please
don't watch jocular didn't loving it you
will not have a good time at all
a Bock right away a pathetic one says
monster squad or Goonies Goonies of
course monster squad is bad monster
squad is I mean Monster Squad is is a
funny is is the best premise of any
movie ever and it's completely wasted
it's a disobeyed bad movie
Young Frankenstein is great Robin Hood
men in tights you know like that's fine
that's fine late Mel Brooks Dracula then
loving this really is really bad it has
bad jokes
what monster squad rules no no I thought
it was really bad I thought I thought it
was almost the best of the worst
material monster squad it was it was so
terrible dad
like that alright let's try this lady
and we can't knock me back and I'm
talented but have a few issues let's try
this remember to lock down the castle
blank remember in Monster Squad like so
month if anyone heard those who don't
know is what I guess I was a monster
squad is about a all of the old
Universal Monsters Dracula
Frankenstein's monster The Mummy attack
a small town and a group of kids tries
to fight them which sounds like a great
oh the werewolf is there too and so that
sounds like a really great premise but
the movie is really terrible terrible
and hackneyed and half of the movie all
of a sudden turns into a buddy cop movie
about one of the kids dad as a cop and
like he has all these like buddy cop
moments it's really really strange but a
really great premise so what just one of
those things with just one of those
things stop making sense
EKOS best concert movie ever made might
might be Wolfman it's Tim plays wolf
man's got nerds that's a line that's a
line in the movie also in Monster Squad
Dracula picks up a little girl by the
neck and calls her a bitch so you know
it's got that going for it
it's not very good it's it's cute before
being like a goon for being an attempted
Goonies clone with a really great
premise it's cute but it's not good
epithet iguanas absolutely correct when
you're nine monster squad is great
oh my god going the other way now
get out of here with your jams
and losing
there we go here we go
oh my god okay I can do this I can do
this I can do this oh so close that time
so Evan close uh darn darn darn darn
like that axe I want that axe so we're
gonna try a lady Antoinette to the
second remember to lock down the castle
I will we're gonna do this guy's we
aren't going to do this why don't you
Kate could I will work on getting good
I'm gonna be this boss this is what is
going to happen I have the ax I have 120
alpha I'm going to beat this boss I'm
getting it I don't know like I have it
we're gonna be designed almost there
full body third says bah XCOM because of
the stream that game is the shit so much
fun rich Evans is a genius that is true
that is all true I did really enjoy
ex-cop my you know rich got a little
backseat gave me with me but I did I
still enjoy it all and we will be doing
more XCOM a Streamy stuff
now if I can if I could avoid like one
fucking thing here there we go I know
I'd be a bad attack
now being good
we can do this guy's what oh let's see
here
guardian shield oh here we go axe fell
cycle fuck home was dark house breaks
that's right okay yeah
we can do this we can do this we can do
this should have played that cougar you
know I don't necessarily get this game
locked the castle will go to the boss we
are gonna defeat this boss within the
hour
that's what I was saying that's what I'm
going to say I'm gonna defeat this boss
I'm learning I'm learning as we go I got
my axe
here we go really it was another try
I know mages have Shay to be fun
I want the axe and really I should be
avoiding these things anyway so it's
gonna teach me how to better avoid hope
it's going the other way this thing go
away this time
oops down go down go down
that okay well that's you know what
that's them then that's fine
bye sir JP thank you for coming up sir

a little warm in here that's my problem
solver
good ear micro silence a second super
concentrate
I've actually never had this class
before that takes knock-back damage from
these things and that really sucks
and spikes types types
Oh down down down

the game oh yeah yeah we're gonna get
there Jack put your glasses on the eye
oh my god I haven't been wearing my
glasses this whole time

Smurfs there's a marvel what if Jack was

the eye lock down again or beaten that
motherfucking eye we're doing it beating
that I until I give up
that's great whole thing I crazy fat
Athlon is Jack who owns the rlm firearms
I guess that would be me when you hear
him ready to attack you need to drop to
the floor says mokey b85 does he have
audio cues maybe I haven't been
listening to the audio cues
all right I'm going silent
fucking did it oh that feels good that
feels very nice
Poole yes that is very nice
also the eyeball does have audio cues
and didn't have my headphones fully on
oh that's that is a load up I was really
worried that I was going to fail for the
entire stream and you know hang my head
in shame forever and ever but we did it
everything's gonna be fine everything's
fine here how are you
of course gonna die from a fucking
painting now get out here oh yeah next
you want to go right to the forest
Kieran says
forest is the next level I think I'm
just gonna concentrate on getting some
jams for the moment not dying
yeah I find it'll help there we go nice
go old heat some gold just like gold
doesn't really matter because jammer
Mick jammer making the guy is going to
be taking most of that
nope - trite into them yes thank you
mochi for telling me that there were
audio cues
the force is the next easiest air but
I should probably should probably grind
a little bit dwarfism paladin gigantism
knave a spell caster muscle wheat we
don't want that
let's take it to war everybody likes
dwarf alright upgrade some some Shania's
here let's see what we got in our armory
Department not my terrible amount are
these guys this is my magic sure
something let's see if we have any more
ruins or ins I just have another -
nothing good nothing good alright so
what do we have here unlock shinobi the
fleetest of Fighters that seems pretty
awesome a mock miner raise your family
fortune let's go is shinobi I mean cuz
it's a ninja super fast super deadly
warrior we're just super head head if
they can't take a lot of hits but they
can dish out the paint believe it well
then I'm just super fucked crit chance
up oh that's really nice
all right how to barter let's see here I
have three twenty what can i buy can i
buy anything can i buy anything for
three twenty no no you don't have any
jams neither do you know what was your
thing what was your other - thing - no
all right so I guess I'm just losing
that 320 that's fine John Franklin
alright let's go
I have the upgraded chest plates but
agenda check what is their preferred
hair color on women my whiteness
whatever my wife's hair color is that is
my preferred hair color in women which
I'm sure is a very bad answer but not
for me Oh
you know hair color actually I don't
think matters that much as far as women
are concerned
their color is something that can be
changed so why bother yourself with that
superficial these superficial parts of a
lady just that find a lady she likes
find it ladies get spend some time with
it
who's in the other room playing Mario
Kart I'm the lady who do you have some
interest in and has some interest in you
do I kick ass at Ft hours it's just rich
rich or really kicks ass at FTL and I'm
hoping to play it tonight I also um oh
yeah we want to do this in the box
nothing oh so stupid rich really kicks
ass at if you and I'm actually thinking
about not playing FTL and playing
gunpoint instead Oh
nope alright for better but way we'll
see oh my god
terrible dying all the time and then all
right
kirtan says I like non natural hair
colors for late hair but I'm a hipster
d-bag you know and Mario Mario says that
currently there is no girl in his living
room playing Mario card you got to find
that girl gotta find that girl to be in
your living room and buy bar cart
oh okay o our first shinobi class well
we got to try out a shinobi got to try
out a shinobi class ooh all right let's
go
yeah well I mean I can give them FT I'll
try I will
I like FTL and I'm not too bad I might
plant easy just just because I'm not I'm
not as good as rich rich these are
really good at FTL
okay so not to agree with this you know
we
that was very nice to have all those
dealings open
oh my god this shinobi character is so
oh my god it's so fast footed blue blood
cape I have that unlost in my other game
and what Kate has vampirism which means
I get a little bit of help for every
kill oh my god spikes oh gee jeepers
creepers guys okay yes I will okay it
seems like people want to want me to
play up to you and I will be doing that
I'm gonna give this one more life and
then then we're gonna take a little
break and then I'll come back and play
some FTL okay let's see what we have
here sir Wallace gigantism that's always
nice let's have a giant let's have a
giant lady here but I get it I didn't
get anything
and 300 goals will not buy me anything
yeah I have the good chest plate all
right oh yeah I have a good chest plate
already
oh oh is our blood cake what cake what
cake lucky how much for the blood cake
500 for the blood game
okay we need at least $500 that's our
goal
all right let's go
I love it when it dies
get out of here with that that she's
this is like I can just hacking it up
probably can't do that yet backing it up
no not quite all those guys
okay
graceful if there's one word that I
would say describe to me very well
oh okay we're gonna figure that we're
gonna figure that teabag out of your
eyeball - I've got two out left how long
we're gonna separate bets how am I gonna
last
my guess is not very long if there we go
don't think getting friends to watch my
career reviews is hard and it's hard to
sell other our stuff yeah that's that's
probably true you know it's for most of
what we do you have to be a movie person
you know you have to you have to be a
movie person to really especially like
stuff like best of the worst one only
movie people are into bad movies you
know blink it is one of those things
that's kind of more a little more
Universal infotainment if you will one
dollar
okay guys Jack interested in playing
more binding of issac all the fucking
time I just don't want you guys to get
sick of binding of issac so I'm not
gonna play it tonight I'm gonna take a
little break I'm gonna run a commercial
and then we'll come back and we will try
to two-way net sum FTL so be Rebecca
