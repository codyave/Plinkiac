all right I have better slappy strengths
and I've got a better slappy plan
where is it specifically I think it's
over here Oh No fuck's sake
magazine drinking which importantly
means I will no longer throw up when
drinking too much turned around I mean
it'd be good all right all right I don't
rich why don't you drink in real life
I'm I'm uncomfortable with with a
chemical altering my brain I'm very
uncomfortable with this
did I ever drink in the past no I never
felt the urge I don't really need the
leadership book
not really I'm gonna need the extra
firepower yeah we're DS bad to the
breaks
wait actually do kind of want the
leadership er
changing my mind why are people obsessed
with my not drinking to be fair it is
kind of weird in the grand scheme of
things
want this leadership book but there's
nothing I want to put down to get it
rather have the bat for this fight but
the bat was about to break near by the
punching the flaming the boxing gloves
the the best weapon I could think of to
grab than I I knew where the do the the
right ingredients were to make it
nope that's what I want
I know I'm trying to I know the boxing
glove and bowie knife is fairly good
pretty good for bosses it's so good for
bosses I'm trying to avoid using them
feel sorry for sloppy yeah kind of
he thinks he's killing the guy who
started the outbreak take a break my run
continues well I'm gonna yeah I took a
bathroom break at the very least
here we go here we go
nope
I missed
how'd that kill him last time how did he
kill me last time I i completely forgot
that you could stun lock him with the
jump kick strats I I clean forgot I went
and played around with the the game when
I went home after I failed I I reloaded
the same with slappy and I jumped kicked
him and he knocked and he fell down and
it just it just all fucking came back to
me alright you can jump kick slappy and
just keep him down I felt so stupid
after I remembered that
yeah we've already saved Jack in this
game
it's done
yes it's a dildo
whereas my foot so nervous because I
fiddle constantly and you know this
about me everyone knows this about me
and there
all right doing pretty good
I check time one more time oh I get it I
get it you pervs
side-missions available here alright
we're on top of everything
feels like I'm missing a Zombrex feels
like I grab the three in the casino sure
you could ask this lap but would you
ever consider playing Knights of the Old
Republic one or two I am just completely
not interested
burned out man not so much burned out
it's just I haven't I haven't liked all
Star Wars all that much since the late
90s what I ever consider playing
injustice to yes but I'd probably want
to play injustice one first
all right what are we what are we doing
what are we working on as well I may as
well do the little casino I mean a
little pawn shop quest thing
they get the combo card for money
sledgehammer ax I'd like to not build a
combo weapon unless I got the card for
it but if I don't get that ax thing soon
fuckin
I'm gonna need that later
yes the Defiler is the proper name of
the weapon I'm calling it the
sledgehammer axe I'm sorry I'm so
fucking sorry for your loss your
personal individual loss
I have no what I were to double check
maybe just went by it
Defiler pepper Hecker
hell-blade oh no why this is the driller
oh I do
oh okay sweet
pawnshop ever worth it I mean I'm here I
may as well unlock it yeah why not
plus I'm gonna read
and it shows up as a quest on there it
feels like something I should do and so
I did it
make it look easy make it look easy
alright I'm gonna take a potty break
I'll be back I will be back
so I grabbed some Chewbacca cheez-its
because I needed something to snack on
they they have little pictures of Star
Wars shits on the cheez-its
look at this
I have no idea if that showed up on
camera probably didn't but I had a
little picture of r2d2 on it it's
getting chroma keyed weird just wired a
few I thought you'd be interested in the
absurdity of Star Wars characters on a
chizel
well I tried all right I know didn't
show up I'm sorry I tried
okay they're stars there all right I'm
gonna killed I'm gonna kill time I'll
make it to file her and they'll grab
some more Zombrex for Katie and I got to
drop some of these books
what don't I need leadership
I don't need leadership I just don't
need it and that's the book that is
right yeah all right I can grab another
one if I need it okay good good good
there's no time to kill maybe a little
killer
Farah wounded Dead Rising 2 now I'd say
over half but not far over half we're
close to half
like anything coming up that I'm
dreading the poker match less so that
something could go wrong and more so
just I you could just run it a bad luck
I have little control whether or not I
run into some really bad luck
and then I can't save those three take
the pledge
all right yes did rising forests
absolute garbage
oh wait that's not what I need that's
what I did
whoops whoops
maps are good maps are good useful
things
sounds like the dudes who made Dead
Rising 4 or getting laid off maybe it
means good things for the French I mean
they're gonna stop making games in the
franchise is what it means franchise
dead
so no way to get downstairs into the
tunnels a wall I guess there isn't
oh that's behind there all right all
right
why are these women still working
yeah I leveled up that's what matters
man man we're the stairs back that way
directed to do do do do do do do this is
what I'm trying to find reason I came
down here so I could grab this am I
gonna watch the Olympics well if this
raid probably not tonight
what do we drop I guess the answer has
to be there
right on all right
and we're off
I really need one of these one of these
level ups to expand my pockets I need
bigger pockets recall saying this boss
being fought on stream probably you
probably haven't seen this boss fought
on stream
I'm farther than I've ever been on
stream
his weak spot is shooting him in the
crotch when he's taunting you
you may now kiss the bride
Oh shucks you and your one-liners when
something terrible happens to people
you're such a sociopath but you've got a
daughter
Chuck's fine Chuck rains fine you can by
the way after you beat him you can use
this chainsaw
unfortunately it sucks oh I feel dirty
I got nothing I got nothing else armored
with them so it's too early for the one
guy
I'm too early like Randy would have been
ah yeah wait four minutes for this guy
to show up cause the time of the casino
stick to me wait there
what did mean hit you
you go there
all right that's enough litter um I have
some uh shot all right all right
fuck you gotta be careful really close
to leveling up
wait there
no nobody has yet died on an escort
mission
whoo
it's impossible to be doing too good
who are you my name is rich Evans what
welcome
Oh Jackson the chat you're asking
previously recorded live who they were
yes jack is in the chat now apparently
hi jack what's up what's up man I'm
doing great
wicked
I know you guys are gonna hate this but
I'm gonna check my cheat sheet and make
sure I'm not missing anybody
I'm gonna use my cheat sheet
she's not there yet
all right
where are we at I just have a list here
of when survivors spawn and when they
asked for requests just cuz I really
don't want to fucking miss anything now
never got that call about Lynette why
why are not Lynette what's her name
though the one with the golf club you
don't know you've never seen it before I
know who it is though okay okay so
talking about thinking to myself why
don't you dress up the character cuz I
like looking silly Hey looking sillies
for nerds
your weapons break in this game yes
keep moving
all right the Flint around
I know looter zombies ever that's a good
question
you think you think a few of them would
have gotten taken down by the zombies
I'm going to talk to you I already
talked to you I know what you saying
goddamn toys no she's got her models
nope no Lenny isn't here yet
I found all the possible toys I'm only
missing one thing I can't get it to
later
we may as well do Stuart's scheme now
before you forget is that would be bad
those are mute this is our mutiny event
here
Stuart threatens to leave we just talked
him down it's no problem unless you
forget about it then it's a problem
excuse me
yes Stewart is always trying to ruin
things
there's something wrong with Stuart yeah
he he wants to he doesn't like you and
he's gonna leave with some other people
I haven't been reading I forgot why so I
got to convince him not to leave with
other people and get all those other
people killed because Stuart's and
dipshit
look up yes to is a greedy half cycle
that is that's pretty accurate yeah
can I just kill him I can't use weapons
in the safehouse
I wouldn't do it anyway come on
what happens if you don't talk to him he
leaves and he brings other survivors
with them and they count as being dead
and I will have failed in my attempt to
save everybody that's what I think
happens
I don't think Stewart's ever had
successfully had a mutiny I'm eight so
I'm assuming it's like the mutinies in
Dead Rising 1 which may be a mistake
did I get to slap yet oh I fucking tore
slappy apart I made slap you look like a
fucking joke
yeah
uh what do I need I need to go this way
yike yike
but you're you a full-time streamer I
wouldn't say full-time streamer mostly
I'm doing red letter media related stuff
I'm gonna like an hour to kill in this
game I'm gonna double-check make sure
I'm not missing something I understand
I've got too much time to kill man and
it feels weird no I'm I'm good I'm good
and half an hour ass not that much time
welljust will just get in the vicinity
of where we need to be how about that
psycho prep I think I'm good I think I'm
good
well I got four combo cards I don't I
don't have a great strategy for this
next two upcoming fight I think I tried
flamethrowers once I was underwhelmed
I'm gonna say we're good with what I got
what's the next fight you'll see you'll
see
about a half an hour in game time away
from it so I went from thinking I was
behind to killing time
hmm
hmm
probably
do I ever use the bees I may once or
twice they're not that useful in this
particular game
told you they weren't nice ladies
part is great for freedom bear hmm-hmm
never thought to try that particular
Strad I should be alright
this outbreak is killing thousands
people are dying
Oh
all right
no I don't want thank you no stop stop I
don't want to god damn it that was an
accident
so not a bad strap
quick-step
and painkiller nice combo for this fight
feels like I'm wasting health but I'm a
quick tank
quick-step is worn off
fuck
magic work
OOP well you only have to kill one of
them
you will never get out of here alive
Chuck we promise you that
picking up the drinking magazine was a
godsend said this battle is specifically
why I picked that up Chuck was actually
caring about someone dying and no one
lighter I know this game has gone off
the rails
Oh
what
got that drop that I want the fire
extinction
not anything you think we got everything
we need
I really should make some more help now
that's the quickest route probably left
what
how am i how am i I'm fine absolutely
fine
ah it's maddening
nope don't mean to do that
actually I already gave her one of these
bearers I'm doing something different
with this
we're not quite ready for this yet
yes
I'm gonna come back for I need to get
some health ready
Oh
okay okay
now we're off to our next boss fight
what difficulty is this as far as I know
this game doesn't have difficulty
settings I'm gonna try this freedom bear
here we'll see how this works probably
poorly
hey buddy I don't think there's anyone
there what's cheese castle the cheese
castle is a tourist trap right over the
Wisconsin border because Wisconsin
Wisconsin cheese place called the cheese
castle they go there they sell a bunch
cheese did you come over the border to
Wisconsin you think I want some of that
famous Wisconsin cheese look this place
called the cheese castle finds like the
same voice sound to a slappy probably is
it's a nice place the cheese castle I've
been in there Karen loves it every time
we go by Karen insist on stopping at the
cheese castle
oh it doesn't work
like you follow me I guess it makes
sense
and I made it look easy Chuck I'm trying
not to make the Wolverine gloves because
they're overpowered that's some
challenging myself my daughter
this one's special
all right
he's quickly run over here that's kind
of
did you get destroyed No
a spider-man spider-man's forever
arch-nemesis though truly is just Peter
Parker's social life yeah that is the
true villain martian manhunter can see
what that's all about how about a new
game well I want to see everybody's
super I want to see everybody's stupid
to do doesn't take a lot to impress me
yes but the big hand is funny
Oh oh he's like superpower is like stop
it
Deathstroke looks awful he looks better
in Arkham origins
look how does that work
bro - he can shape-shift his
shape-shifting is different from
expanding your mass to become a giant ah
you know it's just shape-shifting it's
all just different shapes get your ass
to Mars well I get your mass to Mars I'm
gonna go help Martian Manhunter gross I
think though I didn't know a superpower
was to become a giant and he's also got
brain powers at his shape-shifts he's a
weird one you know he is a weird
a lot of your powers there we go
rich can you ask Jack to stop getting
shot in the face by just oh thanks I won
I won that one I will try to stop
getting shot in the face by Deathstroke
but it's hard because he keeps shooting
me in the face you got a player badge
icon I wanna walk on all this great shit
for you which is this lets true form the
spiky head thing yeah okay alright who
else we got here who else do I need to
see the super-dee-duper of Oh bane cuz
you know what I'll be honest I just
don't care about killer frost but I do
want to see Bane super to do and Oh
would that we should be scorpion oh we
know you know what his soup D do do it
what is it this is classic one from the
game is that the good over here I think
this is a regular just his normal grab
yeah that was back back B I think does
he do another one where he rips his face
off and spits fire mmm you like a skull
it spits fire at your face we're gonna
be scorpion so we're gonna find out what
is fatality yes fatality was this goal
with the fire I think
you've ever be able to handle well sure
I know Harley Quinn's got fan armor just
wait until our fan armor that's a great
way of putting it
yes people love her so much that she has
to do well right yep that's cute
askew
Oh week gets too pretty deep back
how one could win a fight with vain it's
just not likely can you imagine the
Harlequin from Batman the Animated
Series winning the fight against babe by
accident maybe as part of a joke like I
didn't get to see you right like didn't
Batman just figure out how to beat Bane
in the animated series by like cutting
his tubes well yeah we're gonna retry
cuz we didn't get to see Bane super to
do
Harley block animated Bane was kind of
like yeah but really animated Harley was
just Joker's sidekick right so
animated vein was okay but not the huge
threat we should have only because it
came up at around the same time
nightfall was going on I'm kind of glad
that man the animated series didn't go
there Bain wasn't really an established
character when that show was going on he
was just the gimmick to break Batman's
back as part of a publicity stunt yeah
and I don't think Paul Dini or the rest
of the writing staff respected bang
that's her
but he was popular enough so there's a
dildo episode is the paint episode is
gone
there's your fanservice we're gonna go
back to characters we like yep some on
the chat trying to bait me blatantly and
sang the weakness of animated Batman was
his voice we needed to sound like the
Nolan Batman
obviously that's obviously that's a joke
so hit me some more hit me hit me
super goof oh shit shit oh no oh she
blocked my super dupe again man I just
want to see the super dude oh you know
we didn't check Harley's other costumes
to see if she gets Harley Quinn harlech
Harlequin Harley hold on let's look that
up you're such good things about Batman
animated and want to watch it but does
it take a while we're good or is it
great from the start it's arguably
better early on what for Batman the
Animated Series oh sure like like the
second season due to network pressure
that works more like super villainy kind
of stuff but first season of Batman it
wasn't always villain of the week
not always there's enough of that
so I'd say yeah I'd say actually better
early on different outfits cannot see
the different outfits look with the mr.
freeze episode is that a good starting
point for Batman the Animated Series I
mean that's a great episode that's a
great up go to the mr. freeze episode
the money first shows up there saying
you're in the wrong View mode aren't you
I don't know what that means
so like if I choose Harley alright so
you can choose different outfits and
then you press the a button for classic
skin okay but it doesn't change what she
looks like
right there maybe they consider that her
classic skin but it doesn't change wound
no matter what you choose
so we'll see we'll see okay you'll see
the costume in-game yeah but I want to
see it before so I know which one I'm
choosing dig oh yeah there it is classic
Harlequin Harley
help-help pick part of ice is the
episode while I wasn't sure a part of
ice was the first or second mr. freeze
episodes I don't mind I don't want to
just blurt it out great episode
Peter there we go Oh in the back fence
and says did it injustice is a bit like
Star Wars master of Terror
sign where Darth Vader could get beaten
up by a Tuscan Raider fun but
conceptually wrong for the source
material
I'm making a fighting game you need
balance it's fine
it's all fine it's fun it's you know
most of this is just about fanservice
it's just about like he want to play as
the character you like you want to fight
the character you like why does Bane
look like he's getting set to join me
he's Cirque de France right
he's a Luke this is his luchador a
outfit looks like he's about to go be a
bike messenger ha ha yeah yeah it looks
like he's about to do some power walking
can you do my bait I can do my baby boys
yeah wait does her outfit take damage or
does it just start that way for some
reason I don't think it started that way
I think it takes damage interesting very
I like it all right let's see is that
all of our characters that we care about
seeing the super to do forward we know a
Catwoman super dupe is I don't know
Lister cattleman
oh wait and we want to do scorpions -
that's right Catwoman's gonna beat up
Nightwing you keep saying scorpion and
there's comic books comic books I'm
thinking Marvel's spider-man villain the
scorpion oh yeah
how much money would they make without
Marvel vs. DC fighting game a million
billion dollars Marvel vs. Capcom is a
fun fighting game already sure mother
fucker
oh oh she it's like a dime are we ending
the stream when Jack is bored of this
game well probably you guys don't know
but we've been doing shit today there
ever a good GI Joe game I would be
shocked they didn't make a shitty Ness
game of that whole team there's a half
decent NES game oh really
but only half decent there are there
haven't been many good GI Joe games
oh no my laptop is we're starting on its
own time windows Thank You windows I
think I am done with tips for the night
owl we'll see how long this wants to
take doing restarting updating of the
update for your update configuring
configuring thank you for asking me
windows
oh come on
Nightwing Oh someone I Twitter's Batman
oh yes say I'm better than Batman see it
Sam better than ever had Dick Grayson
doesn't have that kind of a song Oh
Dick Grayson doesn't give a shit no no
that's more of a decorations to
laid-back that's more of it Timmy what
fucking planet Adam just gonna keep
moving along as a better that's a fair
question what did that change happen I'm
gonna say nineties no no second Robin
died mid-80s really yeah
but when did he come out is Nightwing is
that any work not even necessarily when
he came out his night but just one thing
he stopped being Robin mmm
we're saying mid-eighties but wasn't
wasn't Jason Todd already a thing by the
mid 80s mid 70s that sounds like it
should be more write to me you think
because yeah well you ever seen my twins
original costume oh yeah yeah everything
comically 70s oh I always pictured that
as a tease because didn't have the
mullet - I can't believe that costume
wasn't invented during disco habit the
mullet
I guess the mullet was around in the
eighties I just think of it as in the
seventies I just think of it as an
eighties thing Jason Todd died something
like 87 so he probably had to have been
around at least two years just to be
established before they go before
killing them off with feeling a big deal
I'm sure that's okay scorpion he's Robin
in the Teen Titans until the 80s until
84 when he shed the Robin name I can't
believe that original Nightwing costume
was a prior to the 1984 the collar alone
screams at least 77 no no no later than
77 just for the collar
also no one remembers there was a female
robber she was robbing for like a month
she was uh she was robbing in in dark
night right I wish it was that an
Huntress was robbing for a while there
enough spoiler spoiler he's robbing for
a while and then DC fridge her and then
they undid that because it just made
everyone feel ugly and then I don't know
what happened
but Dad I'm not gonna feel guilty for
spoiling a 15 year old comic book
oh the joy cook joke is her name is
spoiler are gonna spoil I had to fly
over my head
Green Lanterns super in this game needs
to be throwing fridges as enemies yeah
but it's only a one hit kill affair
female no you heard women in
refrigerators women in refrigerators
look it up it's a whole thing
it's a whole it's a whole thing I mean I
don't have time or really the desire to
get into it now that that's a great
ending shot right there it is it's a
great ending shot scorpion hovering over
the dead corpse of Superman it's I'm
gonna look it up I'm gonna look it up
