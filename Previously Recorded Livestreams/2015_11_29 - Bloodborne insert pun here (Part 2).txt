oh you know what that's great
okay MC Lucas home let me defeat this
guy over here real quick so we don't
have to worry about him Oh already
wasting a blood vial can you imagine the
robot voice lol back mark my cock my
cock seems like photo lol fuck my cock
so what we would do is we would set up a
tier to be like if you know if you want
like if you want us to say it to dollars
or more oh you know the robot voice to
say it like five or ten dollars or some
like five or ten at a robot yeah I get
it
again the joke was you refers to the
bait and switch I mean he's gonna be one
under two dollars then the robot boy I
thought that's what you're going for
Oh we'll see because even even with our
two dollars we it like if there's
something so heinous you know we
probably won't say it well that's that's
when you get the robot voice reading off
join the not-see party
no you know exactly that's that's why
there needs to be a like a higher
monetary limit to the robot voice where
there's no filter why the robot voice
saying you know rich sucks Hitler cock
exactly whereas we could filter that out
is this UMC Lucas do you use the hammer
I really want to learn to use the hammer
but I'm afraid because it's a slow
weapon I love the hammer you know the
hammer that's also a sword oh I love the
look of it but it's not it's just not
it's not very as effective as anything
no I'm waiting

yeah I can't guarantee that this is my
own original thought okay I'm the Big
Bang Theory yeah but it's like blackface
there's the nerd version of blackface
it's nerd sploit ation that you know why
you've heard this from me I mean it's
from you this looks for me cuz I've seen
a couple episodes I'd see maybe maybe
half a dozen episodes of The Big Bang
Theory because every you know because
I'm a nerd everyone's oh you must love
the Big Bang Theory and it's horrible
every single joke is at the expense of
the Nerds yes it is nerds ploy tation
it's terrible not only no I mean it's
it's it's the it's the just the worst
stock nerd character ever yep nothing
it's not a unique creation just what so

stereotypical nerd this dork right
threaten young yep little Star Trek he's
completely socially awkward ever even
the the stock stereotypical nerd yeah oh

right there can you believe that the
nerd got the hot I mean come on what

the giant invisible monster on the
outside of the chapel it said I needed

remember hearing something about that i
frightened you know the order in which
you have to do things to get to the DLC

made it to the DLC yeah it took us four
hours now we're gonna walk around for
five minutes you're gonna keep getting

all I need to do looking there's the
lamp this is all I need
well rich Evan this is a perfect rich
evidence impression wait this is the
someone else's saying oh my name is Matt
I'm stealing that yeah
such consistency with the Oh My gods I'm
a parole
everything is new rich
No Oh oh that's right I'm an online mode
again fucking you might need it
huh you may need it I know but all it
does is ruin things for me rich are you
dying what would make you think I'm
dying I've been screaming for an hour
that doesn't help
if it's because my voice sounds off I
got the points for that guy killing
those things yes that's interesting I'm
sure he's going to be perfectly friendly
nope nope who could have imagined that I
should probably look you should probably
look where you're going come down here
and fight me down here I don't want to
fight you up there man
where'd he go I see him
I'm gonna hide behind this rock
now you're gonna hide behind that rock
well I throw a Molotov cocktails at you
is this being incredibly cheap yes is it
gonna work maybe I don't know QbD theory
thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it it's true it's another
nice message oh I beg you
thank you I can't read it but thank you
he's legitimately stuck
I am totally teasing him rich with these
windfalls if you considered buying our
lemon firing Mike and Jay and then re
hiring them at a greatly reduced wages
yes two dollars at a time another buck
fifty and I own our own literally that's
how much it's worth
here's the thing though if I bought our
LM I wouldn't be able to get Mike and
greatly reduced wages they would
probably charge an arm and a leg for the
services right and then without them our
ulema then worthless it would be the
worst business decision of all time I
guess I got to fight him now I've been
choosing him for so long
hey you don't have good job cheese bring
down there and hope yes I want to see if
I can quickly fruit pie magician says at
your level I would say parrying them is
your best option
I did say parrying and not parodying
because my brain for after I said that
thought I said parody wrong right but
I'm not sure that's what I did oh my god
right this is what happens when I try to
fight him it just doesn't work
I don't want to fight you I just want to
win Jack the stripper double-oh-seven
says cheesing is the only way to play
this game great this is not necessarily
true but is certainly certainly very
effective I feel terrible about this
there's another one coming oh shit
oh my god
maybe you just want to get the fuck out
of there not some cheesing yet I don't
think you have any choice I know lucky
bastard fuck yeah
run oh I got him a little bit oh I
thought this was a I thought this was
like a boss this is just a normal guy
this is just a normal doing across
hunters hopefully is a random hunter no
it was not like this they respond did
they respond that's I think they do
because there is two ideas then you're
fucked that way there were two
identicals of him then I just used all
my malls for nothing Jim by Jim says
with your best Spanish accent mm-hmm it
says he told sulla hey ma ma che ha I'm
sorry I'm a Sita okay
nasi necesito su leche mamacita I think
that's about right that doesn't sound
right at all
what doesn't sound right about that I
don't know whatever he said do you know
Spanish none then what are you bitching
about what was wrong what was what is
your critique Jack what's wrong with
that the accent was on the wrong I don't
know
they respawn and there's also a boom
hammer man great I feel great about this
melt and mail that says Mexican here
that was alright okay no there you go
rich isn't a literate Hispanic expensive
just says you just endorsed the Spanish
Nazi Party which is quite possible we'd
have no idea we'd have no idea what you
did Public Enemy 11 says the player was
in kin you can also get a beast
transformation mode in the DLC for
blood-borne what I don't know what any
of that is oh oh that's why the play
that's why the other guy looked so funny
Oh transformation transformation mode
well but you know what it doesn't matter
I'm so boned I can't even beat these
guys these are just normal enemies and I
can't beat them so I'm just gonna
concentrate on like picking up shit like
here's a there was a shit here I'm gonna
pick that up I don't know that is old
hunters clubs great and then we're gonna
concentrate on running past this guy
nope
what what oh he came from oh ma fleshy
patch says yeah okay here's the
situation okay my parents went away in a
week's vacation and they left the keys
to the brand new Porsche Willie mind hmm
well of course not Mario Mario 42 here's
the situation a mystic parents one who
sends padding yeah yeah nice so just in
case it's going a little bumpy on use
the situation has anyone really been far
as decided T wait what has anyone really
been far as decided to use even go want
to look more like I think that's
delivery ages too keen on sencence sure
let me know you do it better
has anyone really been far as decided to
use even go to want to look more like I
think I left out a do in their bed it's
fine I'm gonna go okay I got a cap and I
got a gloves that's what I've
accomplished
means old memes is that a thing was a
sentence a thing maybe could be I have
no idea all I know is I can't beat these
two guys more dyslexic than Jack
question more that's what that's what it
sounded like yeah that's how I live
everyday life what has never been far
even as decided to go want to look more
like yep has anyone ever been far even
as decided to go want to do look more
like great rich Evans is not dyslexic
and there's anything wrong with being
dyslexic I'm just there up because
people are saying things then give me
all over me did you know that I just
know I like to be not like anything
wrong with that there's many things
wrong with that
remember woman I do how was that note
helpful I'm not sure this is sarcastic
odd last Fox says by the way now is
versus the Evil Dead worth checking out
get out of here with those jokes with
these shenanigans oaks I think we should
just start our own stream that's that's
after Evil Dead the name of the stream
yeah after dead
getting out of here Walking Dead does
their it's not a stream it's an actual
TV program that's the talking talk show
about the walking dead yep oh my god
that is a lot of enemies on the screen
yep one time I'm just running I'm just
seeing where I can go
I guess there's another one this is all
oh my god oh yay demon Dobermans oh my
god it looks very difficult and I got to
say I don't like a look of it it's you
know what I think it's like a daytime
thing is that why I like I sure man just
it's it's kind of bland looking it's
gray yeah it's brown it's Britta it's
all brown and gray which is not usual
blood-borne which is all you know dark
and black and slimy this is not a slime
use the rest of the bug blood-borne Jack
is to hug me it's Jackie's dogmeat
that's all I'm doing right now is just
seeing how far away can run danger
peanut thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it it's true we really
do 14 months Wow they keep subscribing I
don't know they don't understand that
we're bad they just don't get it oh wait
maybe I do want to go yeah you're you're
totally you totally don't belong in this
area nope oh listen I get Creed the game
is saying fuck you get out of my house
this is the same thing what's going on
huh yeah I agree the DLC is this large
area this is there you go you can't have
any of this please go away no it's worse
than that you can hit you can have all
of this is there an unwelcome mat in
front of the entrance to this area you
can have all of this you just don't
deserve it that's what the game is and
yes you take it like the good boy you
are of course I don't deserve it I don't
deserve it but I'll work I'll work hard
for it I'm gonna get it I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it this is terrifying
brown and gray oh it's not a shooter so
it's okay I I'm against it I'm saying
this is the blandest area I've seen a
blood-borne what do you want yeah okay
they said there's more stuff if I can if
I can get to the top of those stairs I
was running to there's some more stuff
you know what I hate check what people
yeah yeah hmm I guess I could see that
especially people that put words in your
fucking mouth that weren't there yeah
yeah peace yeah this this this the
strategy of yours is working so well
it's a great plan rich I got a great
plan here I'm gonna run to the top of
these stairs and go to the right go pass
the mob ones go past that guy he's no
he's no good to anyone
roll past the dog roll past the other
dog roll past that guy go to the right
go to not nope shit not up there which
there was an area that looks exactly
like this in blood-borne already what
the Blandin blind wise and what what
sense
shit can't get up there
hey I opened it you know what I did I
progressed I just opened an area well a
friction Jack didn't hate Metal Gear v
so much I get it I get it I'm assuming
that's joke because I did detect I did
like Metal Gear 5 I just hate the story
so I'm assuming that's a joke I have to
or my sanity will just be gone no rich
people think we legitimately hate all
what a fuckin the TV yep I'm not dead
I'm not dead people assume B I do I dare
the nightmare frontier saying look like
this
the nightmare frontier made of weird
like Lakes
yeah the nightmare front and you know
what the nightmare front team was that
have rockin legs didn't it yeah it was
rocks yeah so there was a reason for it
to be brown do rich and Jack like Metal
Gear Solid one two and three not at all
in my case I haven't played I haven't
played anything of 3-1 I thought was I
kind of got it despite hating every
moment of the story and then too I
stopped shortly after starting never
touched three
charging up again oh why did you back
off Oh your health your stamina stamina
stamina Stan
Stanley no stamina stamina why do you
why do you unlock why did you unlock
well that's okay I opened that gate
this will help me maybe I don't know you
have seen less than 5% of the DLC lol
right oh no I'm here way way too early
here's here's my real hope 1 I got it
you know like I unlocked it so now I can
come back any time right so what I'm
hoping I can do is run around like a mad
person and collect just like one cool
thing right one cool thing right now I
got a hat my gloves let's see if I let's
see what the old hunters hat looks like
what are Jack's odds of finding one cool
thing gloves oh yeah see look that's
pretty cool it's pretty cool hat so I
want to run around to find like one cool
thing and then and then you know we'll

was at the streaming and I kind of I
kind of wish the teleporter once so
weren't so overpowered on the boss
because the only sane strategy for the
mothership is teleporter kill off all
the crew except for one in the first
phase and disable the missile washer
always disable the missile launch that's
the first thing you have to do nope nope
nope
see I I'm not healing because I know
Jack was having health file problems
earlier and I don't want to use all this
hope vials not getting any further in
this game basically I'm just killing
time till he gets back cuz I don't want
to ruin his run his game I don't you
know whatever whatever there I will not
be playing FTL tonight actually I guess
there's no point to beat around the bush
but the plan was to play more
battlefront I'll fly some space ships
like the bishops
oh I wasn't targeting him that was that
was a mistake
that's right in battlefront I am a great
layup do I have an opinion on the super
Star Wars series first nests no not
really
it's fine action platformer with Star
Wars characters that's pretty fun
but even at the time it was never one of
my favorite games oh shit fuck this oh I
got
this is just this is just brutal
plus my camera is inverted Oh God
Oh didn't mean to do that
does it mean to do that didn't mean to
do that
Oh God Oh God it's unforgiving jack
unforgiving okay yep all right
everything's fine this should be cleared
up hopefully soon it was just one of
those things where is like the the
amount of small transactions was just
enough to be like you need to double
verify that you're an actual business
come on make sure give me the info
because PayPal they don't give a fuck if
you're a prostitute or there we go great
as long as you pay your taxes as long as
you're off of PayPal's back they don't
give a fuck fleshy pad says derp PayPal
my donations have resulted in zero blow
jobs thanks for your concern well there
you go it's true it's true zero blow
jobs I was open an account of donations
by way I would really hope so unless we
should pool the money afterwards gonna
go to a prostitute then it will have
just not yours
that's what is your plan run
my plan is to run and what is your
somewhat longer term as planned yeah we
can stop playing there's anything you
want what l Metron 106 --is what's this
talk about under level what's this talk
a lot under level you know you don't
have to level up and from soft games
just get good that's true

hey where's the surgery altar I found
the headstone CBDs theory says that was
like an entire fan script yeah that's
great so over here this headstone that
uh that the doll sometimes comes that's
how you get to the the nightmare okay
which is neat but I got a pen dude
I gotta pendants where's the new altar
that sounds fantastic that where's the
new altar there's the new altar someone
in the chat where's the new altar I want
to fuck with my body Anonymous is Jack
this is important I'm gonna need to know
okay it's life or death
okay do you still remember the
differences between rows and columns
like the columns in the Coliseum rows
columns he did it folks were whoever in
the chat said that I've never thought
about columns like columns that hold up
a building before and that did it that
just did it that air it's gonna stay
there whoever in chat said that first
thank you cuz now I will all forever
remember that columns are up-and-down
rows or side to side so yes by the way
that's a good question
you're getting lots of congratulations
and well done jack has learned yay you
know learning is not easy
can't find worse that where's the body
altar
does anyone know where the bad altar is
MC Lucas said that the surgery altar has
passed the first DLC boss oh so
basically you're never gonna see it I'm
never never that's that guy so I'm gonna
read it first
oh wait no different guy different guy
but it's the one with the missing $0.50
all right DJ 1996's apologies for the
missing 50 cents I'm from Canada and the
currency was all messed up oh yeah this
should be enough so sorry for the
mistake guys you can buy at least five
Greek prostitutes with this new tip you
guys and your Greek prostitutes alright
DJ is original comment yeah uh yeah I
want to order one gram of coke maybe
some meth and adderall
should be enough for all that you were
50 actually it wasn't enough it was 50
cents 50 cents short but thank you thank
you we appreciate it I think it's great
I think it's great that you guys are
just pushing this boundary with PayPal
that's fine when when I get when I get
audited next year this is all on record
this is all saves on record and I'll
have to improve receipts for all this
and and my accountant is gonna look at
all this and go what the fuck were you
thinking
I wanted to be funny I mean it and he'll
go
okay obviously I'm not going anywhere
soon all right this is important this is
important Jack when you put the Brussels
sprouts and bacon is the bacon raw or
cooked okay
so here's here's the important part with
the Brussels sprouts and bacon one you
got to cut off the stems of the Brussels
sprouts it has like a little stub of a
stem to cut the Brussels sprouts in half
or if they're very large in quarters
that'll make them cook a little faster
now put it in a bowl with some olive oil
salt and pepper mix it all up so the
olive oil kind of coats everything then
you put in the bacon raw raw you put in
the bacon raw 375 about 4550 minutes
okay and you want to wait until you want
to wait until the Brussels sprouts look
almost overdone you want those the outer
layer of the Brussels sprouts to be like
dark and crunchy you're even the ones we
gave you weren't quite done enough yeah
they're good yeah yeah but like Jack
given confront confirmation jack gave me
the shitty Brussels well you know no
everyone got the shitty Brussels sprouts
because the turkey had to go in the oven
and not the deep fryer
so everything so everything was messed
up but bacon goes in raw once the bacon
gets crispy and the outer layer of the
Brussels sprouts gets crispy it's like
nothing you'll ever write it's great
effort the oven is the best way to cook
bacon because it cooks evenly it is only
got literally I don't know next up on
Brussels sprout chat Dylan lip says
Kickstarter wrap up review episode when
also spoilers Vader is Luke's father
you know these spoilers are all fun and
games and city guys mentioned something
recent not sure he means by the
Kickstarter wrap-up slash review episode
I think we talked about this once we
rich and I have a lost episode of prereq
where we reviewed early access games oh
yeah yeah we did we did a necrodancer
visible link it was we did a full we did
a full necrodancer
Oh what it was finished when it was
finished yeah still like it
yeah and we did recap on stream and the
recap is I didn't much invisible ink for
me lost a lot of its polish lots of lost
a lot of its newness so I didn't I
didn't much care for it now that the
full release is here crypt of the
necrodancer still amazing in grade and I
still want it on my Vita which may or
may not happen but I haven't I'll admit
I haven't replayed it much but I still
do like invisible ink yeah and it was
very satisfying beating it on normal
mode with an actual last map and whatnot
and you know I thought the last map was
like no spoilers I thought it was a real
letdown after beating it where it's just
like oh it's one of those things I don't
know like I said it just it became more
boring for me and it lost all that
newness that would have carried me over
the normal boringness because I played
it in early access the campaign could
have been a bit longer
I think but I've heard I haven't really
played the DLC yet I've heard that's
what the deal see actually does they I
don't know there's some other story
twists in there okay so yeah and and
creepers the necrodancer really loved it
crypt of the necrodancer the greatest is
even better done yeah it's the great
anonymous says movie spoiler in Star
Wars Episode one The Phantom Menace near
