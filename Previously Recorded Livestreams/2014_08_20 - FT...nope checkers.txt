Jay: We don't know what happened to Rich Evans.
Jack: We don't...I'm reading, John Kilo, I'm reading your resume right now, and so far enjoying it. Hold on.
Jay: I don't, I don't refuse to look at Deadly Premonition. We just haven't. But people keep saying if I like Twin Peaks, I should play Deadly Premonition, so...Oh, favorite Kubrick movie. Oh...that's a tough one. You know, I'm probably gonna have to say The Shining, just cuz I'm a horror guy, and I love The Shining. 
Jack: I think it's good.
Jay: He's made some good movies, though, that Stanley Kubrick.
Jack: The Shining...
Jay: You know what I love, that a lot of people think is, like, one of his least movies, is the Eyes Wide Shut.
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: I love that movie, yeah.
Jack: I think maybe I saw that too late.
Jay: I saw it, I saw it opening weekend. I'm so glad I got to see a Kubrick movie in the theater, cuz that when I was old enough to where I could.
Jack: Oh, no. I meant too late in my life, like, before that, I just, like, watched all of the classics. 
Jay: Oh, sure.
Jack: All the Kubrick classics. And then, like, it is a bit of a, a jump from the classics to...
Jay: Well, it's a different type of movie. I'm a big fan of, uh, uh, like, Dark Night of the Soul-type movies. Like, a lot of that, most of that movie takes place over the course of one night.
Jack: Yeah, yeah.
Jay: It's, uh, Tom Cruise just, you know, walking the streets at night, and, yeah, it's really, like, seedy, and I like that kind of stuff, so...
Jack: All right.
Jay: I like that movie a lot. 
Jack: I like...
Jack: And, of course, the, the costume party orgy is just one of the best scenes he's ever filmed.
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: You like what?
Jack: Oh, oh, I was just, I was, I didn't know you were done with that yet. You know, I, I also like what, when he went into the costume shop, right, and then that actress is there.
Jay: Oh, Leelee Sobieski.
Jack: She offers herself to him, and then he comes back later, and her father's in on it. Yeah, yeah, it looked neat.
Jay: She's, she's hiding in the closet with two half-naked Asian men.
Jack: Neat.
Jay: It's a good movie.
Jack: It is. I was gonna say, from a technical standpoint, Barry Lyndon...
Jay: I've never seen Barry London, actually.
Jack: It's very boring.
Jay: That's fine.
Jack: Much like most Kubrick.
Jay: I was gonna say, it's Kubrick. I'm sure it's slow.
Jack: The, but the story behind Barry Lyndon is, uh, Kubrick wanted to shoot it, shoot it with all-natural lighting.
Jay: Hm.
Jack: Top piece lighting, which is all candlelit.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: And so he needed a lens with a low enough f-, f-stop, to only light his scenes with candles.
Jay: Hm.
Jack: And so he actually got a replica of the lens they used on the moon.
Jay: Oh, my god.
Jack: Because that, they needed it, incredibly...
Jay: Is that partially where the, the myth that Stanley Kubrick filmed the fake moon landing...
Jack: Yes.
Jay: ...is that where that comes from?
Jack: Yes. that is where that comes from.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: And so, you know, watching Barry Lyndon, just from, like, a camera operator's standpoint is beautiful.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: It's, it's just a beautifully-shot movie, all with natural light.
so yeah I've got a
couvert box I like it's in there I just
haven't watched it take a day yeah
that's great you could have dinner with
any of his movies like you have to set
the day aside to what watching and
watching Magnolia or something like this
is what I'm doing today yes this is a
green will make a nice lunch and then
the rest of my day will be filled with
watching this movie Oh Green Green you
know the shining you know you just
hearing you call that a horror movie
it's so not it's so great that's it's I
mean it's not what psychological it's
it's essentially a horror it's a
thriller
yeah I don't like those labels when they
call it like Silence of the Lambs as a
psychological thriller that's a four
movie shining is great shine is great
yeah I just you know I don't know I'm
sure people are already typing yeah I
add a thing the other night where I
don't know what started it but I was
thinking about Shelley Duvall because
she's great in that movie yeah really
good actress she's also kind of
funny-looking
I was like what the hell ever happened
to Shelley Duvall that's a good question
so I looked her up on IMDB she hasn't
been in a movie in over a decade and
before that her roles were kind of
sparse where's she
she was olive oil she was olive oil in
the Popeye movie yeah but where's
Shelley Duvall was she doing these days
what happened to her did she retire
okay do you know where Shelley Duvall is
was the shining her last big thing no no
she did stuff all throughout the 80s um
actually her last maybe not her last but
one of the last bigger things she did
was a movie called home fries do you
remember this movie with Drew Barrymore
and Luke Wilson came out when I was in
high school oh she placed your
Barrymore's mom in it is that the one
where Drew Barrymore has to go back to
high school no that is not a quarter uh
what's the name of that movie never been
kissed bitch if rich are in the room
right now we can tell you Mike and him
or extras in that movie oh we're never
been kissed Kylie film in Chicago ah
there in the background at a carnival or
something I don't think I've even seen
the movie there oh that's good that's
good information
okay so home fries I don't know anything
about the movie she works in like a fast
food place but as Shelley Duvall's in it
I discovered that when I was trying to
figure out what the hell ever happened
to Shelley Duvall well now we know that
maybe it's just because she is Emma she
is she's interesting looking yeah and
she's worth to I mean she worked for
Kubrick she worked with Robert Altman
like she worked with all these huge
directors I'm just trying to think you
know obviously for Popeye she just looks
like Island shit yeah you could not cast
anyone better as all of them and in the
shining having her be so strange-looking
adds a little bit to the strangeness of
the movie oh yeah and so I just wonder
if that was it like those are the roles
she was getting and she decided not to
take them who's like a good nun how
would she work through the Elm to Woody
Allen Robert Altman Stanley Kubrick I
guess I'm retired to like plug it's all
downhill from here could you imagine
like could you imagine doing a home
fries doing that might have been what
killed it what the fuck are you due Luke
Wilson I'm out of here just like talking
to whatever the hack director hey man oh
actually the guy I don't know who
directed it but I know the guy that
wrote it uh was the creator of Breaking
Bad he went on to be the creator Mickey
bad oh yeah there was some prize about
drew I don't know oh that's right you
don't know I know you're very much I
remember coming out when I was in high
school sure bear whores pregnant in it
and she works at a fast food place
that's all I know
okay we might not be streaming anymore
no we're still free right any huh yeah
someone just said Annie Hall that's
correct
hmm you guys still getting this is
happening where is he
we might have also lost Richards
alright alright
we are still streaming right we are t
will is miss our incredible home fries
discussion
oh god no but for some reason it's not
showing me correct thing oh there it is
Jack when's the next Plinkett review you
guys I hate to spoil it and Jay I hope
you're okay with me and giving out this
information oh it's fine it's it's
actually coming out tomorrow you guys
it's coming out tomorrow
probably around 1:00 eleven twelve
o'clock kind of midday Central Time
yeah Central Time midday um and it is
going to be on home fries really so
weird that is such a weird coincidence
we've been biting our tongue this entire
time I didn't even know um oh my god I'm
totally fucking you guys are gonna see
some weird shit it's really like like
weird home fries it's like weird well
listen I don't want to spoil any of
Plinkett's insightful insightful tidbits
about Home Fries so I'm not gonna sit oh
my god we also we just might have to
call it because we're having pretty big
technical issues oh really
we're having more that screen funny oh
alright I am back rich can you tell any
stories about being an extra uh never
been kissed
no being an extra is the dullest fucking
thing it is we we sat in a room me and
Mike I think it was literally ten hours
and then we were out for like an hour
worth of actual filming it mmm like a
merry-go-round or something um no what
I'm rubber big on me yeah
Ferris wheel a ferris wheel okay hate to
be the jackass I'm like the roller
coaster oh god wait done yeah they told
us to come back the next day we did not
alright I think I fixed our fluttering
problem I no longer see flutterings how
much did they pay you do you even
remember and you get paid very very
little to be an extra I don't recall it
wasn't that much never was for works I
worked
technically as an extra on the nightmare
and almost remake for one day oh no it
was an extra you are like going to be
the stand-in er so you do write I
originally contacted them this is when
we were just shooting weddings at a lot
of free time and I grew up a huge fan of
Friday it was like holy fuck they're
filming the remake in Chicago maybe I'll
try and get be an extra on that so I
contacted the extras person and then
they said they said hey you're your
height and weight you're perfect to be
the stand-in for one of our lead actors
also Kyle Gallner was his name I think
he was in Haunting in Connecticut or
something like that but they want me to
be his standin so I went down there for
one day and they took a bunch of
reference photos of me standing next to
him I got to meet Jackie Earle Haley I
got to see him try Alma's Freddie
sweater for the first time which was
cool and I got paid for that one day of
just hanging out on the set before they
even started shooting and then I
realized oh fuck I would have to do this
for two months and just stand around
while they liked the scene yep I was
like that's not worth it so then I just
I just quit like I was there for one day
I got to talk to Jackie Earle Haley I
got to see you know the sets and the
costumes um that's all I need I'm not
gonna stand around for two months you
could have made so many contacts you'd
be making you be directing big Hollywood
for Jesus yeah I don't think that's true
I don't think that's how it's where I
that's how it works you could have
directed 2012 what the movie looked like
a clusterfuck and I guess that turned
out to be the case - but like they one
of the lead actresses who was playing
the not Nancy but the the the other girl
the equivalent of the Amanda Weiss
character from the original the one who
gets flipped around the room you know
upside down and stuff yeah they were
like a week away from shooting and they
hadn't even cast her yet it's just a
mess the summer though it could have
been into the storm directed haha by
j-bone this is the thing though it was
like I wanted to do this not because I
wanted any sort of in on a Hollywood
movie because I could not care less but
just because I was excited to be on the
set of a Freddy movie it's all I cared
about and then I realized while being
there and listening that the people
talked that nobody involved could have
cared less about being working on a
Freddy movie the Jackie Earle Haley this
was clearly just a job for him all these
people they were it was just a job it
wasn't anyone but like Freddy especially
or in any connection to the series it
was just a cash-in remake Oh Jack if you
considered rebooting everything um that
well that's a question for all of us how
much longer do we feel like going
because yeah everything by the way on
our end is absolutely failing I am kind
of shocked my back has lasted this long
okay I just had a minor episode I
actually want to do some stretches okay
because so that what that means is we
are gonna call it because literally the
game is not working my little just wait
yell video is not working oh wow and so
happening I have just so much no idea we
got some gun point then we got a lot of
good but we got some papers please
that's a favor split some glitchy yeah
so so we're gonna go ahead and call that

get some sort of video going I can't

you
you
I'm chroma blind it's true
it's true so not many resumes Tareen
so I'm look I'm a little disappointed
but I enjoyed a lot of them specifically
John Kela ah so the winner of resumes
round 1 is John Kela with a runner-up
for dick button runner-up for Arthur II
is that just because of the dick but yes
okay I really like the dick but it's
then every time I see a dick but on the
internet it feels enjoy is that a thing
on the internet the dick but apparently
I've never heard of this door of I know
what is it it might one of the origins
of the dick but I don't know it might be
a reddit thing okay I because that's
where I usually see it mmm it's it's
just something where like I'll see a
video and like the videos I always see
it is is like you know in movies where
they show someone they're looking down
at a piece of paper and they go ah and
then they show the piece of paper and
that someone like digitally inserts the

okay thank you for the source of dick
but
favorite movie soundtracks oh that's a
good that's a good question
score or just song that collection of
song you know it's a really amazing
soundtrack with both score and
collection of songs what is that Royal
Tenenbaums oh yes I would agree with
that mark mothersbaugh does all the
original score hmm and it's beautiful
like orchestral stuff oh yeah a bunch of
bunch of classic kind of funky rock
stuff yeah
well ten above some crackers and the use
of the songs in the movie are perfect so
that's a good marriage of song in the
movie yeah I love the score too
punch-drunk love John Bryan why are you
laughing at that just cuz I know you do
it it is the best score I think that
score is so amazing it's and it's so
perfect for that movie yes that is very
true I've got this kind of the balls
okay that rich is playing checkers by
the way for a moment there I do forget
I'm glad that you're happy it makes me
happy that you're happy um just as far
as like general scores I think we've
talked about this before I listen to the
Tron soundtrack Tron Legacy Tron Legacy
yeah yeah
donc music that's good like I'll just
put that out in the background while I
work and it like motivates me yeah
that's one where before the movie came
out you here dot Punk is doing the score
for Tron Legacy did you think and that
could not be more perfect right it's so
great yeah and I watched that trailer
for that movie so many times and that
music just like gave me goosebumps
yeah it's a great soundtrack hmm rich
Evans confirmed for checkers god it's
true checkers cut that's really true
another great soundtrack is Miami
connection of course
looks like Wando bands songs and that
are pretty amazing
I know some people who do Taekwondo and
they did not know about Miami connection
because of course who wouldn't they yeah
and I showed them the both of both the
friends forever song but more
importantly the against the ninja song
which has the course of time icon
Taekwon yeah Taekwondo they loved it so
hard that they are going to create a
weapons routine using that oh that's
great bag that I can go there and film
against the ninja yeah I think I stopped
listening to soundtracks I don't send a
lot of soundtracks in high school that's
always discovered a lot of bands so they
get jaronda that I eventually ended up
liking was through soundtracks because I
was more into movies than music so I buy
soundtracks I mean like oh I like this
song I'll get a bat will buy this band
oh sure sure sure and just like
everybody in eternity owned like the
Reservoir Dogs on track oh sure and the
pulp fiction is out of drag but that's
fine because those were good soundtrack
I had the the South Park movie
soundtrack yeah and I got it before the
movie came out so that entire summer
that was the soundtrack in my car that
was that we were just listening to that
constantly absolutely before the movie
and then so we saw the movie we knew all
the songs and then the rest of the
summer we were just listening to that
over and over I love that soundtrack I
love those songs that movie but that
movie was something special that's the
first movie I bought on blu-ray when I
got a blu-ray player really yep that's
funny get a blu-ray player higher
definition the first thing I got was the
South Park movie nice tent but is cheesy
God you know cutout animation white wins
congratulations

playing or Jevons they're firing returns

let's see here
you
what Oh what are you guys playing
tonight right now this is it we're
playing fucking checkers we we had
planned to play some FTL and for some
reason open broadcaster was twitching
out I don't think it was anything on my
computer because my game screen wasn't
flickering hmm but the open mind it's
not doing it for this it's not doing it
for this my game was it wasn't
flickering but my open broadcaster
preview screen was flickering and of
course the stream was flickering and I
tried messing around with some game
settings and that didn't seem to help so
I don't know what it was
have you guys ever been to the safe
house we live in Milwaukee so yes yeah
everybody's been in the safe house
everybody's been to the safe house it's
yeah you know what go once it's fun if
you have relatives from out of town
that's retaking taken to the safe house
yeah if you are planning a aah I went
there for as part of my bachelor party
bar crawl I'm sure they take they take
you they do something special oh yeah
so if you are planning a bachelor party
in the Milwaukee area take him to the
safe house and set it up it's it fun
okay that was a fun time and I used to
do open mic nights there oh yeah no you
know they did that there they well they
don't end up there anymore they used to
I see back in the day
uh you know so I've seen this a couple
times in the chat favorite Wes Anderson
film to me they're all the same I can
see that I've actually not seen a Wes
Anderson films since the Royal
Tenenbaums really yeah I haven't seen
you just you see the trailers and you
say oh that looks like more of the same
yeah I can understand that I like most
of his movies my favorite you mean seen
the life aquatic nope I love the life
aquatic beer Bill Murray fan you should
watch the life quad bill Marvin it's but
I'm I know when I would I best
soundtracks I would say that one to that
is very good yeah I know what I'm gonna
get you know and I don't think you do
though after that one I would agree with
you yeah but that one I want something
special I like that it would be a lot
okay that's got the the most emotional
core to it for me personally okay I
think most people say that about
probably Rushmore or Royal Tenenbaums
but the Bill Murray character that his
character in life aquatic like he's
really tragic and it's oh it's good it's
good okay I would really recommend you
know what I will give a life aquatic but
try okay
you should because of your
recommendation and ruled befoe is
hilarious in it he's got a supporting
role in and he's just funny oh good yeah
I have stayed away from of course you
know being someone who's into film I you
know sob Rushmore in love did Rushmore's
gray went back and saw bottle rocket got
it immediately it was just like oh man
yeah Tenenbaums is beautiful 10 mm
beautiful movie and then it and then I
saw the previews for Life Aquatic I saw
a little bit of the fantastic mr. Fox
since I have like I get it I get it I
can understand that I get what he's
going for and you know what he's got a
thing and that's great for him hmm
I'm just no oh I understand
let's go I'm glad you understand
you see my big this is my big travel
coffee mug that is huge yeah it's great
I fill it up with coffee and I filled up
with iced coffee
holy Lord that's a lot of iced coffee
yeah but it like I recently took a very
long road trip and so I filled this up
with iced coffee before I left and just
the entirety of the five-hour road trip
just slowly drank the whole Oh champ it
was great that way I lost you lost a lot
Oh No
happens every now and then was it a good
game that was good game okay
he got me fair and square Aaron squared
hmm that's good yeah oh they're seeing
it right now oh they're saying you
should rage quit hmm oh that's funny you
were the chosen one rich well yeah one
chance I can't play it on a game nope
uh no the Tusk trailer Oh have you seen
that J I haven't do you know about it I
haven't Smith's name of a No it's the
human centipede
it looks like the human centipede but
instead of making a human centipede he
makes a guy into a ball wrist that's
that's the premise of the movie great I
don't know you know what I'll say is I
appreciate that Kevin Smith is at least
trying different things because for a
while you'd see his movies it's like oh
it's more of the same you know and I'll
give him credit for that I think red
stain isn't have you seen red static god
no come on it's an interesting failure
as I'll describe it all right but uh and
then this is something completely
different so I don't know I'm just so
sick of him as a personality and I think
he needs to stop trying outside of the
box
no because here long to just make like
Jay and Silent Bob movies till the end
of time not chanson Babu is here's the
thing that I've always liked about Kevin
Smith I've let I've always liked him as
a writer and as a director he's I don't
think he's very good no because he was
meant to be a writer but I've always
thought that his movies were very
personal to him yeah and I've always
gotten them until he started veering off
course even Jersey girl yeah by God
which isn't as bad as a lot of people
make it out it's it's a small city very
small T it's a small T movie but you
know what he would he had just had a
daughter like you know it was a movie
about a father and a daughter it was
personal and I got that the one good
thing about that movie is George Carlin
yeah really good nut he's really good
it's it's not I mean it's not a great
movie I would even call it a good movie
it's not a good one but I under his feet
you'd see yeah it's fine and you know
what but but also like for him as a
writer and as a director it made sense
yeah he was doing a personal story um
then you get into stuff like the cop
boats in the red space cuff up is so bad
where he tries where he tries to go
outside of his box it's just like no
even clerks - I like clerks - actually
it's fine now you know what it was it
was a an allegory of what he was going
through and like it made sense yeah yeah
sometimes you got to stick to what you
know but now what he knows is smoking
pot all the time and I'm thinking things
are hilarious while he's smoking pot and
then making a whole script based on some
random idea he had he joked about and
you know maybe that's fine
that's what he's doing that's been
that's fine just maybe he should stop
directing things well then he he said
said he was gonna quit
didn't he retire like five years ago and
he just keeps making movies yeah it
doesn't it doesn't matter doesn't he do
like podcasts or something that's his
main thing his podcast yeah just let him
do that well yeah that's that but he was
gonna stop making movies now and just
focus on that stuff but then he just
keeps making these fucking movies
I don't know I don't know about him
obviously it's just like he was a very
important gateway for me as a 13 14 year
olds a gateway into other independent
movies so he certainly had a very
important purpose for everyone for a lot
of people of our age for everyone of our
generation yeah he he was the start of
it all yeah Jesus Christ you know he can
make a movie yeah yeah so is that easy
yeah well and then like with curses you
know rain interviews and hearing about
the movies that influenced him and then
going out you know looking at those
movies I discovered a lot of stuff
because of that movie oh no I'm just in
like discovering just like the
independent circuit you know like I
remember like very shortly after that
seeing el Mariachi yeah and just like oh
my god movies can exist this small this
is great yeah yeah
no it's all good things and you know
what I know a lot of people will
recently have been shitting on mall rats
the Moritz no I like Mallrats everyone
likes Mary Margaret is a cute kind of
throwback to the best times at ridgemont
high type team visit Kevin Smith grew up
when I saw I usually haven't watched it
in a really long time I have a feeling
it would not hold up that great that's a
good point I I did like it a lot when it
came I saw it as a teenager and loved
the shit out of it mostly cuz you see
Joey Lawrence Adam's boobs whatever they
go back to Shelley Duvall what happened
to Joey Lauren Adams she recently was uh
