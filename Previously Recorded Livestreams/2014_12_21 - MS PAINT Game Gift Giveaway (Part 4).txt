world for anyone who couldn't hear
Rachel is complaining about yeah this is
this is a big Christmas dream we're not
we're not going to stream on Wednesday
because it's Christmas Eve because it's
Christmas Eve why it's amusing that's
happening here during the big Christmas
stream and not during Rich's silent okay
only stream yeah I'll buy JP versus the
world I'm gonna pick a name you pick a
name yeah I'm gonna blame it on Ms pain
yeah I see some people in the chat have
mentioned that no I think that's really
the biggest culprit here I think you're
right I'm gonna say you're right the
world gets me
hmm yeah that's that's tough one dude do
each - yeah
what Josh Josh was on a stream now he's
on one stream one stream josh works a
lot yeah yeah people are asking what his
role in our arm is he comes behind he
watches stuff with us and he talks about
things that's what he does
not everybody you see on camera has a
full-time our om only thing they do some
of us gotta work but we're gonna try to
get Josh I have a great idea for the
next dream with Josh going up yeah I'm
not gonna say okay bud you fucking tease
it's true it's true but I've talked to
Josh about it and he's down now again I
don't know anything about this we're
gonna have a really fun time I do won't
be anytime soon
yeah yeah and it's that season where
people work co-op yeah yeah what the
fuck is Josh what the fuck is Josh he's
a human being is a person Jay yes
interesting question one of those two oh
sure I I would have a DP that knows how
to fucking use it I would not try to
choose something myself on it not right
anyway but absolutely there pretty yeah
yeah the red camera gets good images so
they make pretty pretty pictures
the Reds you know can be very affordable
yeah there's different models and stuff
so super nice with the Alexa though not
only do you need a DP you need like
three you need yeah this lenses and all
sorts of shit to keep track of so yeah
so when you're operating with a skeleton
crew no I would not want to but if I had
an actual crew absolutely right we go
now here's the thing is in an ideal
world I want to have to deal with camera
stuff at all I would prefer to not have
to worry about that
so we'll see we'll see what happens
we'll see what happens with what I hope
is my next film cut the four years later
when it's actually being made I mean are
we starting yeah okay rich is starting
by the way we're just gonna give her
over it for a little bit
sure is when you're dealing with a red
or no like so then you're talking about
dealing with a 4k post oh yeah yeah
which also means computer upgrades hard
drive upgrade
yeah that's a completely different now
that is really tough to deal with even
like even some of the budget cameras
like the Blackmagic Cinema cameras oh
yeah like those dealing even like 2.5 k
or four case isn't credibly they look
great huh okay here we go
rich is going
I've already forgotten rich is showing
me the card cuz I forgotten it I think I
forgot to okay I'm talking about cameras
oh yeah yes yes of course okay here we
go I love them don't you carry them this
looks like a South Park Canadian oh no
no you have the mouth never right before
the mouth that kind of did right right
gotta make sure these lines cross or I'm
gonna have paint spill over and
everything that's not good yeah hmm

funny now I see where you're going you
know what I'm doing yeah yep

they oh they haven't even seen another
they're singing just now we'll see who
gets it first now I see one guess that
is not a bad guess for where it's gone
so far it's not right but I can see
where they would get that conclusion
oh you're very wrong oh come on got it
go ahead
way to go cows they all come running out
naked problem of their shoulders I need
to re-watch Miami connection I haven't

Barrymore she started with your anymore
man
no cuz that's she's just standing there
I only know Adam Sandler's plain as
ukulele you draw it out that's right

letter yeah it's the only thing I know
about the movie apparently it words you
don't want to admit that you know fifty
first days I understand completely
I've seen it it's not good I've seen it
no we told people they could vote again
or they could guess again after after
four tries maybe now Davis won twice a
daivam maybe no more yeah don't be
greedy but are you gonna punish him for
being good at the game right no that's
what you're doing jack
you're punishing him for being good at
the game well you want other people to
get a chance all right well they do have
a chance they're just failing it's true
hey buy dope smoke
thank you for describing we very much
appreciate it okay so now now now it's
open everyone not just subscribers
anyone can guess 50 forced date song I
don't know it's not new jugular it just
seemed like in general people were
people were saying oh you won twice but
that's fine everything's cool
I think if anyone's genuinely upset that
someone won twice in mspaint pictionary
they might need to rethink what they're
doing with their time does this be
though maybe just maybe there are prizes
there's a lot riding on this we haven't
said anything about the Mercedes we're
giving away later oh my god who's up oh

be streaming on the 28th but it'll be a
normal either it'll be it'll probably a
hack and a half either from your Ridge
and the other ones skyping in a normal
Sunday stream next week but we are
taking Wednesday off yeah as it is
Christmas Eve time to stay at home and
drink we do Christmas on Christmas Eve
what happens when you have multiple
families to visit it's true Christmas on
Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day I
have 4 different places I have to go to
throughout the course of the two days
it's a giant pain in the ass mm-hmm as
the holidays should be I've already had
three Christmases already Jesus Christ
that's crazy
9 9 oh my god you like the first major
one I've had in a long time yeah my
brother he's he's getting serious with
some girl and some little filly well
she's been out of seven year old

I have a seven-year-old niece but it's
just like family yeah less than two
hours
she's like Jesus it doesn't take some
kids long doctor like get get attached
it's it's funny it's true by the way
you're right the next plank you review
crocodile brain as an insult has this
perfect ring to it it does yeah because
it is insulting but it's also silly yeah
so it's
like consummate you crocodile brain cuz
lion brain is supposed to be the same as
crocodile it is like lion brain and also
like crocodile brain is what he means
right yeah lion yeah but lion brain
doesn't sound as funny as crocodile
brain right yeah
but yeah I think in our in our universe
now lion brain is the good one if you're
okay right so you you've changed it up a
bit okay I mean if you're a crocodile
brain then you're not so smart I get it
I'm hip you're hip let's go that's great
okay that was rich so now we do Jake

randomized are you done are you just
completely making itself yes you can all

stream it's true I know some things
about management for one I could turn
your microphone all the way down now
really easily I could turn your
microphone down she find you which one
it was that's right you don't you guys
are gonna have you you know you know the
answer you're not gonna have any idea
what I'm doing
cuz I'm getting I'm getting crazy right
now oh my god no I don't know what

crazy
I have no I know you don't I know it is
this like an insight thing that some
people will get no what are you doing
you'll see baby all right a little
patience okay okay I'm playing the long
game that's we're not in a hurry so it's
okay people are mentioning movies in the
chat that I just want to watch now
though right killer clouds from outer
space the blob the Warriors these are
all great movies they have nothing to do
with what rich is doing but I want to
watch them shakes the clown directorial
debut of Bobcat Goldthwait
quick change the Marines directorial
debut also good movie than that no yeah
well if we're seeing them that's not
what it is
we're just saying them because we're you
have to do something well rich takes his
time doing something I have like let's
think Jay and I know the answer and we
have no idea what he's doing I have no
idea what's going on coach changed is a
beautiful good change is wonderful it's
a nice little movie I want to rewatch
that so you know it's just it cuz it's
not like normal Bill Murray it's like
very subtle comedies awesome great well
it was the start it was the very started
as sort of transitional period I suppose
yeah no yeah he does things but yeah
back in the day he was a goof ball one
one of you in the jet is just going to
randomly get this they're just gonna say
a movie title you know they know it has
nothing to do with it absolutely we're
watching by the way all your guys's
we're still watching on hasn't I you
know didn't close up gotta close it up
this is gonna be one key thing that I
haven't done yet okay one key thing oh
god what the fuck were open on the
bottom there where can I have it I think
rich might be trolling us the kids they
say trollee not sure he's trolling us
yeah bars that open up
stupid stupid lousy thing that's the
name of the movie stupid lousy thing
yeah that should be a name of a movie
that should be closed why did it spill
everywhere that doesn't make any sense
guys okay right right so far you're with
me okay nobody else with you no I'm not
even close to being with you here here's
where here's where if this either works
or doesn't wait this could not work no
no what it's a line in them I know what
it is I have no idea how really serious
oh yeah yeah nobody see if they respond
to our reaction if that helps them in
any way I don't know if it will but they
understand what you're doing now they
just need to figure out what movie it's
from Hey Oh
zap or zip I words got it
Goodfellas powers what a job what am i
clumb yeah what am I to you to come yeah
that abstract zap powers excellent good
good jobs their powers
Goodfellas jesus H Christ I don't know
if that was a shot in the dark or if you
really figured it out from that that was
people who haven't seen Goodfellas and
aren't familiar with it or even gonna be
even more convinced just know it is like
that mob a movie you know people know
the reference probably more than the
movie probably that's true and the end
by the way there's just a great drawing
in diplomacy that's a good clown yeah
how am i up this last round and this sub
only where is this the last this is the
last everyone okay so this is for
everyone again everyone gets to guess
for this time and then it'll be and then
I'll go rich I'll go in jail go again
okay well this is last everyone and then
there'll be one more round for someone
exactly okay can't keep track of these
things this is an everyone guess it's
kind of a step ladder perfect that's
great
okay never seen this movie but okay all
right here we go all right and we're off
a stepladder
prtscn saves a lot of people absolutely
alright alright
oh I remember what it was now I forget
the name but I remember it
