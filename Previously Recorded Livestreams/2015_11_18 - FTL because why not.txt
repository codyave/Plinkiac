Jack I think I'm a jerk
well yeah
all those skeletal snuggles would like
to donate to the church of Breen praise
be to Breen also when will you guys
watch this next two films I think I
think I want to wait to watch them on
camera like because I can only imagine
we will the Bremen Attica yeah the Breen
like Galactica yeah your knack to
Cabrini or the Breen star the Breen star
oh that's it what the Breen star we the
you know why were the Breen star why
because now we have to beat the game
better than anybody else has ever beaten
the game the breeze the Breen star flies
straight flies true here's a rule if we
can afford it yeah and the store has it
yeah we have to buy hacking I am
officially into this run we have to be
the best hacker the best hacker the best
hacker perhaps may the Breen Star fly
true and straights
and be the best be the best ever of
everything praise be praise breeze
praise praise breezes sold oh my lord
whoa gotta hydrate hydrate praise
breathe clothing has already come in
handy well of course it's cloaking wait
did you win yeah we hacked the ship it
was a blue option oh yeah yeah no then
there you go and there you go we should
do an FTL drinking game stream I don't
know how that would work gutter Punk not
very well because I don't drink one I'd
be rich you would have to drive me home
yeah yeah yeah what what's the game I
don't I don't know what um I don't know
what I don't know how the game would
work every time the FTL drinking game so
it needs to be something that happens
often enough but not all the time
every time a missile misses you take a
drink oh no at higher levels you'd be
dead this would be dead you'd be dead oh
one one drink for every oMG oh my god
then you guys would just be donating 50
cents over and over and over like that
every blue option take a drink the blue
options don't happen quite enough no
that's probably about right
you think it's decent amount of blue
options depending on depending on what
your crew is and what I equipment you
have okay
the reason I take the lot of time I take
the rubble the the unite of the
Federation Cruiser mm-hmm it's cuz it's
got a nice mix of crew that gives good
blue options hmm you get the the ng the
mantis man and the rock man right the ng
and the rock man come up in blue options
frequently okay like how many times a
run do you run into the station that's
on fire sure Rockman solves that how
many times do you run into the
quarantine plan
okay with the disease problem the ng is
the blue option for that okay so every
time we run into a blue option you take
a drink yeah every time a crew member
dies take two grand takes two drinks in
memoriam no we're not the rubbles in
this that's that's the fun thing about
FTL yeah is you are the Federation
fighting the evil rebels oh my god every
time you encounter a solar flare fuck no
oh god you know they're not as bad I've
come to hate the the ion ones more yeah
the ion flares are really bad those
fucking I am pulsing kill you right
you're right Batman voice that's true
though if oh shit that was not a good
hat in the oxygen room oh fuck
if we play the FTL drinking game we
would need the B remote
oh thank you waffle tale no I did not
change the game in twitch and I will do
that right now I'll do that right now
FTL FTL : faster FTL it looks like a
bird FTL an update and updated thank you
finish your drink
I don't think finish you drink when you
beat the game I like because you know we
have to make sure we get significantly
drunk that's the point of every drinking
yeah so you're drinking every blue
option two drinks for every death finish
your drink every time you run every time
you the rebels catch up to you you know
so if you ever if you're ever in rebel
territory finish finish your drink
because that only happens maybe what
once or twice a game
it depends no it does if I have a really
powerful ship if I think I've got a good
layout yeah I've got good engines then
get away fast
I might take an extra star or two before
doubling back to the exit just to gain
that little bit of extra resources
sure gambling that I will gain more from
like those two extra stars that I'll
lose but now you would have to also
calculate how drunk I am and I'm like
this is why this game would actually
work the best because rich wouldn't care
it's like oh no it's taking the drinks
yeah I would get you drunk with my not
giving a shit this this idea has a lot
of potential the the FTL drinking game
actually may be doing something stupid
coming down here oh okay Lord Belmont I
would like to send you thank you for the
tip I would like to send you a 15
megabyte file of the Hugo trilogy from
GOG it's like King's Quest and police
quest how can I send it if you have
Dropbox you could send us a Dropbox link
prereq at red letter media comm is our
email or that might just fit in an email
or if there's any sort of download thing
but a Dropbox is probably like that's
what I use or if you use Google Drive
that's also a good way to do it but the
Hugo trilogy I don't know what that is
do you know what the Hugo trilogy is we
don't know what it is the name of the
game destroy Jack Packers liver it's it
would yeah you know that's that's part
of the fun also I mean like I would I
would choose a a lower alcohol beer you
know I'd get a normal beer and and of
course I wouldn't you know I would take
a taxi home or rich would drive me home
to make sure that we do it safely
what if you finished a drink twice in a
row does that mean a whole bottle maybe
I don't know Chuck Norris dies of liver
failure jokes go nice okay okay
Chuck Norrises liver didn't give out
Chuck Norris was just filtering out the
weakness he's dead it's better than
nothing no no not me a human oh no it's
fine it's fine
no no it's no it's worse than nothing
okay the door show it's bad we want the
human under we ought to blow this thing
up and get the resources yeah we'll take
the human we can name somebody always
more crew always more we like we need
more crew members maybe you don't think
oh oh you know what yeah we don't have
shield so we don't really need another
crew member right now but yeah we got
one well he can man like the censors one
not he can prepare things I'm sure
things make me humans don't have any
special traits right they level up fast
you get really excited when you get it
like a mantis yeah man
John Keela wants to be named he said I
don't think I'm named John kilo and well
he said me okay and I said okay I
believe you jump in the line work your
body in time work your body rhyme okay I
believe you

the time check check
work is the next word I don't give a
shit I my girl's name is Turner de I
tell your friends are you daughter when
she meant it Amanda singing baritone
but can't afford it no none of those
will work can't afford it go up that
ship and got the resources maybe we'd
have enough to afford the the energy was
Olten
dragon as a store but I can't afford
hacking if they have hacking
unfortunately I have no money that's all
right I got something that's all right
do it do it get on the boat and a banana
boat maybe if we can get back her time
we can buy a flak we have to get money
there's a quest we need money
there's a quest what's that the quest I
don't know but we need 32 scrap from
this to make to get that flag there's a
flak because a flak at that store that
we couldn't afford yes there's a flak
nothing matters except for getting that
flak and this war our extra guy comes in
handy

okay we can die you get that you have is
just water just normal
non-alcoholic water that's for sure
um I don't know I don't know how many
max landis stories we want to share
tonight you know what he's he's he's a
decent guy he's really decent guy I was
I mean much for first of all anonymous
says late arrival so this might be
redundant info but whatever other
streamers tend to have a higher minimum
tip amount to prevent most of it going
to PayPal yes I know
and what we're work on that but thank
you it's it's if we tried to set that up
for some reason it didn't take it didn't
take yeah I was very worried about about
max landis coming you know much like I
was worried about Len coming where it's
just like I are they just hear that I
mean Len I was worried about actually
physically beating us up yeah I well I
wasn't worried about him beating us up
you know what I thought might happen
with one what obviously he wouldn't do
this cuz once we met him we found out
one's a super ultra amazingly cool guy
yeah but before we actually met him
after we trashed his fucking movie and
career we were afraid he was gonna like
take the money for the ticket and have
us pay for the hotel room and then just
not get on the plane
right we're gonna show up the airport to
pick him up and just nothing yep that's
what we thought might happen or like he
would fly here and then just like be
silent Len when were meeting I'm
supercool would never do that
totally professional man but we didn't
know what he was gonna be like before we
met up so so so max came into town after
a little Twitter back and forth after
Jay and Mike's American ultra review and
and you know if anyone has ever seen max
landis on anything one thing I can
confirm is that man talks all right so
many in the chat is talking about max
Landis's ego here's the thing what
you're interpreting is ego after meeting
him is just high energy the man is like
really passionate about whatever the
fuck it is he's talking about he cares
about it it's true but he was not like a
dick at all
No so readily no probably a nice guy
really cool he's a talker yeah you know
when he was very big talker you just let
he likes to tell stories almost as if
telling stories is what he does for a
living like he was all excited to show
us his comic book
oh he showed us we got a special sneak
peek at Superman American alien issue
number 2 he was super excited to have us
read it and we talked about it we
chatted about comics we cared about we
chatted about all sorts of random nerd
stuff max was an incredibly nice guy
yeah incredibly incredibly nice guy and
yeah you just talked just talker but you
know what once you once you figure out
how he talks it's really easy to get in
the conversation with him because he'll
he'll be the first to tell you like oh
if you have something to say just stop
me from talking or else I'm gonna talk
so I'm like once you figure out his flow
the conversation was great
yeah I really liked hanging out with him
his comic was good issue too like if
anyone has read American alien issue one
issue to is is I like this YouTube
better than issue one we have no hacking
we have no hacking that's alright did
you get the flack and I'm totally
getting the autumn no but this cave but
you got the fact flat cannon yeah I
would not have been able to afford the
automated reloader
which is going to kick ass as it will
make our giant super laser fire faster
oh okay we're doing good cool who is max
landis max landis is a screenwriter he
most notably wrote American ultra and
Chronicle also the son of John Landis
famous direct famous director of like
half of all of the good eighties movies
Blues Brothers mmm coming to America
thriller Michael Jackson's Thriller
right Trading Places Animal House like
classic classic comedy director so yeah
just just a stand-up dude he wasn't he
wasn't here for long but stand-up dude
and fun to hang out with them
you know and we did we did talk about
American I'll try here's I like enriched
and I talked about this a little
beforehand I still have not seen either
Chronicle or American or Chronicle I
watched before he came in because I
figured I should see some of his stuff I
liked Chronicle actually a lot yeah I've
heard I've heard really good things
about Chronicle I have not seen either I
didn't want to see if it goes like the
phone footage film yeah it's fine it's
great and that's the thing the only
thing I knew max landis from is he has
two really amazing web videos called the
the what are the birth and death of
Superman the turn of the death and
rebirth of something yeah what is it
called
does someone know what that one's called
did someone say it the death of Superman
it's it's this amazing wet web video
talking about how DC Comics killed off
Superman and he also has a video called
wrestling isn't wrestling that's in the
same style of that and I knew I know
nothing about wrestling and I don't know
anything about modern wrestling so I
would it be worthless for me to watch no
here's the thing I know nothing about
wrestling it's still a very entertaining
video you know I max has the ability to
talk passionately about wrestling and
like I don't the death and redeath of
Superman right the death and return of
Superman is the other video so the death
and return of Superman and wrestling
isn't wrestling I keep wanting to say
like the the death of Superman Returns
because the documentary no that's not it
that's right
but they're both fantastic web videos
and that's what I didn't even know he
was a writer until a little bit ago I
think until they did their American
ultra view it's like oh that hey I know
that guy he made YouTube videos and
they're like no he's like a screenwriter
blue event somebody is doing a drinking
game that was a blue of a living take a
drink
great but no it was a good guy and we
had some interesting conversation
about screenwriters and final movie
products in general that were very
interesting
Lord Belmont sent you the the Hyuga file
in Google Drive okay great
thank you we'll look into that
okay so Mordor I want to take out this
weapon I'm probably always go for the
weapons always go for the weapons so
because I'm only doing damage to two
rooms okay that's why not sure
so here ultime sir I'm gonna I'm gonna
give you some real talk here about
haircuts because you know everyone talks
about his haircut max landis his haircut
look at me right now look at my head if
you have hair you can do whatever the
fuck you want with it that is the truth
about people with hair I don't I don't
care what you do with your hair if you
got it make it work if he's happy with
his hair whatever his heinous of goofy
hurt its goofy hair it doesn't matter
he's happy with it he's happy one but
it's goofy hair this is Riyaz oh shit a
real talk about about people with hair
they can have whatever haircut they want
I put him in the wrong room is what I
did I'm laying down some truth that's
right you think it's stupid it doesn't
matter he's got it I didn't I did dumb
and I deserve what I get the cloak
apparently you did son of a bitch
this is what happens when I do anything
other than 100% concentration on the
game I'm playing everything goes to fuck
right well get get it together maybe you
could do that maybe you could do a
little bit of getting it together
so yeah in any case in nothing matters
he was a nice guy
we nerd talked a lot because he's also a
nerd and very passionate about movies
and son of a bitch
that hurts i lumpy head a new plan
uh-huh we're getting the fuck out of
here fucking asshole
that's kind of what he's
that's kind of that's kind of his thing
rich you can do it deep breaths how did
we meet max landis he came he came out
to chat with us because Jay and Mike
didn't much care for American ultra yep
rich shouting at the game drink
the official drinking game rules are
every time there's a blue event you
drink every time a crew member dies you
drink twice and every time the rebel
fleet catches up with you finish oh my
god
hearing it
calamity Corp says hearing your angelic
singing voices you guys should do a sing
star type stream sometimes I only assume
that's like a karaoke tech game fuck no
yes absolutely absolutely over my dead
body
Jack would you be happy to have a
one-on-one interview with Phil Spencer
he's the main xbox ad man uh no because
he's probably way better at interviews
than me and knows how to spin it in his
direction and wouldn't answer any of my
questions
yeah cuz that's his job there's no point
in doing an interview with a marketing
guy unless you're gonna show that for
them because either they're gonna refuse
to do the interview right or spend the
entire interview Schilling and it's like
and obviously if they're like you know
working for Microsoft they're probably
good at their job you want a live-action
roleplay stream also never going to
happen
contrary to what some of you might
believe I have never
role-played a day in my life it has
never happened you know always felt
silly but I tried it like once it is not
for me not is not for me dear I yeah or
live action robot no that never at all
never happened at all it's not my scene
yeah yeah probably not that's right
Phoenix if the ship dies you lose four
crew and that equals eight drinks so get
with it rich that's and they're saying I
have no imagination maybe I have too
much imagination to want to put rules on
my imagination too limited thought about
that but rick pissed off mofo says this
acting equals role-playing I'm not an
actor I've never claimed to be an actor
isn't I'm just some goofy man whose
friends keep throwing him in front of a
camera despite the fact that I died on
camera
every time rich is a fantastic actor he
refuses to believe it which maybe that's
part of his power you know and and tired
and sad oh we need engines we've talked
about this about like how max can come
across like pretentious and/or entitled
he's just a he's a he's an upbeat guy
yeah really that's it he's just excited
about the things he talks about I think
we're just well he came up there so they
have to say nice things he was very very
nice guy he talked a lot he talked a lot
don't you know like it wasn't it wasn't
obnoxious though it was extremely
passionate about the thing about about
everything yeah that's no so I but I can
see how he would come across that way
obviously like I'm super best friends
with him now so I think I can I think I
can talk about this obviously I spent
and I can I can talk about the time I
spent in the day but no I I want to say
he's a cool dude all right we have to
save this run Jack mm-hmm
the CIM accent says if I came to
Milwaukee for tourism could you make any
recommendations don't come to Milwaukee
fish yeah
what that's why there's problem you know
I love this city but there's probably
better places to go if you come if you
if you are music person come axion I'd
say come rich praise be to breezes
praise to the Breen a flak cannon he has
descended on us by the Breen by the
Breen has gifted Aflac if your music
person come during the summer and come
to Summerfest because Summerfest is
great you get to see a hundred live
bands in one day and you know drink
during the day and being a massive
people and watch great music so
Summerfest is great there's not you know
we have a decent Museum we have we have
some really great restaurants but
anywhere you go is gonna have great
restaurants we will never surrender any
one of our crew members to slavers these
scum except for waffle Hill what sorry
waffle tale but I think we can take them
so you're okay I don't know like I guess
if you're like if you're coming here for
like work or coming here for some other
reason there's or else like again during
the summer instead of coming here go up
to like Wisconsin Dells and then you
know you could go like they have they
have shit to do up there
in Milwaukee it's not so much
woo stick stick stick alright how we
name this person Jack what's subscriber
we've done a lot of anybody so let's get
a subscriber this stick is a important
character what what here's here's the
trivia question okay what can what can
Neal Breen do that's the question
it's a very simple answer yeah yeah okay
what can eat what what is he the best at
what is Neal Breen
the best at you know the answer and I
see it as Oh bother
neoprene is the best at everything
Neal Breen can do everything
oh the brainís breezes we do we Maki
does have cheese curds Milwaukee has you
know we have a we have a couple really
fantastic brewery tours if you're a beer
person you could you could take like
four or five brewery tours without
leaving downtown Milwaukee and a lot of
them give you free drinks while you're
on the tour and that's great
so if you're a beer person then you come
to Milwaukee
they do not have hacking that's okay
Neal Breen is a filmmaker who makes some
amazing movies and rich and I recently
saw one of his amazing movies it's not
our job to teach you culture
but it is our job to spread the word of
breezes part of being a disciple of our
Lord Breen is to spread the word of
Breen he is it's a Phil he's a filmmaker
he makes films the quality of which is
not up for debate
he makes them he's a film maker
what debate what debate could that
possibly be there's no debate he's great
at everything he's been he's the most
perfect at everything he's Twitter thing
back and forth
oh no Max's Twitter thing was was just
he watches half in the bag and he got
really excited when they did American
ultra yeah and he was he was super
passionate about something and surprise
surprise he liked American ultra because
he wrote him and disagreed with Jay and
Mike because they didn't much care for
it and wanted to have an in-person
conversation with them that's the a
waffle oh wow oh he's fine the person
there was dead they said okay oh good
Jesus but he can fight this guy sweet
breeze this waffle gotta be careful of
those old friends a week is fuckin yeah
yeah
fucking borders always always an
adventure with the stealth Cruiser it's
always an adventure when you're
traveling with Breen on the Breen storm
storm on the Breen star there's nothing
but adventure luckily were the best at
everything
why did Jay tweet Neal Breen
do they need his permission to stream
what is Jay tweeting at Neal Breen
because Neal Breen is the greatest so
maybe he just wanted to tweet at someone
who's the greatest he's the greatest and
best at everything that he's ever done
Oh can you guys not hear the game audio
they're asking for louder game audio
rich great riches in the middle of
something and I'm looking up what Jay is
tweeting it Neal Breen keep getting
fucking borders maybe you could deal
with it isn't it is dealing with it
fucking cold it's usually to go
new SHM you schmuck look it up we're
gonna yes no oh no no so J's J retweeted
one of a classic Breen tweet classic me
a brain tweet and his tweet was no
because this is a true thing go check
out neo Breen's Twitter right now he
does not know how to reply to people and
so he answers people's questions but
without replying to them he just answers
them as tweets and so you'll see on his
Twitter feed he just says stuff like
maybe in a couple weeks was that me Neal
we don't know look we just don't
understand the complexity of his tweet
because he's our the best in tweeting I
guarantee you that I am not wholly
convinced that both Neal Breen and the
movies that he makes are not some sort
of Adult Swim art project if we want to
think about this in reality his movies
are too perfect and he as a character as
a person is too perfect
this could be the next big long comic
what asteroid oh you don't got no
shields may the power you're gonna need
that fuck
so it's it could be possible that Neal
Breen's persona and movies are nothing
but a long con brought on by like Adult
Swim midnight programming o breeze be
with me may the breeze be with you if we
can't do a cross with with breezes what
do we do with breezes maybe like a like
a like a triangle
everything so oh you know what it is
it's a triangle with a circle around it
so triangle circle because that's
everything you got this you've fucking
got this rich you took out their engines
that means they're not dodging which
means their shields are going down soon
he we're fucked
we're so fucked
Oh your weapons just went down what
about your flax you got the flax Jack as
my co-pilot and the breezes is mine oh
we're so fuck Oh God so fucked run away
oh you can't you're piloting oh fuck get
them drinks ready how many crew members
we got now you have five that's ten
drinks coming up people fix that shit
nope nope I hate everything oh god oh
god then your flex aren't doing shit
rich I would like to share a story the
Breen tests us I would like I would like
to share a passage from the brain yeah
go ahead from breezes please show me a
passage from the book of breeze from the
book of breezes sabrine as Neil has
written I am I was a master jet fighter
pilot and I've won all the medals and no
government could stop me
even if they wanted to because I control
anthrax
but you're forgetting you're forgetting
the the message of tweet 137 okay I'll
get back to you next week and doesn't
that just mean that we need to try again
yes he will be there and he will be
there because he's always there because
he's the best at everything
praise be to brainís reasons you
mentioned when you mentioned that he was
might be an elaborate Adult Swim hoax
yeah I thought about it I honestly
thought about like oh my god that makes
much more sense than him being
legitimate but I chose to not believe
that and at that moment hmm I knew what
it was like to have religion because
homo jakes almost certainly right breed
is almost certainly of a faith I'm not
gonna believe it
because oh he's real he's real the
simplest explanation and and common
logic dictates that he's a fake you know
this is it's an art installation that
would make far more sense than he him
being a legitimate crazy person making
films right but you've decided to throw
logic aside completely aside logic and
reasoning is out the window because you
hold on to the thing I want to believe
you want to believe that Breen is real
and that's the power of breezes all
right here's the question I think I mean
we owe these people some more time
because the last stream was a little bit
short sure so do we do another round of
FTL or something you want to play I just
love my triangle move do you want it you
might just do rocket League good what do
you want we could do some rocket League
that would you know do some rocket labor
you know why cuz rocket League is only
four on the list and and I love rocket
League I love rocket leagues so much
and you've already eaten it at FTL so
much yeah oh good well I have to be fair
I've been choosing ships um I don't use
this often just for sure shake it up oh
sure
