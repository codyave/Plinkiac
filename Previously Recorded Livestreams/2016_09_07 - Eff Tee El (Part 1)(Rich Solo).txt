I switched off oxygen because it was
trying to power up that missile but
apparently I don't have enough juice to
weapons in general to do that
there is no escape my friend all right
well we gained something we should all
be proud
five missiles back for one fuel and then
we only got the laser and a missile
launcher so far not really don't like
giving up fuel I'll do it this time

spiders leave them alone I mean I've
known Mike a long time we've laughed
about a lot of things nothing specific
that I can recall though jiminy cricket
get cricket prick bastard also says
isn't repairing / upgrading your ship
with parts you salvaged from a different
kind of ship you just blew up kind of
like repairing your Toyota with Parks
from a BMW you just ran off the road

it down and and remoulding all the parts
how do you know that huh huh an answer
for everything can't trip me up Jiminy
Cricket print bested all right did
anyone those two distress beacons were
fucking shit I didn't get the blow
anything up and I had to stay away from
danger because they were crappy crappy
things all right we got some stuff from
that one there's better than oven
we are going to desperately need some
other type of weapon rather desperately
when you Jiminy Cricket brick busted
blow that ship up
oh I'm not an auto oh fuck that blue
sorry i thought i had i thought i had
that targeted i did not did not didn't
take much damage

way to health and beauty come from uh I
don't remember if that was a thrift
store fine or if someone sent that to us
that may have been her early someone
sent that to us but I honestly don't

other room somewhere I probably ought to
close my doors and no not yet go back to
the healing room we got to close the
doors close the fucking doors did a
thing you know that thing that closed

behind he couldn't get here he just
wanted to start later I mean I wasn't
like one think he was supposed to be

know what don't worry about i'll just
get an earlier start show up when you
free all right we probably have oxygen
now
I hate nebulous
all right now mrs. rich tipped a few
weeks ago and asked about the best of
the worst bit you had and you said
everything on best of the worst was
simply made up and not scripted so I
guess Mike really smashed your diabetes
medicine you fuck are are are people too
dumb not to tell the difference between
the opening skipped skiz sketch which by
the way there wasn't a printed script we
would like talk about what we're going
to do ahead of time for that can you not
tell there's a difference between that
and what's going on at the table I
vostro yeah 15 says hey rich I asked
this question at work I thought it would
be interesting to hear your point of
view when was the first time you had non
dial-up internet I remember it like it
was yesterday I don't know was available
one day I think and we we asked to get
it that was it and then we had then we
had non dial-up internet it was great by
the way and you've never had to deal
with a 56k modem count your blessings
those things were horrible but I mean
there's not like a an amazing a dial-up
free story I have it was great it was
great because dial up this is literally
the it's the fucking worst it's the
fucking worst missiles for bas i'm not
using bots so
well I want to get to that store I hope
we'd make money on our way to that store
but this fucking nebulous all suck hey
from the few from future famous person
says is Jack spirit replacing your beard

probably going to grow mine back or at
least something resembling a beard is we
need to name somebody pick a random
cheddar gobbledygook you have randomly

continue crew ship crew DC online is
free dammit
you know who you are you know who you
are DC you would have been 11 letter too

you exasperatedly having to pause the
game and reach over to grab the laptop
awkwardly with one hand for something
not very important hi hey that was funny
I was worth that let me try DC you free
save it save it has room let's got room

something resembling a beard fund and
also the random chatter naming d rigging
fund wow thank you thank you much yeah
is this gonna be a fuckin watching a
burst laser too and I'm going to be
short ol is only as I'll crap
anonymous says I'm sorry I totally
understood the whole scripted thing but
I wanted to see how frustrated you get
at such a stupid question just wanted
you to know that your audience isn't
that stupid go Trump we had it here
first folks all right all right
now that stores there I need to ignore
the station I need money at a decent
laser
now
damn it didn't work out the way I water
now learning is fine
alright that's enough for a decent
weapon should they have one so we're
going to the store
oh you're right i'm not using yeah i got
a man the so crew people here that was
dumb
hmm her arm yeah yeah drone control
no I need something that's got a week in
shields hacking if i could get hacking
that'd be great don't have any of those
things for me all right you're finding
you stupid you're horrible stop yeah
and oh yeah arrest remember what can be
man that's not a waste shields you don't
want to put zoltan's if you can help it
in a room like piloting like I need to
because there's no one else to pilot the
ship but Zoltan and piloting that's a
that's a waste of energy because
zoltan's power something in that room
and piloting doesn't require additional
power just dead Zoltan in there you're
not getting anything extra out of that
same with the dope do ya outdoor sauna
power doors or sensors it's a waste jump
oh no pirates oh no can I take your flak
can you can you give just give me your
flak I'll take it

I'll deal with it yes
perfect
game sound is quite as i hear it's craig
dub now

spend too much so it's chi I still need
a weapon that will complement the
halberd actually I need that desperately

jiff okay anonymous's I'd a long day at
work now I get to be stoned and watch

anymore that's terrible
a mercy not found
classic rich that was terrible I was
trying though I could again I get an A
for effort I get a I got a b-minus for
effort
anonymous says two dollars all for rich
none four Jack two dollars of money
money money now miam money a lot now
thank you thank you very much oh yeah
thank you very much again you can't
grade yourself I just did stop me sure
I'll do your stupid quest that probably
sucks shit shit this is why we need some
kind of burst laser we're gonna be
fucked quickly now unless we can find
something I need something decent to
complement this fucking halberd and it
had to be great has to not suck
we're so fucked
all right we're gonna wait to the fire
go out I don't hear anything that's
probably I'm closing doors that is a
shitty encounter
thank you missiles aren't necessary
there in a day other weapon I have other
than the halberd right now which is bad
and that I can do about that missiles
are I don't know possibly my least
favorite weapon in the game
oh by the way on the YouTube yesterday
you know I thought the the antics are
thing had killed them but I didn't watch
it yet I saw a new episode of Star Trek
oh you fucking you fucking bitch
why would you do that why would you do
that ah Star Trek continues was a well
is I guess it still is I thought it was
dead because of the Star Trek and acts
are fiasco I was a star trek I still is
I guess a Star Trek fan show where they
they kind of make their it's like it's
like if the original 1960s Star Trek had
never stopped and they're like making
more episodes it's done they do them
entirely in the style of the classics
like to the sense done to the lighting
they got what's-his-face Scotty's actual
kid trying to blank on the actress damn
name and I feel terrible about that but
it it's good it's fun it feels like
classic Star Trek and after paramount
kind of squashed Star Trek fan films
that shit I thought the show was doomed
but it looks like they put a new one up
James Doohan Thank You Chad Thank You
Chad
brace 110 you you haven't been watching
our streams long have you I love be some
Star Trek love me some Star Trek
the one from Misbah thermos busters
Grant Imahara Grant Imahara plays Sulu
in Star Trek continues and he's horrible
he's well-meaning but he's absolutely
terrible jazz lab I know you're just
fucking with me can't beat me like that
all right
store because I desperately need some
firepower
nothing nothing absolutely nothing fuck
fuck we're going to die because I can't
find anything better than this shitty
little fucking missile launcher
well there was absolutely nothing
sarcastic about jerking off the star
wars droid
kill those shields kill those shields
fuck my life
Grand Moff Kali says truck ed Truckee
did you ever get into any get into any
of the Expanded Universe esque books
there is the predictable dreck but some
actually good star trek content there I
not ever did maybe I should someday I
don't know but I never did
did rich just say fuck my wife then just
say it
no there is no clown sitting next to
bait
alright everything's healed good give me
a fucking burst laser or something I can
use to defend myself
I need to save my muscles and run I
think
now of course not of course you have
extra slots and your fucking shield so
one doesn't take your shields out of
course of course
and of course that laser is not going to
charge up fast enough they're going to
fix their shields they could be
impenetrable yeah you're going to die
with dignity for what that's worth
kabbala gut says wrench have you ever
read the Star Trek next generation and
expand on in the early 90s called Planet
X and it's storm says there is an
uncanny resemblance between Picard and
Professor X that's a cute reference was
that out not only receta that was a
comic book wasn't it I didn't read it
but I remember when it came out I
remember thinking what an odd crossover
in Traverse says also had a very long
day at work now I have a very long
erection because you're streaming flock
my flock also play darksiders if you
haven't okay
hello
we need to see if that's Jack or
somebody else hold up oh that is Jack
