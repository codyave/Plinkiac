I think earlier they thought streaming
this game would get more views than the
Super Bowl well we just figured we just
figured okay this is what I want to do
alright this is the this is what I'm
hoping for
yeah this is a good combination so this
card lets me choose any other card and I
add three copies of that card to my hand
next time next time right then I have
this card which costs zero to use that
does for damage and applies weak to the
enemy so I can make three copies of this
put in my hand next I make them super
weak and deal a little bit of damage
this is you know this is this is this is
the mad strats here great and I still
get to use it this turn as well
yeah look at this
now he's super weak attacks deal 25%
less damage for seven terms that's gonna
be very helpful and did a little bit of
damage it's great it's great
we like that perfect we're rocking it
I'm gonna get I'm gonna get a little
damage but we're rockin so now he's
poisoned yes
he's weak so now I can just concentrate
on my defense oh my god I get to keep
all those copies fuck yeah rich so now I
can just concentrate on my defense while
I just slowly murder him that's great
that's a great comment that's what
you're hoping for in a deck building
game you want to find find the combos so
what what are the differences between
the different characters you each
character gets kind of their card set
and this one is all about poisoning and
and stat adjusting your enemies whereas
the other one is more just about
attacking kind of the other one is is
the starter character your general
attack defense yeah this one is about
poisoning and you know manipulating and
whatnot there's another character in the
character selection screen that is not
yet available okay so this is only two
right now there's only two okay and the
more you play the more stuff you unlock
you know classic classic rogue life you
unlock this you unlock that more cards
and where are they are they even in the
game yet because I know this is early
access what those other characters know
the other character is not even
is it like literally has a screen that
says not available yet so is this like a
deck building FTL it exactly that's a
that's exactly what it is it's it's it's
that's a good way to put it yeah just
deck building Jack to play hearthstone I
have played hearthstone why aren't you
all about the hearthstone that's the
deck building game hearthstone
is a deck building game hearthstone is
also stupid pants kind of so-so
hearthstone is player versus player
right yeah but it's also a free game but
the more you play hearthstone the more
cards you can unlock or you can pay
money to unload pay to win it can be
oh it's either pay to win or the more
you play it the just the more options
you have and then the the more the
better cards you will have the better
equipment you will have and they do have
matchmaking but I just wasn't that into
it this to me is a little more
streamlined its deck building game but
you're facing you know like there's a
ramp up in challenge much like any other
roguelike you know you the first level
is pretty easy of ramps up ramps up
ramps up yeah so Izzie hey behind it no
no that's um that's Blizzard hearthstone
is Blizzard the other the other bigwig
in loot boxes they know they know what
they're doing loot box wise lizard in
gaming is passed me by Jack you think
loot boxes microtransaction I've I have
no one she's in any of that ship and i
won
I don't even me I don't even need to
attack him I just will one feel good
about this feeling good about this from
whenever an enemy dies
that could be good
great
you know I loot boxes are one of those
things it's it's the downside is so
inevitable and so obvious and we just
need to remember that there will be a
counterbalance mm-hmm
like we're going hard loot boxes right
now but there there's also the other
side of the equation which is games like
this like independently develop the game
sure we have more games now than we ever
have and more niche markets and more
single person game development teams or
small game development teams and also we
have the giant people that are ripping
off everyone and taking advantage of
addictive behavior can I say something
nice about Naughty Dog as related I know
I know
look I don't I don't like their style of
heavily cinematic above everything else
for the sake of being highly cinematic
yeah but they make complete
single-player experiences you know a
little bit of devil's advocate there I I
do appreciate that about Naughty Dog
well you may not necessarily like their
single-player right right hey that was
nice
how's that feel how they feel being a
little positive being being positive
towards Naughty Dog did that hurt or no
logical conclusion it's tough it's
stuffing you know the the the honesty is
loot boxes are not going away well
probably not we'll see if the law steps
in but they probably won't until the law
steps in they are not
going away because yeah well I think
this was the thing that like Rockstar
brought to light right where it's like
1% of their user base are providing them
with 90% of their revenue from loot
boxes yeah it's insane how few people
are fueling this industry and how much
money they're making from it mm-hmm
but but it is and even overwatch which
you know does the loot boxes but it's
only cosmetic stuff and it doesn't
really matter it's still and you know
like I obviously I'm I'm a little biased
because I love overwatch yeah and I
don't my loot boxes so it doesn't matter
to me but I understand that they are
also taking advantage of people who have
addiction problems and that's all it is
it's it's gambling math people want the
new thing and they want like they they
they they get that dopamine hit from
opening the loop box I just want another
hit they want another hit and they're
taking advantage of people who might not
be able to control their spending habits
to get a little real it'll real get a
little harsh
rocket League rocket Lake does the same
thing yeah again you don't need any of
those any of those keys to open up the
loose boxes right we're gonna meet him
for gameplay you don't need them for
game playing but oh you can you kind of
want that special goal explosion you
want the special hat topper don't you
I'd respect these things much more if
you could just spend the money to buy
the thing you want you can i buy that
topper No
yes see you have to buy the box that may
or may contain it's a shitty it is
shitty it is shitty but they they
learned it from casinos right they
learned it Oh people who have already
making a ton of money off of this stuff
I have in the recall
all the content is available to earn
without paying anything if you want
what's it like 60,000 hours worth
playtime well and see that that's what
what what you're doing here
by the way it's oh by the way you are
absolutely correct it like in overwatch
for example cuz that's just the game I
know you you you can earn free loot
boxes right and you know you put your
place so much you do the better you do
in game the more experience points again
you get a free loot box every time you
level up right and you're absolutely
right but what that also is is um the
first ones free and any corner Street
any corner drug dealer will tell you you
want to give the kids their first taste
for free
worth there weren't there people in
rocket League who would literally put
like a rubber band on the analog stick
and tape down like the gas button yes
and they'd be just let it run for hours
they would make kick for being idle yeah
yeah just just to grind for those loot
boxes but that's what you want you want
it you want to give the kids their taste
oh hey you just got you just got an epic
skin and you got it for free heart loot
box is great
don't you want more don't you want
drug-dealing 101 give them the first
taste for free then they come back for
more deal with it
poison eise
that was battlefront - I'm sure it was
rocket League - because I remember
people did that in rocket League yeah
that's I mean that's any game people
people will fight they used to have when
when Team Fortress 2 had had their you
know Box system there were actually
specific idol servers this is a thing in
tf2 and so what you would do is you'd go
to these idol servers and what they
would have because like there there were
certain conditions and Team Fortress
this was back in the day yes yeah there
are certain conditions that not only did
your character have to move but you had
to like die so often what if you're just
good and didn't die or well there's but
you'd be moving there were some there
was there were these certain things that
you had to meet so they would make idle
servers with custom levels that would
have a conveyor belt conveyor belt this
is a real this is a real thing rich they
would have a conveyor belt that took
your character into like a meat grinder
so then you would respawn and because oh
wait ok you know why because the way
that Team Fortress 2 used to do their
boxes was for every death you had a
chance every death you had a chance to
get a box but you had to keep moving to
die and so they would keep going to
conveyor belt and put you in a meat
grinder and so people would turn would
go into an idle server at night and then
you get 12 hours just meat brining that
was tf2 like a year and a half look
boxes folks look boxes
people are really innovative when it
comes to getting free shit it was great
it was great
they did it for hats it was well
whatever it was they I remember go
because like I remember like visiting
one of these servers just to see what it
was all about and I just did not get it
it was great I win you are dead now
they weren't idling for well oh that's
right they weren't oh sorry yeah yeah
you're bringing bringing it over so they
weren't idling for loot boxes yeah at
with every death you had a chance to get
a weapon drop okay and then you could
take those weapons and turn them into
hats similar yeah it's similar principle
I remember Allah yeah yeah and so like
you would put you going the Idol server
and then the next morning you would wake
up you know check on your game and just
like see all the shit that you got is it
was amazing amazing times lost in
technicolor says haven't compulsively
tipped you guys in a few months take my
money
just take it thank you okay storm
Templar says Jack and rich here is a
reason that lose loot boxes are a thing
now there's a link keep in mind there
has not been an increase in game prices
since 2006 all right
again the doesn't change the fact that
they're making shitty games now that are
just excuses to gamble and give up money
well and if you want to if you want to
look at it from a legislative point of
view the worry that people have with
these loot boxes is that they are taking
advantage of people who don't have
necessarily the mental capacity not to
buy them people with addictive
tendencies our loot box is taking
advantage of people's addiction however
you slice this yeah whatever their
reasons are we're still in a situation
where Triple A games are a thing I'm not
interested anymore
yeah I know this is a cost too high for
making games but they make shit games
now that are just loot box gambling
games I don't care I don't care about
that
fucking nice yeah I'm pretty good
what about blood-borne - I'm sure we
fine I'm not saying they make literally
nothing I'm interested in but their use
there was a day there was a day this in
the past
hahaha there was a day when there would
be multiple titles a year I was
interested in multiple titles a year now
I'm lucky if there's one every other
year that I love there was a day last
triple a game
I loved probably doom 2016 ok yeah
that's a good one I think you know but
even thinking on those lines yeah
obviously I'm a big fan of overwatch
even you know Dishonored 2 was a really
fun play a player experience when was
that
yeah disorder 2 before doom wasn't it
was I think it might have been around
dude yeah but your breath of the wilds
fine breath of the wild was fine wasn't
really going to horizon zero dawn I
really enjoyed that was a big triple-a a
big triple layer there still out there
what No More Heroes 3p considered a
triple-a I highly doubt that a big it's
a triple a new No More Heroes small
developer cold suit of 50 world hits
suda51 that's not triple-a but it's not
triple-a but it's it's like what do you
what do you call someone in the minors
who's ready to move up like what do you
call someone in the minors who's ready
to move up but doesn't want to he's
right there
that's the worst that was fine yeah that
was fine
I'm sorry this is really good but I'm
dressed in the wild bred the wild yeah
but that was good
my breath oh well I think they're
they're still good to be had in the
triple-a market they're still good to be
had
from from Nintendo but they're still
very they're still very old-school
mentality
I even like everyone talks about triple
A's I think just there's a mental block
in thinking about Nintendo as a triple-a
gaming company
XCOM your ex come see your ex come twos
rich well that was that was also two
years ago sure was it yeah was that two
years ago that was the same years doom
this was a it came to the point but what
was your favorite this year and I I was
I was horribly torn Oh between XCOM to
and doom that's right
I might regret this what are you doing
but so you after every time you meet you
know like a little enemy you get to
choose one of three cars and if you want
you can choose none of them and so it's
always a it's always when you're playing
any deck building game you want to make
sure that your hand or that the the
pasta your possible hand you have a lean
deck a deck that's stacked to all the
good stuff and get rid of your crap
stuff so it's like well this card was
good and it does some damage and it
applies poison and right now I'm doing a
pretty good poison heavy so yeah but do
I need it like do I need this card not
really and in if just having it in my
deck is going to disadvantage me in any
way should I have it can you not take a
card yeah you cannot take card if you
think that's wise I took it
Oh
it'll be fine everybody
not a riched half of the bag you
mentioned there's not much Star Wars can
do as far as story goes and isn't he
learn anything from the dark forces
slash Kyle Katarn games or is there
nothing there either there's there's
nothing there either I mean those are
fine games defined games I don't I don't
know there's cinema quality stories that
will resonate through history
which ones were those games uh those
ones you run around and shoot things in
the Star Wars games the Star Wars
first-person shooter games though the
later ones were more third-person where
you would run around with a lightsaber
and what were they called first one okay
this raises a fucked up naming history
okay alright I'm with you the first one
is just called dark forces just dark
forest just dark forces okay the second
one is called
dark forces 2 : Jedi Knight and the
third one is technically speaking dark
forces 3 Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast
my name is so nice see the game the game
Jedi Knight was popular because it had
the word Jedi in it ha ha so they called
the third one Jedi Knight 2 even though
it's the third game in the series yes
much like much like half-life 2 episode
3 yeah that's great what a clusterfuck
much longer are we going to be streaming
I know
Oh what so I would have a lot what's our
up time looking up time we started two
and a half hours ago at least another
hour and a half you know what time what
time is it for another hour and a half
is probably okay probably then it'll be
right around dinnertime for me yeah
right another hour and a half
the valve ever officially say we're
never making another half-life half-life
3 will never be Episode three will never
be that ever beneficial no they've never
made that official I know there there
was a oh that coming did you hear about
the rumors of Microsoft buying valve no
there was rumors that Microsoft was
about to make a big game studio purchase
and like they're gonna buy valve it's
all over huh it's all over oh no I want
to say Gabe or someone just came outside
nope nope nope nope nope no they said
nope nope nope when you hear that it's
over what gaming oh yeah gaming is over
oh no just the fact that Microsoft is
interested in buying steam means that
eventually it's gonna happen here's my
question yeah for the mostly for the
chat not for you because you probably
don't know also that's fair here's my
questions okay
is there some kind of third-party steam
emulator where the games I already have
downloaded from Steam so a third-party
software I can use to launch those games
as if it were steam because when
Microsoft does by valve and Institute's
microtransactions into using games you
already bought I don't want any part of
that shit but I still want access to all
of the games I already own and steam is
DRM
there are non-steam hacks and of course
look at that nope nope yep nope dammit
you suggested pirating rich I've always
had a great attitude towards piracy and
my Steam games that I only gali I would
have zero fucking guilt cracking those
zero guilt and it might be a necessity
someday think valve said they would lose
the DRM if they ever went under we're
not talking about them going under we're
talking about them being bought by
Microsoft or worse maybe EA someday it's
very possible very possible like you
know all those guys didn't they came
from Microsoft like they were part of
the early Windows development team
that's how they got all their money in
the first place
I highly doubt valve would ever sell
Steve he's Gabe Newell he's never gonna
die he's never ever gonna go away he's
an old fat man
it's literally any day any day and they
they were part of the early Windows
development team that's where they got
their money yeah they came from
Microsoft they probably have many
friends there and so you have those
people at Microsoft going we will will
buy steam but we will take care of it as
if you will do it well but you know then
you don't even have to worry about it go
into whatever you want we'll take care
of it but we promise and then a couple
years later we have a new service for
you and it's gonna be a great thing it's
gonna for cloud storage of lava but it
just costs five dollars a year so it's
nothing it's just that the first years
Oh sighs well you know the costs have
gone up that's a little bit more for
everything but it oh it's gonna be fine
it's gonna be fine this is the future
we're telling you the future you know
that right
this is the future this isn't
speculation this is the future this is
definitely happening
this is absolutely happening
DLC first came to be a thing and people
it's a great idea we're just gonna good
stuff you wouldn't about before now here
we are with fucking loot crate's yeah
yeah there's probably a direct line from
DLC to loot crate if the corporation can
fuck you over they will it's what they
do it's what they do and this is why I
buy up my games whatever I can off of
gog.com cuz I I have full control over
that fucking executable I don't need
some fucking server permission to play
my game right
yeah juju is great for that I still like
to use their you know they have GOG
galaxy there's steam like interface
I still like using that so someone post
a picture wasted life somewhere and say
game game development in the 1990s and
it was like a a picture of people from
in software just normal clothes lounge
about goofing off ya never know you know
yeah that was the thing back of the day
and I was that was game development in
the 90s the modern game development was
like a picture of just sending a
corporate board meeting where somebody
was pointing at a float shirt
but that's that's something for the big
guys oh yeah it's it's easier at you you
watching this right now could make a
game the tools are out there for
everyone to make their own game these
are just the big ones we're talking
about you do know that there's steam
games they're DRM free right what like
four of them they're a good for though
we're really good for
steam is too lucrative the South I'm
sure many companies have been trying to
acquire it for a while you know you know
what else is too lucrative the sole of
Fox Studios a lot of you know a lot of
big properties from Fox it's too big so
that by the way when when you become too
big to sell is exactly when you sell
because that's literally the most that
your company is going to be worth ever
that's when you make so much money you
just go off and do whatever you want I'm
there there is a list of things that are
too profitable to sell that have been
sold several times now chemicals is
going to be sold soon are you really
comparing valve to Dow Chemicals are you
really making that comparison haters
gonna hate
you know we're talking to right now Jack
what are we talking a lot of people who
are trying to throw a their head in the
sand
well talking to a lot of ostriches right
now and you know here here you know the
the question that here's the question
because you know when you come up
against a situation like this Ridge it's
always just a what can I do
situation a lot of people they feel
helpless and so rather than feel
helpless they stick their head in the
sand but I get that you because you like
that's what you want to say you want to
say like what can I do to stop this and
what you can do is not shop on steam
like you can show them that profit is in
drm-free you know shopping you shop at
GOG that would just that would just
hasten their being bought by somebody
else
oh well no I mean at the end of the day
steam might be gone right but you're
being proactive in your buying choices
but what I really need some kind of just
steam crack that that will guarantee all
of the games I've purchased will remain
under my control then when when when
when the inevitable happens someday that
would be the the other thing you can do
it we can we can find some sort of legal
loophole to keep all the games we
purchased even though I'm sure somewhere
in in the steam terms of service when
you agree to you sure somewhere in there
it says if we want we're going to take
your game away no matter what absolutely
without a doubt it says that somewhere
but-but-but
they said they would enable users to to
use their games if they went offline and
you believe that why Steve Oh for right
now sure yeah if you go offline use your
games
the questions may 20 mile we'll release
them all if we go under Oh why would you
believe that that means jack-shit that's
an empty promise well let him promise it
they might want that the next owner
won't give a fuck because it says we can
take your games away you agreed to the
Terms of Service motherfucker the
service has become a paid service now Oh
boom we've Church we've changed the
terms of the deal I'm sorry right what's
the Darth Vader line I'm sorry the deal
has been altered or no by the way pray
we don't alter it further and by the way
here's the fucked up thing if if the new
owner decides to take away all your
games the deal won't have been altered
at all
that's the deal it is right now they're
just not charging you anything for it
the terms of service are already there
rich needs therapy he needs to stop
focusing on the future and worry about
the now steam is fine oh yeah yeah don't
don't anticipate problems and plan ahead
that would be foolish
now I get where you're coming from and
you know got you know me I'm usually
like the positive person in this
scenario and rich you are you Yuki
you're negative you're a negative person
you're pessimist you're a pessimistic
person it served me well
but it's that doesn't mean we can't just
assume that everyone is gonna be super
nice and gray we got we got super lucky
with Gabe yeah you guys don't understand
what what a treat
that was not everyone's gonna be that
we just got lucky
you guys are 100% right but out of
curiosity - you go back and play much
older games file access to access to my
Steam probably wouldn't change my gaming
habits much all the time I've been
replaying for the Dead Rising series
lately and series is 12 years old the
first one right just been do you've just
been doing that on stream playing a
little bit of Arkham origins the other
night oh oh yah I was playing last night
fuckin shadow of Rome Oh which is matter
of 15 years old I play old games all the
fucking time yeah and it doesn't you've
paid for them you should be able to play
them oh I found out I found out
something really interesting really
bring it there shadow of Rome yes I was
replaying I literally last night found
out a shadow of Rome they it didn't sell
very well okay they'd already started
work on the sequel okay so you know what
happened shadow of Rome - I heard
mutated into Dead Rising what how is
that how is that a thing this is the
thing well I get it that the thing but
how it like but how I noticed you go to
like the the the storm that's got old
antiques like a lot of the weapons and
armament they have some of that's like
directly from shadow of Rome like the
helmets and whatnot yeah
you're probably most of my gaming is
older games at this point then you paid
for me yeah what it what if you feel
like it
it's good
it looks like I'm dead I might be able
to eat this out I might be able to eat
this out and as soon as you defeat the
boss you get all your health back so I
have 13 right now no I can make it I can
make it I can make it shadow of Rome is
not a PC game well for one I was playing
it on my playstation 2 emulator so very
much was playing it on my PC I own the
fucking disk it's not a problem
a secondly that wasn't the question the
question was how often do you play older
games right and I thought about it most
of my gaming is older games up to an
including shadow was Rome
and be cool about fire safety since you
could have a triple-a studio make a game
for you with an unlimited budget what
would you make them do you can give both
serious and dumb answer I love you guys
keep up the good stuff and I don't think
about it I have to think about it
I want i won whoever said I was dead I
did it i won
fuck y'all boom great great
which don't worry about the future we
won't be able to afford graphics cards
anyway have you witnessed how much the
value has skyrocketed damn
cryptocurrency miners well you know wait
for cryptocurrency to fail them it's
failing then then prices will go back
down we'll be fine
it is like it is crazy dropping yeah
yeah oh man everyone's everyone's in
freefall panic it's crazy how an
unregulated currency system goes into
freefall there's a wonderful article out
there that that speculates that the
immense rise in the price of
cryptocurrency was caused by one person
manipulating the market yeah yeah
one person manipulating the market then
it started to bubble and then of course
you know news agency started talking
about it so then it started bubble more
more and more and then that one person
so there you had a whole bunch of money
and everyone's in freefall now the
government's bad but regulation is bad
oh that's great
see what we can do here three curses
three relics that did not work well for
me last time I don't like that whenever
your enemy dies transfer any poison it
has to there we go
nice that'll do me well that'll do me
well boom
oh I was doing I was doing a little uh I
don't know if you watch any Linus tech
tips for them but no you know he does a
lot of like PC building and hardware
review stuff a lot of text I like his
general lot he's recently put out a
series kind of doing the bare-bones
explanation of like crypto currency and
like you know mining and how it comes
about like how people earn money yeah
and I thought it was but it has been
very informative like figuring out
because it's deregulated if if you have
if you want to get into cryptocurrency
you use a piece of software and that
software becomes part of the network
keeping track of everyone's money yeah
and if you do part of the work to keep
track of everyone's money that's how you
earn new bitcoins I mean part of the
system but people are using high-end
graphic cards and other things to do
more of the work yeah to mine more of
the Bitcoin which is why we're singing
an immense rise in GPUs recently yeah
it's been neat need to learn it's neat
to learn I think I'm good with my
graphics card for a while oh yeah yeah
luckily we got ours before before the
great scare the great scare of odd a
teen I got some money
these bosses are nice so we can do money
question little boss fire then another
boss that's right
great I think I have a I have a ten
sixty and my ten sixty is pretty good
it handles anything I throw at it yeah
is there an end to this game there is
there is there's there's only currently
there's only three worlds and I'm on a
world - yeah and if you can uh I think
there's only three worlds and if you can
beat you know the third mega boss then I
believe you win right now you know it's
the end right now
I think so many of the track chant is
trying to troll us okay great I think so
I'm not sure that's perfect I love it
what time did the back to the Packers
play I mean the joke is that they're
trying to rub it in her face
that the Packers aren't in the Super
Bowl when I don't think you give a shit
and I actively hate the Green Bay
Packers right you're not from yeah yeah
and I could care less about any
organized sport let alone okay yeah okay
I think you're right that was like a ha
ha your Packers aren't in it but we
don't yeah by the way like it is it's a
relief to me as soon as the Packers are
out of the playoff you don't have to
deal with you know like I'm the kind of
person I like watching the nightly news
like oh you know I want to know I want
to know what the weather's gonna be like
tomorrow I want to know if anything
interesting is happening around town but
when the Packers are in the playoff 20
minutes out of the 22 minute news is
Packer coverage yeah it is infuriating
it is it is exhausting so I love it as
soon as they're out of the playoffs if
they even make it to the playoffs it's
it's a relief to me yeah all right all
right all right all right all right all
right all right all right up fuck your
player do you make you make a lot of
extra money for going to the playoffs
I believe that well not only do you make
extra money but if if you are a free
agent or if you know it raises your
value as a player okay if you if you
have a Super Bowl ring absolutely and I
assume the more games you play the more
money you make alright I'm just just I
don't I'm curious I don't know if I were
a player I might root to miss the
playoffs get an extra fuck a month off
heal from all of my fucking protests
football injuries you know you spend an
entire month with your head on ice you
deal with your multiple concussions yeah
right spend some time with your family
before you become a vegetable yeah yeah
that could be nice
no I you know I it's a yeah I think
going to the Superbowl is a young man's
game like if you're fresh in the league
mm-hmm you go to the Superbowl you make
a big play that could mean some more
endorsement deals and big money there
that could mean your your value as a
player goes up well if you're a fair
old-timer you too if you haven't gone I
suppose that was that was the Walter
Payton story okay yeah I don't know you
probably know nothing about this I know
any 85 Bears went to the Super Bowl
right okay um the Super Bowl shuffle
Walter Payton was their star running
super ball shop he was their star
running back only he was he was long in
the tooth of that point he'd been he'd
been on the team for quite some time
okay and this this is his chance to go
to the fucking Super Bowl right and
there was there was one play in the 85
Super Bowl where the Bears were they had
like they were like right on the goal
line
okay and instead of giving the ball to
Walter Payton so he could score a
touchdown in the Super Bowl as a joke as
a fucking joke they gave the ball to the
refrigerator William Perry to have the
big fat guy score the touchdown as a
joke yeah Walter Payton I heard was like
hurt horribly that he never got us he
never got his touchdown and the Super
Bowl and that be the situation where
you'd give it to the running back
because yeah if you're on the line it's
basically just we all smash into each
other and we're gonna make it yeah yeah
yeah yeah that was it was basically Mike
Ditka giving the finger to someone in
Vegas because they had like odds on
Peyton scoring a touchdown yeah nothing
let's fuck with them you know I kind of
like that I no offense to Walter Walter
Walter Walter Perry well what happens to
wait wait wait wait William the
refrigerator Perry and Walter Payton was
running back okay but the fat guy was
the fridge but it's like if I was my
fisca I might make that same call to
fuck with all the kids you know
I actually I probably give it to Walter
just because like you know you've been
working with this man for how long kids
motherfucker a touch yeah
why Ditka said he regretted it after the
fact is he didn't know how much it meant
oh sure sure to Walter Payton yeah sorry
sorry fridge was very popular that's
true
oh sure he was he was the star of the
Super Bowl shuffle that's what I know
about the refrigerator gosh dang it yes
yes refrigerator he did get a GI Joe
named after him oh yeah yeah Walter
Payton did not get a chance you named
after me how embarrassing I I do suppose
they're like that the the moral of the
story here is if there is something
that's very important to you make sure
the people around you know what that is
you know like we want we all want to be
modest we none of us like asking for
things but if it's something that's very
important you put might you take Mike
discus I think if we get into this
situation I would sure like to score a
touchdown yeah and then yeah then he
would have that innocent
madam says hey rich and Jack nice I'm
family friends with the elephant trainer
/ actor who played one of the sand
people from a new home
do you guys have any questions for him I
can report back next stream no no I
can't even verify them this is accurate
but thanks yeah I'm good
so the decision-making there I was
taking my time yeah these these are
thieves mother
these are muggers and he's about to hit
me for sixteen damage and so I had to
choose whether I was going to attack him
or raise up my shields yeah they have a
tendency to run away and if they run
away like every time they attack you
they take a little bit of your money and
if they run away obviously they take all
your money with them
and so I've decided to take a bit more
of a hit to make sure I get some more
damage on them because I don't want this
guy to run away okay just in case
someone is yelling at me for my for my
lack of strategy your strats yeah but
it's okay he's gonna die for sure now
he's got another he's got nothing yep
he's dead great I probably even could
have done you know erred on the side of
shielding but I wanted to make sure I
got all my money's back are you worried
about them judging your performance in
this game well you know how the chat is
no matter what move I make they're gonna
say eight moves ago you made the wrong
move and that's what led to your
destruction you're damned if you do
damned if you don't
of course correct but also I just saw I
just want to explain myself anonymous
says hey guys I'm really close my really
close friend was one of Jesus's apostles
have any questions you want me to ask
him I don't mind at all okay so I do
have a question for Jesus when you are
putting together a bench just as a
possible oh she's one of his impossible
stack I thought he could ask a question
to Jesus well you know you think the
impossible gonna ask Jesus I guess that
could work well cuz I have a question
about a bench I'm trying to make a bench
and I want to make it sturdy enough yeah
and so like the question is how how much
do I have to worry about cross bracing
the legs with the but I think Jesus is
gonna say that the cross is very
important
that's great
that's great you took my carpentry joke
you added another level to it and it was
great that was great teamwork there
that took way too much health I like
that one
like that one we're gonna take that one
we're gonna get rid of I don't have any
curses we're gonna get rid of one of our
weaker cards
this could be a good one to get to I
could help that could help kind of
fucked I lost a lot in that battle I
lost a lot of help from that battle area
but it's very sorry
it's all
oh really
scaling the city you notice a wall
covered in the writing of ancients as
you try to wrap your head around the
puzzling symbols and glyphs or around
what the puzzling symbols and glyphs
could mean the writing begins to glow
suddenly the message becomes clear so I
can either remove a card from my deck
or take all of my weak cards and upgrade
them all one card verses a whole bunch
well but removing a weak card from my
deck so I am more likely to get my
strong card sure or take all my weak
cards and make them slightly more strong
that's private I would go with that
that's probably smart choice yeah yeah
so now all all of my defends are eight
blocks and all my attacks are nine
damage so that's pretty nice yeah that's
pretty nice I'll take them
the latter makes more statistical sense
I'm inclined to agree
asked Jesus as Jesus Jesus wasn't really
great with strategy
wasn't he we're strategy mm-hmm uh you
know I guess he knew that he knew the
long game but that wasn't him making the
plans
well isn't that a really old debate
whether or not Jesus and God are the
same and you get ready you know that's
the Trinity man they're the same but
different that's a big talking point
this is the same but different and the
Holy Spirit's there too he doesn't get
to love
so down Rome yeah in the long run yeah
who's the long game a lot of people have
died over this ridiculous question
why does the New Testament getting a
soft reboot not too long ago they called
it Mormonism I got the same back story
but they added a whole bunch of new
characters Joseph Smith guy whatever
what a very soon very soon we can do
today everyone thanks for the stream
just fantastic he probably did Mary Sue
yes and Jane and Beth and Margaret and
and her and her sister Deborah and her
sister I think her name was Debra yeah
yeah yep yeah yeah all right great this
that my character is especially suited
to defeat this movie this guy right here
I'm just going to kind of defend up add
some more poison and we are good to go
boom I've defeated him already he's not
gonna do shit to me I can just add my
turn and win so I think I'm gonna do
that
ie a BEC joke that's true
I think you know you can look at Beck's
two albums after odelay and I don't
think they get the the praise you know
obviously coming off of Oda lake mm-hmm
right after odelay he made like just a
straight-up slow folk album yeah and you
know delay was this crazy alternative
hip hop slacker yeah Rock thing and then
like he goes makes just a low-key folk
out and feel like what the fuck and then
he comes back with midnight vultures
which is the is apotheosis the peak yeah
it's it's late now the epitome it's the
epitome of white boy soul it's just it's
a it's a straight-up funk album about
about like you know sex and love and
crazy stuff all through Beck's eyes and
he's possibly the whitest person ever to
live you know born and raised in
California with actor parents yeah and I
just don't think midnight vultures gets
the love it deserves okay I've kind of
read listen to that he has a song called
Deborah and it's all about seducing
seducing a girl who works at the
JCPenney in order to have a three-way
with her and her sister I think her name
is Deborah okay it's a great song
apophysis is the high point okay
I thought it was the epitome I think
there may be a slowly boat they don't
know both the high point okay epitome
apotheosis Beck is a hack you are wrong
Beck he's not a hack just for loser
alone right just for that one song he's
not a hack
Oh like mellow gold is a great album to
like it Beck just tells it how it is
yeah he is not made well he now he's
made a bad album he said he's made a
couple bad songs but he is amazing I
think you're a crazy person
Beck is amazing none of us is rich
please play shadow of Rome on the stream
I'm an ancient history teacher and would
love to giggle at all the terrible
historical inaccuracies of that August
Ian's propaganda I have played that on
stream it was a while ago now have you
know yeah and I don't care if it's an
Agora it's a fun game it's a fun game no
they get rid of any inaccuracy problems
if they just made it like space
gladiators oh space Rome yeah yeah it's
it's Rome but on the planet Zboard right
right yeah Beck is occultist I know
that's the only downside to Beck he's a
Scientologist but he seems cool about it
just seems like a nice dude
none of us says hey rich and Jack I I'm
a family friend of myself oh great the
twitch watcher slash friend of the Star
Wars elephant trainer do you have any
questions about asking stupid questions
on the Internet
that guy gets it
Shadow Realm I would love more shadow
Rome okay but no in hindsight as much as
I love Dead Rising I think I got the
better end of that deal okay we shadow
Rome yeah
or wait we're with Dead Rising what Dead
Rising you would rather have dead right
rather have dead rising than shadow of
Rome - I'll get you all set dungeon but
I love me some shadow of Rome
if I asked nicely will they answer
anyway ah good upon how well either how
dumb I think your question is or if I
have any interesting response to it
hmm like I see a lot of have you played
X have you seen X and I haven't and I
could answer the question and just say
no I haven't played X and that's that's
very boring for everybody mm-hmm
a lot of times I deliberately skip
questions that I see even if I see that
question 30 times right and it's it's
sometimes we do we skip because it's
boring right what's your favorite
high-top shoes what yeah yeah what
what's your favorite what's your
favorite Nirvana album unplugged
maybe not the answer you want but it's
my favorite
yes
Thanks
great
great it's an interesting answer do you
prefer music that's less produced and
more Rod generally no generally I prefer
music that's really produced
I think unplugged is just an exception
to that role usually that usually I
think live performances are just blah
usually usually usually they're just
like less optimal than me all right
right like the album version they've
taken time they've crafted right right
but unplug it sounds different than
because it's cuz it's unplugged
right and that that makes it interesting
yeah I'm with you yeah with you
unplugged cat like it's I think it's
really hard to capture the energy of a
live performance I love going to shows I
love seeing live shows but it's hard to
capture that feeling and I'll go ahead
and agree that unplugged does that even
though I'm not a huge Nirvana fan
unplug sounds different well it's it's
not electric its acoustic yeah they know
what they're doing I think if they also
had just had really good mixers and
producers for unplugged that was a whole
that was a whole special thing
not produced doesn't mean unplugged what
the fuck are you talking about
well unplugged was kind of both it was a
live performance I wasn't really they
they painstakingly took sections here
and there and piece something together
in a in a soundproof room where they get
the perfect audio Bush right
I do think though there is a level of
production to the unplugged session you
know like they they spent time and just
worked on these sure the acoustics and
the performance of those songs Nirvana
you know nailed it and on that but you
know like if you're talking about like
you know a like a band like a band like
modest mouse
I think weighs like a fair example if
you listen to their earlier albums and
their later albums their earlier albums
they didn't have necessarily the money
to produce the songs like like hey these
are ideas we got to get them out fast
because we only have so much time in the
studio so it's less produced and their
later albums are more producing a lot of
fans of modest mouse or bands like that
say that the songs suffer because of
more production like I can't even
imagine listening to like a live
performance of Bohemian Rhapsody I can't
even I don't even want pictures no no
that's the definition of produced like
if you went to the show it would be
great but yeah you don't want to listen
to them I'm with you
which do you like green day yeah I like
green day
I generally can stand the live versions
of songs absolutely actually that was
one of the reasons that I stopped
listening to Pandora you ever listen to
Pinto let me find it we find that whole
gamut you stop scrolling I gotta find
that comment I keep going keep going oh
well here is the ghost of Nexus which is
a pretty smart guy he's got more brains
than sealing in Kurt's
garage that's that's my kind of humor
well what do ya'll scuba-dive I wanna
see rich in a wet suit so this is the
kind of thing I just ignored right well
I guess I wanted to point it out to
people who might not understand the kind
of things we do ignore you see do you
see why we ignore it no you dig
how you doing jack is this gonna be the
run I'm feeling pretty confident this
guy's about to fuck my day not too hard
but he's this is uh this is the book of
stabbing as you see it's a ghost hand
with the big knife that comes out of the
book which is adorable so he's about to
hit me four four four damage three times
so and I only have a four shield and I
have a pretty good poison on him
you basically just gonna he's gonna fuck
my day but not terrible I'm not terribly
fucked so Chad if I don't read a tip I
probably have a reason for not reading
that tip mm-hmm so for that reason there
would not be a transcript that I would
release of the unread tips do you
understand how that works and I think
I've read everything today so come on
get it to get it storm Templar says Jack
I'm Jack how much do I have to tip for
you to try out my favorite band poets of
the fall they are a rock group from
Finland and one of the best songs is war
slurp my chirp
I mean if you want me to if you want
like guarantee I will listen to it did
he tip that yeah how step o2a1 huh - a1
- what was it called favorite band poets
of the fall it's called war yeah I'm
gonna go away from the microphone so I
don't get copyright strike listen to it
no copyright here I'll just turn this
away that away now you hear me twice
don't like it I already did
do I sound normal or is there like a
weird it's probably not a weird echo
weird double I'm just twice as loud is
that how that works I don't think that
would be how that works I'm in stereo
finished Nickelback its it seems to be
growing on him but isn't like you know
with guitars fickle backer finn'll back
yeah yeah might as well be saying
yeah that's kind of lame not my thing
God poets of the fall I was listening to
that oh sorry
the that was poets of the fall and I was
listening to the song war not
necessarily my jam that was very it was
what I what I would refer to as schlock
rock okay
I have also one which is great I got I
got I have some really good poison cards
and so like if you see down here all of
his health bar is filled with poison cuz
it's green and so as soon as my turn is
done he's gonna take that much in poison
damage like I could you know I'll just
kill him with my swords even though he's
poison just to fuck him just to say fuck
yeah but then he's still attacking you
while he's dying of the poison though no
no cuz poison damage gets taken first
and then he attacks I would have one
snake Oh skull whenever you apply poison
apply an additional poison and I have
amazing poison cards that just super
helped me that just super helped me so
what you're saying is you're killing it
what does the XP is it random X is how
many energies you have left so if I
played this first it would everyone
would lose three strengths and apply
three weak okay or if I lose it when I
just had one point left you know yeah
this could be very powerful and when if
you upgrade this card it does it then it
does X plus one which is even better but
that my hand is so rocking right now I I
don't want to add anything unless I'm
really gonna add something amazing like
this is an upgraded version of a card I
already have adding six block and
another six block next turn which could
be helpful but I already have the
the other version of that yeah and I
don't know what I'm gonna get to a fire
or a shop next to remove anything so I'm
just gonna skip it I I'm pretty happy Oh
fires next knit that would have been
worth taking or see look so it's fire
boss thing fire so if I wanted to gamble
at this fire I could upgrade that one
card I have to the good version okay see
if I can make it through the boss battle
and then rest and you know gain health
of this fire yeah
or I could do the apps of rest and gain
health here do the boss battle okay okay
there so I actually I think I'm gonna do
that I'm gonna play it smart play it a
little cautiously we're gonna rest here
so now I'm at sixty four out of 70
health which is you know it's probably
the smart move yeah take on the elite
here then get a treasure then upgrade
cards can you upgrade your energy can it
ever be more than three of three there
there are certain relics these things up
here that give you more energy they
usually come at some sort of balancing
cost though okay so like there's one
that actually lets you have four energy
that you spend but you no longer gain
gold yeah so then you just you know
can't you shops which you know not
necessarily the worst thing but yeah
there are ways to Vox do-rag this is
rich what are your favorite flavors of
Jones Soto remember that episode of
Voyager when they went back it's a earth
and met Sarah Silverman and Tuvok Ed's
aware a do-rag
to cover up his Vulcan here yeah
it's fine it's fine
Vox drag you crazy kids well the only
time I've had Joan Soto's and somebody
sent to someone's birthday cake and
mango I think was it mango whatever the
other one was I didn't care for her much
but the birthday cake was surprisingly
good for a birthday cake flavored
something sure Jack do you and the rest
of the guys like hard cider I'm
definitely not planning on sending you
some the answer
no I I've never once witnessed Mike or
Jay drinking a hard cider cup and myself
like my brother really likes him
and so every once in a while if I'm
hanging out at his house like I'll have
one and you like you know you have one
and it's just so sweet oh no it's not I
mean it's alcoholic I presume the
carbonated juice and it's just so sweet
that if you have more than one you get
you get a bellyache
so mmm for anyone who hasn't watched two
Star Trek Voyager what Jax is describing
actually happened yes Voyager went back
in time to the 90s to earth yeah met
Sarah Silverman and in order to blend in
Tuvok had to wear a do-rag it was great
it was fucking great
what would you recommend watching first
to someone who wants to get into Star
Trek TNG season 3 was my go-to and I
mean I've talked about this before
generally I I like starting at the
beginning but I I can see you're arguing
that once he hits season 3 of the next
generation it gets significantly better
C T and G is very episodic you don't
have to worry about missing out on some
kind of story art what's wrong story arc
from seasons due to carryover don't
worry there's nothing like that yeah
so my suggestion is usually start with
season three and then if you're liking
season three then you can go back and
check out some of the earlier seasons I
think well there's someone in the chat
is going to violently disagree with me I
think season ones kind of generally
awful good one season two has either
really bad episodes of really good
episode season two's sure yeah I
understand you're arguing and I can
agree within a certain point where
season 3 is universally good yes then
you can go back to 1 & 2 and you you'll
already have a fuzzy feeling about your
you're playing the safe bet I get that
you might have a little bit of whiplash
because I think actually season 1 season
2 and season 3 don't they have a
different uniform every season mile when
is the big uniform change season 1 the
two I think is that it I think when when
when Captain Picard has to then adjust
his jacket every time he stands up oh
yeah but there's there's like skin-tight
in season 1 it looks so bad it's really
weird I get it I get it I get it
dr. Crusher's replacement was dr.
Pulaski and she was a better character
than dr. crusher yes boring
I'm not I'm not a doctor crusher hater
like riches but hey I'm a hater but
polite or I can say Pulaski was an
infinitely better character okay
absolutely
Pulaski had a thing she had a stick
who's hot I don't I'm mad I'm joking
right now I'm not saying that's the
argument against Pulaski in favor of
crusher that's my joke argument you
think that that's someone else's
argument sure but she didn't like data I
know it was a character thing that they
could do episodes about her getting
along with data and learning things
about each other yeah I know that was
her thing she she liked data and she
also didn't like teleporters right yeah
yeah she had a thing Pulaski is just a
female clone of McCoy and Riker is just
a clone of Kirk the name is switch the
genders Riker Riker was the backup
captain if if if this funky old man
balding diplomat doesn't work out no
we've we've got a Kirk in our back
pocket we can promote after Picard is
killed off yeah yeah Picard was the
safety I mean I'm a Riker was the safety
yeah yeah Oh agreed yeah especially that
that first season Riker is fucking all
the aliens he like he's more Kirk than
than uh what's his no he's more Curtain
chris pine than chris pine absolutely
he's crazy season one he's great
Rikard defeated the park he's not a
terrible character I'm just saying I
think he was there as a backup in case
card didn't work out as a character they
had they had the safe captain that was
like the captain you knew before to go
to know I think that's absolutely true
that's absolutely true and that's that's
not saying William Riker was a bad
character it's not the same thing
don't remember Kirk sitting like he'd
never seen it sure before when there's a
story behind that didn't didn't uh
Jonathan Frakes have like a bad back
and that's why he's sat weird well I
know he got into the chair weird
remember like I think he did that
because it was some kind of issue with
his back I think they didn't made a
medical issue really and that was just
the way he said to compensate for it
yeah does that happen throughout the
series yeah it's just a season one thing
we really think it's throughout the
series he kind of like he kind of like
kicks over the chair to sit on it he's
standing behind the chair yeah and he
sits down by lifting up his leg over the
back of the chair or the high part of
the chair right and that's how he sits
down and then sits on it
I wonder if that was a back thing or if
that was just a bad costume thing that
he turned into a character thing well I
presume if he tries to sit normally just
goes that's my presumption and that
would have been yeah to edit out of
every single scene when he sat the
rhykker maneuver absolutely right your
maneuver man
and for some reason you haven't noticed
that go back and look at how Ryker sits
down every fuckin time it's great
no oh they have a compilation videos you
just look up the Ryker maneuver on
YouTube and you'll see the compilation
videos it's great
it's fucking great man
I was five seasons into TNG and didn't
notice until someone pointed it out to
me but oh so that's by the way Jonathan
Frakes we can all you know make fun of
his directing ability that is fine but
like I think he he pulled it off like as
an actor is what I'm gonna say yeah as
an actor he made it work he made it seem
so natural it felt like something Riker
wouldn't it's like oh this a weird thing
Riker does and it just didn't even
register to so many people because of
Frank's good old flakes
felt like some weird macho bullshit
thing that's probably how he sold it but
that was Rikers
like right even in the even in the like
hyper liberal diplomatic world of TNG
like Riker was the masculine version of
of hyper liberal diplomatic Riker
respected everyone respected the fuck
out of him if you know what I'm saying
he got around
pretty sure Frakes directed the episode
The Offspring which is one of my
favorite TNG episodes Jonathan Frakes
directs a ton of things
oh my question my questioning his
directorial talent was when someone
suggested that he directs was it what
was he like people were started trying
to get an online petition for him to
direct like a major motion picture like
a big one and I forget what it was
probably one of the star tracks could be
a Star Trek or Star Wars first contact
and insurrection right did he direct
those yes I know for sure he did
insurrection I'm pretty sure he did
first contact well then there you go
yeah
I don't think he can handle the movies I
think he does a lot of TV directing well
you say that but first contact is one of
the most popular Star Trek movies I
don't get it
but yeah so there you go there you go
well I hope you know what I've always
wondered what have you always been asked
Jonathan Frakes anything I'd ask this
stupid question okay it's a stupid
question though do you remember the end
of Star Trek insurrection when they're
fighting on the ship that collectorship
yeah suck up the the youth that Mysteria
remember what the interior looked like
it was like scaffolding right because I
remember them the walls writing
specifically were those glowing blue
walls I have always wondered okay if
that wasn't a Blake that was originally
supposed to be a blue screen it was
gonna be windows out into space but it
didn't work because how much fucking fog
they had in the room I always wondered
it that was a failed blue screen effect
and if I can ask Jonathan Frank one
stupid question that was being was that
was that originally meant to be a blue
screen effect and it just didn't work so
it's I got space it's a globe blew in
from below by the way it's a panel
that's a really great question yeah
so someone clipped that question tweet
it to Frakes put us in the ATS and we'll
see if we can get this edge Jonathan mr.
Frakes Jon do you prefer John to
Jonathan we have a question about
the blue-screen of Star Trek
insurrection anybody maybe blue screen
any questions about purple space
bazookas no clip it tweet it go
just watch the Riker compilations he has
great posture because he had a bad back
oh you learn real good posture if your
back hurts all the time man you take
care of that shit I'm pretty sure that
was mentioned in the blanket review no
that was probably my question when I was
review it's probably from me sure yeah
and you know like I've seen him I don't
you guys remember the shit that we make
way better than we do I'm sure I was
watching that with Mike before he made
the instruction review and I probably
pointed that out by the way that's a
fair question with modern blue and
green-screen technology if any if any
time you see a flat blue thing or a flat
green thing you just wonder it was some
supposed to go there
nice people are mentioning the
commentary track for insurrection does
he does he mention something about this
or is your point that they don't mention
anything about it because I can see if
it was a blue screen effect that film
you might be reluctant to say yeah this
is a big mistake in the movie because
you're these are these are failed blue
screen panels you might you might be
reluctant to say that so unless he said
that's definitely what it was it's not
conclusive right right right
people always bitch about Wesley but I
never hear a peep about Alexander he is
so terrible I never ever rewatch any
episode where he's in it even briefly
thoughts for those who don't know yeah
obviously I I could only assume the
majority people here are star trekkers
Alexander is wharfs son he's in like
four episodes of Tianjin right he
doesn't show up off on an offer to get
your panties in a bunch and he's nowhere
near as obnoxious as Wesley was cuz
Wesley was a fucking know-it-all mm-hmm
Alexander was just an annoying kid but
he wasn't a fucking know-it-all annoying
kid right yeah I can Alex Alexander to
me what he was annoying but I think his
intention of trying to you know cuz like
that was wharfs whole thing is like a
Klingon in the human world you know oh
how will I deal with this and then you
know adding a son into that mix and very
much not Klingon well that's the thing
like I liked the messaging of like
integrating into a society while keeping
my own culture intact yeah that was good
messaging even though yes all little
kids are annoying Alexander is no
exception to that
wil Wheaton's feelings will be hurt
looking at nothing against Wil Wheaton
but Wesley was annoying and that it's
not necessarily Wil Wheaton's fault
right
he didn't say write me like a
know-it-all prick what if he did why we
came in to set like you know he's at the
table reading he's like you know what my
character not a big enough dickhead I
really think I should be a raging
asshole and I said okay well you're the
actor won't trust you is a know-it-all
prick I don't know enough about Wil
Wheaton to make that determination I
haven't followed his career after the
fact I'm just saying it's not
necessarily a correlation I also I know
he does a board game show the dude has
dedicated his life to like showing off
board games so I can't fault him I know
nothing about what he does now except
for does he has a book is it like a he
livestreams board games I think so oh
I'm good for him
mama says it's funny that you would
mention Jonathan Frakes Frank's my old
war buddy from the wars is actually
really close with his agent what was the
question you wanted to pass along this
have no idea how much I love running
gasps I love them and I the this is the
the I know this person let me pass along
a question is my favorite running gag of
today thank you so thank you all
update I can't find my insurrection DVD
so D was going to check the commentary
track that's very I'm sorry it's that
I'm very sorry
oh shit
Sene use green screen outside those
walls which were living away
inconsistent with a green screen said
they were just shitty design at least
part of that said ISM at green screen
and where the wall the walls were green
or blue walls were blue
that doesn't necessarily why would you
use two different colors if you're
worried about bleed yeah which is like
you know when you're lighting something
for a green or a blue screen if your
actor is too close to that color they
get you know a green light spill all
over the for anybody who's confused
Tiberius Kirk posted an image of that
set I'm talking about with the blue
walls right and there's a green area
like near the floor like that looks like
it's clearly went to be a green screen
sure it's said like that that's like
showing a fire or something below him so
the other reason why you would use one
green and one blue screen is if you're
worried about any sort of like tracking
data okay so maybe you want to
differentiate the green from the blue
because they're two different things so
you want to key them differently okay
okay it's showing us that there is a
green screen it doesn't help the
argument that they live ran out of
budget okay but it doesn't necessarily
squash well I'm not necessarily saying
budget I remember that scene had on like
tubes and and smoke billowing out of the
- yeah and I know that would probably
make it harder to blue screen something
absolutely yeah
so that's what I'm saying is it doesn't
squash the argument but it doesn't help
it either okay
we're kind of we're kind of in the same
boat
Jack the practical walls aren't lit like
a chroma key ok characters are not close
to the walls the walls are backlit also
they didn't run out of budget they spent
around 10 million in post-production
fixes and that's fair like I don't I
honestly don't remember the scene I'm
just I'm just speculating on
post-production whatnots and whosits
meyer agree there has nothing to do with
the budget I'm just I remember that
scene was just filled with fog sure so
you just think that they got into
post-production and said it's going to
be nearly impossible with all the fog
which yes yeah I mean though a good post
a good post-production place will have
the tools to deal with that yeah it
would take a lot of time and got and
budget okay I still think it's a fair
question was the decision made fuck it
it looks like a space thing at some
point was it supposed to be chroma and
they said fuck it
they shot lots of green screen with that
fog though okay all right
no-no-no
the real van sense the real via I read
once that freak sat down like that as a
joke prayer to protest how small the
chairs on set were and when no one
noticed he just kept doing it I love it
I've heard he had back problems Sean
says will Wheaton and his wife show up
on the yearly Jo Co cruise which is a
Jonathan Coulton
nerdy board game cruise and they are
both super nice in public no okay okay
FAC is your deck getting too big for
another cup oh yeah III don't know
anything about Wil Wheaton so the reason
why I didn't choose another card is
because I'm really liking my deck right
now it works very well together and I
want to make sure that I get good hands
and so the more cards you add even
though they're good cards it means that
you're possibly not going to get the
combination you want the combination I'm
looking for specifically is this
nightmare card which adds a three copies
of one other card in my hand to my next
hand I want that with something like
this one which deals damage and applies
weak to people or with my Shiv card or
with this so I you don't want your deck
to get too cumbersome you're
strategizing I'm strategizing you you
only get you know X amount of cards in
your hand at a time and you want to make
sure that those hands are not only good
cards but they synergize well with each
other and so the more cards you add the
less opportunities for synergy kinetic
erection the chat says a lean decks a
lean deck is sometimes the best read
absolutely absolutely
like and you know the cards here this
one like you know this is one I have
already which is just five damage plus
three poison damage
this one could be good which is next
turn I get more moves that that's
tempting I really want that one because
I often find myself running out of
points this one applies three poison and
three weeks why poison an enemy and to
make that enemy weaker to me and I have
a pretty good poison synergy going but I
just don't need any of them this would
be this is the only one I'd be thinking
about for one energy cost the next turn
I get two extra energies so instead of
spending three I get to spend five
ultimately it's only one extra right
exactly it's not that I don't think it's
that good
hey it could it could be like if that
next turn I get five cards you know that
perfectly line up but the odds are not
with me so that's that's why I'm
choosing not to to do that I'm gonna
play it a little safe here I'm gonna go
the question mark see if I can get any
loot okay true blue review says hey guys
I know a guy that lives in Milwaukee and
he says he's friends with the guys from
red letter media anything you would want
him to ask them I think I think we have
officially run it into the ground
so like I've now mentioned that this is
a running gag I know you have you've
encouraged it now but that was also the
signal that it was it could kind of peak
but now the problem is you know any good
running gag will have its peaks and
valleys and so we're in a valley now
that one brought to the valley a couple
more in the valley it could come back
again but sorry targeted strikes
targeted strikes alright in an abandoned
temple you find a giant book open
riddled with cryptic writing as you try
to interpret the elaborate script it
begins to shift and morph into writing
you are familiar with let's read it
odd the book seems to be about an
ancient named Nia
this piques your interest but you have a
general feeling of malaise ok lose one
HP the ancient of resurrection Miao was
exiled to the bottom of the spire Oh
meow that was meow like a cat yeah yeah
you feel compelled to read more but your
body begins to ache oh shit I don't like
this seeking vengeance now blesses
outsiders using them for his own
purposes you are now starting to feel
very weak and tired fuck those
resurrected by me I'll remember only
fragments of their past selves cursed to
fight for eternity as you near the final
page old wounds begin to open so I can
obtain the book and lose ten or just
lose three I kind of got to go for at
this point upon finishing the time he
decides to take it with you proof in
hand you'll retain your memories what
does it do at the end of each turn you
can choose one of three random cards to
shuffle into your draw pile that could
be good got 26 health and a fires right
there everything's terrible
that's stupid camp goddamnit meow
meow we're fuckin smell state thanks my
name is Tate dammit dammit dammit dammit
dammit we're kind of fucked these guys I
think these guys raised power every
single it's fine it's gonna be fine it's
gonna be fine
damnit what happened I don't I don't I I
only have I can only gain five block oh
I can play week - okay well we can make
it we can make it we can make it you can
make it you go check you go we can make
it
okay now they're only gonna hit me for
six funny thing is in the background
that sounds an awful lot like a plane
crashing it's of highly appropriate so
now they're gonna hit me for 11 still
not great oh if I can kill this guy
which I can't by the way it'll be better
no I can't kill him so nine fourteen
plus three poisoned he already had some
poison no no I can come close
what's the weekend huh well what's the
weekend what do you mean the one in the
middle the caltrops what does that do so
he was gonna attack me for six but now
he's only gonna exactly first oh you
used it i used it already so what I owe
this one is whenever someone attacks me
we deal 5 damage but I also take the
damage yeah but that actually I think I
want to do that
I think I want to do that way I want to
know what just happened
oh alright alright
like I'm gonna survive this which is
nice it's fine it's fine I'm not gonna
die this time
I might survive this battle but now like
every turn they get stronger so now each
of them is plus three so now they each
are attacking me four more fuck fuck
fuck you you take your time you you make
this work I'm gonna make it work so I
can kill this guy rich what makes Wesley
I know it all alright
nobody likes kids who are written as
being smarter than all of the a date
surrounding that that that almost never
works
razorblade had since rich whenever you
laugh at Jack's misfortune in stream it
lights my life my world and gives me the
will to live for at least 14 more days
you got about a good two months out of
the stream we're doing better I have I
have a thing here whenever I whenever an
enemy dies transfer any poison it has to
a random enemy which we already done and
I have another thing which is whenever
an enemy dies gain one point and draw a
card so this this is turning out alright
this turn out alright we I think I'm
gonna be able to do something
might be able to turn this around
nine plus five is 40 okay all right all
right they're not gonna hit me this time
yeah I'm gonna defend what's a deadly
poison all right all right
oh I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it
yeah yeah I'm gonna do it this is the
advantages of having a lean hand I know
that my odds of having a lean deck right
my odds of having a good hand are nice
and high all right they're gonna hit me
for nine so that's 18 and get nine block
I don't want to attack them I need I
need shields at the moment but I also
like you know it's bounce cuz like the
the longer the game goes the more
powerful they get every turn they're
gonna get a little stronger oh I know I
know it's maddening it's me I already
have shit like so people hate him
because he's smart yes that's exactly
why everyone hates Wesley Crusher yes
didn't we talk about this last dream
which is the the the per the person in
your life who goes well actually there's
a difference between being smart and
being a dickhead well actually
nice okay I got it defend we've got
another defendant coming up we're gonna
make it we're gonna make it raise you
you need to kill one of them yes and I
don't know if I can kill one of them but
now I can come close at least some
triple and enemies poison yep and this
guy's pretty deep
oh he's dead that guy's dead yes and now
we can attack this guy and have enough
defense to deal with anything oh yeah
we're fine
go we're golden we're golden Ponyboy
dead and this guy's dead next turn he
won't be able to hit me perfect that's
perfect this is perfect everything's
perfect boom boom one hit point left
he's dead you know let's just let's hit
him with with our weakest attack just to
say fuck you there we go Oh see now this
is a nice guy this isn't easy you know
like just just for shields zero points
yeah you know the problem with this is
this is if thinking of a lean deck this
means that having this card Mahan gives
me four free block points let's look at
the dagger spray though for damage to
all enemies twice that's nice damage
it's a lot of damage
let's deal I guess one enemy then it's
not so exactly you know all of these
could be nice but you know all of them
mean that you're not gonna get that
synergy combo in your hand all right all
right even this one even that's what I'm
wearing now I'm gonna tell you what to
do but I have I'm choosing that one
because I have enough cards that are
like draw more cards okay so that could
just be a nice bonus all right we have
to make it through one more battle
before we can rest
great and almost looks fairly nasty it
doesn't look great yeah it's not great
it's not great novices rich if you
considered playing the original Deus Ex
or System Shock 2 both of them are
absolute fantastic games with relatively
solid stories from video games also
refit Enterprise versus enterprise-d
just just as far as how it looks a refit
Enterprise is the most beautiful ship
and all of science fiction love the
refit Enterprise but a damn long time
since I've played the original Deus Ex
and I haven't I never really started the
System Shock 2 honestly that one went
under my radar when I came out was one
of the ones that's right some day and I
never I never actually did never get
around to so
sure
13 I'm gonna take me for 13 are ya
what are you gonna do this enemy intends
to inflict a powerful negative effect on
me if I were if I were going to own a
model of any any ship yeah
any ship at all it would be the refit
enterprise and where would we see the
reap what's that you know like obviously
original enterprises the series was
refit part of the movies the motion
picture the motion picture motion
picture star trek - Wrath of Khan okay
then a then it got blowed up and three
and then they had the enterprise a which
is basically basically the same ship
okay
mr. glitch says I loves me and the refit
enterprise I remember being deeply
disappointed in the enterprise DS look
it's so damn ugly when I first saw it I
didn't like the look of the enterprise-d
the next-gen enterprise it grew on me
over time yeah but it is not my favorite
ship in the franchise I think that's
fair
yes yes what is what is the ugliest ship
to have the enterprise name it kind of
has to be the NX right which one's the
NX enterprise from enterprise enterprise
absolutely I was I was going to say
Scott Bakula yeah so what yeah you know
absolute apps of fucking Lee if it
weren't for that ship I would be giving
it to the enterprise-e which I can't
stand which ones that that's the one
from the the later next-gen movies it's
got that over the saucer that goes out
straight I hate the way it looks okay
I'm just gonna have to believe it looks
like a stretched-out Voyager okay that's
fair that's fair
the enterprise Enterprise J is the worst
I have no idea what the J is from hey
the sovereign class is great no I mean
that's your opinion I can't refute your
opinion but my opinion is that it looks
like ass
I made it I won the not a clean win the
enterprise B and that was the excelsior
class and I looked like the Excelsior
not a bad design see from that one
episode of of next-gen actually really
like to see it's like a it's like a
hybrid between the refit enterprise and
the enterprise-d okay and it was in one
episode like one episode yeah it was in
one of the best episodes drawn a blank
in the name though where there was an
alternate timeline in tashi are still
alive and everyone was at war with the
Klingons because the enterprise-c got
shot back in time and it didn't do the
thing that it ends up doing war sure
sure
yesterday's enterprise Thank You Chad
yesterday's enterprise a far better
send-off for Tasha Yar then the sludge
monster episode was poor sludge monster
I'm fairly hurting going into the boss
battle here I only have 34 health
and this this ever I'm gonna die just
everyone just know I'm gonna die this is
not gonna end well
that
alright gotta get him poison fast and a
lot
this is the boss with the boss of the
game not of the game of this level this
is I'm only I'm only in world to of of
300 I'll and I'm probably gonna die here
I'll see you guys I think the stream is
about over anyway perfect it's perfect
I'm so boned
yet but I need to use it soon what is
going on okay okay so this boss he has
minions and you know they obviously do
damage and he can summon more of them
and all that fun stuff he's about to hit
me for fourteen he's gonna hit me for
seven two times I have him a little bit
poisoned
so he's poisoned he at three right now
and I have this which triples an enemy's
poison which I can only use this card
once per battle obviously I don't want
to use it yet I want to wait to build up
his poison a little bit and really use
it later and so I only have three to use
right now I have this one which won't
help me at the moment
wait wait wait isn't the nightmare the
card that triples it triples any one
card yes triple your triple poison yeah
but then like I'll triple it I'll triple
it and he'll have nine then I'll triple
it and he'll have you know like I still
don't think it's enough so wait so you
so so he starts with no next turn he
starts with my next turn you get three
of the poisoned things so then nine
times three you could poison him more
next turn before you use all three of
those potentially no but these each cost
one okay
potentially okay I can see your concern
there these each cost one but okay so
but we could get him up like so if I use
if I use nightmare to triple this and
then use this he's at nine the next turn
he's at twenty one times three is sixty
three times three is a hundred that
sounds like a lot for poison damage
you know let's see if it works how about
that I don't I don't want to steer you
wrong well you know it'll be it'll be a
nice little adventure about that what
you know it's gettin to the end of
stream so we can take risks alright cuz
I can still use this this time and that
gets him up to 900 10 points ok so use
my Shiv here and we're just gonna we're
just gonna concentrate on the boss
because once you defeat the boss
everyone else is defeated so let's just
see what happens and I could get another
catalyst dude you got this yeah but I
won't have the points just say fuck it
let's just do it let's see what happens
let's just see what happens rich
thanks on my car's okay all right all
right
all right this might work all right so
now we triple it all your cards first
okay go back okay so this is just free
for damage yeah this I draw a card and
then have to discard a card this applies
to week and for damage so I could do
that to one of these guys you have
anything that gets you extra energy in
your deck you know I could try drawing a
new card I mean do you have anything in
your deck that would do that yes okay
okay yes I do I actually have a couple
cards yeah well I tried trying a new
card because this doesn't cost me
anything more imposing poison that
doesn't super help though okay when were
the three triples you'll be doing all
right maybe let's give it a shot triple
triple and oh sweet fucking sweet then
we hit him with the Shiv
so heat by the way look yes
200 if I can survive this barrage I will
and I can I can survive this i neva need
this because they're just gonna hit me
for eight Nate that was absolutely the
right call look at it look at that
I'll just see all this shit I don't have
to do any of this I'm just gonna end my
turn
you got this I'm just gonna end my turn
I hit him for 250 poison that's great
that was a great call rich great call I
don't no problem no problem Jack
how long would one world take you could
take me Wow we can end it how long
what's our up time who's up times
recently can someone give me enough time
all I'm leaving you watch our up times
I'm gonna take a look these we're like
well like what time we start what - when
we serve yeah close two to four hours
ten minutes okay yeah potions always
drop after time at least not up to
relics draw two additional cards each
turn but start each combat confused no
no way elites now dropped two relics
when defeated that could be very helpful
or potions always drop after combat that
that's useful potions so what time is so
it's it's four hours and ten minutes so
what time is it what does that say it's
gonna at six it's 5:55 alright yeah then
we should call it you wanna call I think
so if you think you can do it I won't
stop you from having your glorious
moment where you hunker this it stream
it's gonna take me another hour I know
I'm just saying if you want to do it I
got your back man I you know what I feel
like what's gonna happen is it's gonna
end in disaster and like right now we
hit a high point we just poisoned the
fuck out of a big bad boss and I like
ending on a high point and so even
though it could be glorious just do it
just do it ya know we should go okay go
I think that's the smart call but that's
the game that's the game game I've
really enjoyed I could look at this one
do it do it
give like Super Bowl party to go to like
no I just here it's a really selfish
reason which I'd like that was a nice hi
I know that was a really nice flight and
I know and I don't want to I don't want
to spoil the hi alright alright so
that's my that's my slightly selfish
reason
oh but actually you know what
for anyone who plays this game there is
a bit of a weird save glitch there's a
way to choose your battles yeah it
doesn't it doesn't save until you start
the next battle ok so if I were to save
now and go back I would actually have to
replay that boss back yeah so if you end
up really fucking up you can just quit
save and take the whole boss battle so
I'm gonna I'm gonna start my next battle
and then okay so I can cheese she asked
a little bit
no I'm saying
are you gonna continue this oh yeah okay
okay Hecky I'm gonna continue that
hopefully hopefully yeah it saves to the
cloud right maybe maybe I want to see
your disinterested reaction to the solo
trailer but our is it is it do we know
if it's really happening even even know
if it's shown yet the game even started
the game started around six I have no
idea and I just don't care
I don't care about the solo trailer I
don't care about the Super Bowl

I'm sure it means something all the
missed 27 Feridun - 7 7 - says a couple
weeks back my computer's psu died power
supply unit power supply unit died when
I got it fixed all five of my drives
were dead all my backups of my movie
scripts test photography production
notes all gone so I have to start from
scratch movies are hard
that's a by the way that's a great in
first of all there might be a service
where someone can you know reconstruct
dead drives that sounds weird from a
power supply unit unless the power
supply unit died
because of some electrical problem I
guess it still seems weird it's yeah
seems very strange I would take it to a
service if it's all that important but
hey cautionary tale for everyone
anything that's very important to you
back up on a separate Drive a an
external drive that you keep off of your
computer even if you have a hard drive
partitioned it doesn't guarantee that
snot you know necessarily a good backup
anything important separate external
hard drive all of our footage or at
least when I'm editing I usually you
know delete the backups after a while
but you know there's one editing drive
and then I have a dedicated backup drive
that's a separate box just to make sure
in case anything gets fried but I would
look into a service to have that stuff
reconstructed for you and might cost a
little money but it sounds like it might
be worth it booty smack Iraq for 16
months in a row says thank you guys for
the years of great entertainment what is
your favorite show or cartoon from the
90s Batman the Animated Series that's a

great one too you know there was that
