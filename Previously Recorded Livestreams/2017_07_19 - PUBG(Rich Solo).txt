like I'm I'm streaming I say the little
green dot how's everyone doing what's
what's what's the haps I don't know I
know what people say I don't know thinks
again I got this stupid game here I
don't know why I'm gonna give this game
another shot I had a hard time picking a
game to stream out tonight
I was looking for something I could
stream while talking and Friday the 13th
that's so far I've been pretty good for
that I think but now I get it 10 seconds
after I start what's going on
our garden is another important
I played Friday the 13th to death I'm
probably gonna switch to it later anyway
it seems like there's a lot of downtime
in this
so thanks fine fine see what's going on
it's gonna this give this another chance
so 20 minutes of this and then Friday
the 13th at probably probably I wanted
to play the end his knife some more but
everyone in the chat when I brought that
up was like no we hate it we hate the
end of rich we we hate that game you did
the voice for it a few cutscenes lit
today watching it
so like I said I'm playing this because
it seems I don't know a lot a lot of
downtime while you're not really doing
anything or you're running to the next
area and maybe I won't be as intensely
focused on what I need to do I'm dealing
with Jax bindings well now while we're
fine
I'm not using a controller
alright well we can't release the per
shirt we go way too early
Oh God
can I follow my deaf can you do that
will you be willing to fall to your
death
these wonderful buttons by your thumb on
this Mouse and Jack finds everything -
these fucking awkward top buttons
fucking I don't fucking get it I don't I
don't fucking get it I gotta find a gun
and shoot that guy
we'll have armor upstairs
oh that's his shit sure equip I'm not
using a fucking controllers
same fucking face
and don't drop I just
how do I get out of this stupid there we
go
unless I keeps showing me the worthless
console button prompts
got a cool point they'll obviously love
the controller back
what but Mr Mapp now Jack all right we
are in the mission zone where we are
currently in the mission zone
grenade I'll take a grenade
all right
so no no idea what I'm doing but I'm
gonna keep looting shit
Molotov cocktail alright I'm assuming
that kind of shits better to use when
you're working with a team
thank you all right stop adding me
you're covering up my minimap I can't
see what the fuck I'm doing
gosh darn it out all right that that
fucks it my plan to get closer to the
center of the circle
I guess we'll head of here see what the
fuck that is
as the next restriction of the circle is
it always centered
risk running in here someone's been here
it's probably war zone going on in there
you know check out these houses
it's probably like I said like a sea of
vermin in that city
I'm gonna guess whoever's been here has
actually moved on thank you
backpack
oh no I don't want that
give me back my ek yeah why'd you unload
yourself
all right we're heading to the big city
thank you where we will inevitably die
you don't have any kind of body armor
windows gonna play the the Update mag
game there we go now the the update
thing's been around well you just
usually can't hear it
see anybody assuming I'm safe
friendly long stretches without seeing
anything happened in this game tell you
I want to slip machine-gun guess there's
no reason they would all it replaces the
how much it replace the
no no I think I am okay with the aka and
the shotgun which way am I facing where
am I at
I look for car
you know what we'll look for a car
how do you know someone is near by you
I'm being told someone is nearby but I
have no idea how to make that detection
all right well I also have the sound
down on my TV a little bit so it doesn't
pick up on my mic
I have to use heads I don't have
headphones right now
all right
exude this match let's try again try to
good
hit tab does it look like they can hit
tab
No ah fuck
now I gotta reload that's fine
oh it's awful um what is what is this
command that tab is usually bound you
called
hold breath just a normal inventory
button
P cried peak left
weapon title prone title Crouch jump
sprint walk previous weapon reload
targeting Oh
aiming user interface delete marker
he's bandage
their selfie use first aid mm-hmm it's
lying blade sling blades something
people don't reference anymore
slang why'd the fuck is he talking about
all right toggle inventory or does it
just say inventory I'm going with toggle
inventory right all right I'll do that I
think I should use that all the time it
is now bound to something apply or apply
that's not letting me click on apply'
hopefully there's all stuck
okay
okay all right here we go again
nope it did not apply any of my bindings
this looks like a decent spot I don't
see anyone else in the air I don't see
one person so I'm gonna should i murder
him am i right
and he's gonna find a weapon first and
I'm gonna be dead so hurry up and land
you cock number
all right
yeah this inventory button do this quick
okay you have to drag yeah
that that inventory button worked great
I didn't even see guns
I'm not trying to teammate mode one
without jack and second with a group of
strangers especially when I don't know
this game that would just be a horrible
experience with headphones on there's no
game audio for you well alright you know
what if I hear any more bitching we're
going right to Friday the 13th anywhere
bitching
some people get to start with guns or
something
oh wait that's about now cheese question
why isn't the button working right
all right
all right so some action going on in
here somewhere
ha
I'm not doing team games with a bunch of
fucking strangers how much joy at the
game I'm not look if I if I fix the
audio that means I'm not gonna be able
to hear shit in the game ah fuck it
I don't give a shit about this game
anyway can't hear it you need help
fuck it fuck it
Lala in the
what didn't want to do that issues with
one of my buttons here well we are
certainly fucked now
where we're gonna get a better start
there's good by the time I land
everyone's gonna be armed and runnin
around I didn't mean to open my shoot
too soon that wasn't it was an accident
oh don't worry I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna
be good I'm not gonna be done with this
game all night
trying to land in an area with only a
few buildings and denser areas and where
most people go I know but if I do that
I'm I'm not gonna find anybody to shoot
and it's gonna be ultra boring I don't
want it to be ultra boring and I don't
want to avoid the combat because then
you never get better at it
I'm in hell I'm in hell
first I got mics are the worst I mute
everyone going out I want to mute
everyone
absolutely everyone there awful all of
them
all this should be insane
no I have I have the reaction time of a
39 year old man potentially because I'm
a 39 year old man I lie to that balcony
yeah that buttons not working as well as
it needs to that's an important button I
just bought this mouse
all right obviously that button needs to
be changed
all right
I only get to give this I don't know how
many more shots are gonna give this a
lot of sleep why am i running the game
at 7:00 I don't give a shit what the
resolution is on this right now
I didn't even look honestly
we change graphics right now I'm sorry
Oh oh fuck that's wonderful
that rich was done with this guy he's
giving it another shot in the interest
of having something to stream something
that I can talk over
straight fucking down that's what we're
doing
how are these people getting lower than
maybe I was like jump out of plane
straight down as fast as I could I don't
know ma'am
which the helmets didn't look so stupid
and I was a guy in one of these houses
he's probably still around
but where
where is the question
where is my prey
you know what slightly better color shit
all right we need a backpack kind of
want that scope
you know I like the camel camel one
looks nice it was that wait love one
yeah I don't want one more water
I would kill somebody for a backpack so
something I can drop
other guys probably still in the area
right what was that what was that I
heard something
does that scope not let you actually
scope Oh
that's what I want we're in the zone
not saying anyone to shoot I'd like to
kill someone someone else killed one
person
I also like a backpack
can I need a backpack
and I could use like a really cool
helmet
oh no windows you're not restarting I'm
leaving behind armor upgrade I
I don't know what's better
I can't even carry armor upgrades
I think I'm just gonna hang out in this
room for a bit and see if I can spot
anyone
I have a level 2 vest already I thought
I had the level I thought this is a well
fucking we're on back
I was that
oh I thought I had I thought I never on
I just made a mistake
it happens all right dudes I thought
they were both level two and I just like
the one more go prone went on the roof
all right all right
should I hang out here I guess I can
wait all my video game experience I know
we want to close the fucking doors
so so what now
I just I just stay up here until I see
somebody that that sounds fucking boring
I mean it sounds really fucking boring
I'm not I'm not gonna lie to you
squab note is great I don't have squad
they don't want to do it without Jack if
we ever do this again that's the final
fucking word Jack's really enjoying this
and I would be a complete fucking
asshole if I told yo dude squad without
you Jack
oh my god look I'm in an abandoned town
I don't have a backpack I guess I wait
to kill somebody and take theirs that's
the only plan I have all right all right
we'll be patient we'll be patient
that's a functional window yeah
here we got a shots
and definitely hear gunshots
all right I'm not wearing headphones
because when I was wearing headphones
everyone was bitching because they
couldn't hear game audio it is it is
what it is folks
and I don't dare go wandering around
because that other guy who landed in
this town might also be hanging out in a
roof wait this night did I hear that
George Romero died I live under a rock
alright now we got to move on fucking
roof
I wish we don't I gotta go shit
which way is that pointing I can't see
which way all right so kind of behind me
and we do not have a backpack
all right
this is this game is so exciting why am
i giving this a second chance what's
wrong with me I want I want to like a
multiplayer shooter I want to but
multiplayer shooters don't play like
doom and that is why I don't like them
I saw them
they're here somewhere
I did well that was Dulles fuck doing
well means Dulles fuck i sat in a rough
nothing happened
talk about talk about slave 1 no talking
about I'll talk about a little bit by
the Han Solo video I thought of
something app for the fact I predict
that the love interest is going to be a
secret rebel spy who's going to sell Han
Solo out or at least steal his goods to
fund the rebellion and just ditch Han
I'm just gonna use him when that happens
he's gonna say but I love you and she's
gonna say I know dismissively
sniffing you're welcome thank you for
showing up
oh there's some stuff that that didn't
make the cut that predicted the Kessel
run would also go through an asteroid
field
I also predicted that the Millennium
Falcon will have a third radar dish on
top that gets knocked off during the
chase
no I do not have titanfall - I'm gonna
land on the student I don't feel like
installing origin for it
why do people enjoy multiplayer shooters
but why do they enjoy this horseshit I I
barely landed and that guy has a fucking
machine gun how does that shit happen
who do you fall faster
I just want to murder everything and
it's this game so I know I won't
I'm assuming clothing is mostly just
cosmetic I'm assuming
do we miss the ammo for this bound to be
some in here right yeah or not yeah
thank you
you just want to run to a town and see
if we can kill someone that's what I
want maybe I'll shake this I'll check
this first
No
and you drop something
thank you
my fault
yeah now
all right all right now let's go to town
and die in a second that way how far out
of the mission now we're in the mission
zone all right all right I'm not too
worried about the mission zone
and that's probably people up there that
can murder me I'm sure they'd appreciate
my lewd
you believe in me I don't
all right why don't see any loot which I
assume means someone has been here right
been here on left where'd they go
probably over here
I could be anywhere
now I'm gonna go further in London
that's where I came from
but no I don't want a Java update
fucking windows
all right I don't know what the fuck I'm
doing I guess I'm just headed this way
suppose we could follow the main road
for a bit maybe we'll find a car live
fast die hard like I've been dying
pretty easy I don't think you've been
paying much attention to what's going on
here
yeah I want to check these houses I'm
gonna do it because I want to
there's so much better
alright alright they've been here I
don't expect to find much in this scenic
that's nice
we got time we got time
probably long ago looted
but not that one why why level one
I've got a least level one
I suppose they could have went in one of
the other 30 doors in that other house
yeah
alright I'll move on maybe it'll be fun
somewhere up ahead looking for fun
that's what I'm looting for I'm looting
for fun
that's bombing going AAB there
probably dangerous at this point to head
towards that city right
my other peek but is not working
yeah we're gonna crouch up and head
towards these houses hopefully there'll
be some fun in there
what's the difference between that what
I have none are the same
can I'll take anymore all right it's my
backpack full
yeah I need a bigger backpack I get it
oh I was treating play area area you
know the play area is restricted it's a
restricted play area
there was drinking the play area
you had to crawl like this look I I'm I
got a minute to get there
the killer blue was on its way
killer blue does not want me to have any
fun
yeah I'm coming back with this game only
because I'm worried i streamed Friday
the 13th too much though it's inevitable
I'm gonna end up playing it before the
night is through
fuck this
no that's not in the mission zone we
don't want to have that way
okay
ooh what's this ooh what's this
Oh
the focus that
windows
fuck this game fuck this game
ah yeah I want to exit this match by
exit this match I mean immediately
ah fuck that fuck that's so much fuck
that so hard
fuck that till it dies fuck everything
about that how does it feel to be forced
to run out because of the declining
circle to get sniped by the guy who was
in the middle of the circle from the
start of the game how's that feel how's
that feel and you think that fuck it
feels
