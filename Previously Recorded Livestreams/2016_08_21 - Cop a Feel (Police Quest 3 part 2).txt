xerath evil sounding name rich we the
twitch community know the perfect game
for you
it's a JRPG turn-based vampire fantasy
game with point-and-click elements and
QuickTime events at every turn
that's the rich saved rich saved
everything's fine
so yeah it's it should be a couple
blocks up now it's straight chop yeah I
think it's on your left it's right after
Rose
I think you have to pull in okay okay
nice nicely done rich
yes and we will do a sieve stream we've
talked about that we do want to do a
civilization from that will be fun just
because it's been a while since I played
don't talk to the man anything fun the
man doesn't want to talk to you you know
what everyone the point-and-click
experience the man wants his underpants
lock us in for storing my weapons before
entering the jail that's right
all weapons with that I guess I'm a comp
nightstick uh yeah sign reads Litton
county police department
admiral big eighty-nine yes someone
actually just recommended rimworld to us
as a sci-fi dwarf fortress rim job well
sounds like a fantastic game I'm looking
forward to it we put it on a list I want
I do want to do many board game streams
we're probably gonna get a ton in
October
mostly because I happen to have a lot of
spooky board games just this weekend
rich got a taste of a mysterium on that
fun mmm
neat game mysterium AKA ghost clue which
is a neat game that I think we could I
think we could have a really fun stream
out of mysterium house or what is it a
house on Haunted Hill or House of the
haunted manner or manor and the Hound
haunted house whatever it is we have
that one I have a lot of horror games
and so the prison has doors that just
open when you walk up to them it's not
it's not a very well thought out prison
we gotta do something about our highest
scape right well we could think it's a
big problem here we could just you know
lock these doors I told them personally
that I thought it was a mistake to build
the jail into the old supermarket I was
I was right about the security issues
they ignored me they were
there was there was a budget crisis
going on you know who are you why are
you why are you rushing me detective
officer Smith hey what happened to the
old guy what happened to the sir for the
way I'm another orange head surfer guy
he was a surfer right Jack huh oh that's
right yeah this guy's got gray hair Oh
me and the the years haven't been kind
of me something but it's only been a
year since I last saw you
yeah man I got scared really bad I was
surfing and a great white that you
didn't bite me and I was just
remembering a movie I saw me and gave me
flash because yeah that's it and even
saying that my hair just turned a little
more white dude just was very scary it
is I actually haven't seen it I just saw
the post hey earth to Sonny you gonna
give me this guy's belongings or what no
I just want to find some way to get the
jaws for because that is so fucked up
but I can't do it I can't do it I can't
give this the jaws for sorry I'm sorry I
keep circling around jaws and it's not
funny is the point I was a lot
I was trying and I was going with my own
bit and that I've actually never seen
jaws I just saw the poster but thinking
about that poster man scared the bejesus
out of me give me your stuff hey crying
you jerk listen up dink give me the
stuff no don't put the knife on the
glass man but the suspects knife into
the drawer what about his keys I'm sure
he had some sort of keys you got some
guts digging in that guy's Underpants
did you like it it's like I do every I
mean yes I have some guts
nothing nothing strange goes on at
Wang's
I grow it just eggrolls
definitely egg Moses yes that's what my
breath smells like it's egg rolls both
leave the road yes I will talk about
that rich hasn't seen it maybe we can
take a break and watch it and it's so
great which over watch blizzard recently
came out they make little animated
shorts for their characters and the new
one was just released called the last
bastion and Bastion is a character in
the game who's a robot
the whole backstory of the game is like
sentient robots versus people and there
was a big war anyway Sebastian is and
he's like a robot looking robot there's
one of the teams in overwatch robots a
lot of characters are robots but the
teams are mixed the teams are mixed yeah
ok and and like at one time it was
humans versus robots at one time they
work together like there's a lot of
backstory ok for a simple first-person
shooter but Bastion is a robot and this
animated short the last bastion is one
of those perfect examples of
storytelling without any dialogue
there's no there's no dialogue in it
it's just Bastion and his little bird
friend and it is gorgeous and wonderful
and if you're a fan of the game like I
am it just adds a whole new it adds a
layer to playing his Bastion and you
want to you just kind of want to give
the robot a hug he's beautiful
human versus robot well it's good to
praise your books bonds that's why it

like Pakistani and went a little Indian
with that or no don't you dare do that
if you do that I will so that was gross
and you just did that in everyone's here

was gross
if you can go northbound on your way out

corpse party octamer else it's a high
school horror anime his favorite the
game doesn't want me to know it's not
time to do that rich it's now time to
solve the puzzle that they said they
want you to solve what she's I can't see
her she's cut off but she is right there
oh ok the absent officer Moore the
officer morels black eyes challenge you
they actually wrote that the officer
Morales black eyes challenge you
the officer morels black eyes challenge
you she impresses me as being both
arrogant and stubborn she has against
more women that I do I mean that uniform
right grade nine band okay boss man you
handle it
why is the violator refusing to sign the
ticket who knows geez first I get this
stupid cow no I got a deal what you do
yeah yeah it's policy about going to
supervise fulfill you decide sucks look
I need you I'm taking a downtown no
you're not you're gonna stand right here
till I have a chance to talk to hahahaha
like I like your moxie I like that you
want to take it downtown but I'm the man
and I can't let you show me up so I'm
gonna get it aside in this thing to
prove I'm right the man is right also
everyone is correcting you on how you're
pronouncing her last name Moore Morales
Sonny Ponce wouldn't know that Morales
is Sonny bonds would fuck that up
I'm gonna keep saying Morales okay I did
get it legit wrong yeah but Sonny bonds
would definitely captured
Morales I'm sorry it's Morales what
my last name clearly I clearly gonna
read it it says morels the focus of
Morel is you know that's right salsa you
people like salsa right next time I go
to Wang's I'll get some Morales Verdes I
agree with rich it's funny if he just
keeps calling him calling her Morales
like Miles Morales right there's what
woman in the guy she looks upset but not
dangerous my hand grips my gun just in
case oh wait were you okay that's fine
apparently that's fine looking at the
young lady I see that she's pregnant
nearly full-term which means I got here
too late but I introduced myself to the
woman and say and say and say and I'm
working myself up to it she's pregnant
but she's still quite attractive you're
into the into the baby bump
well she's so close to term I probably
only have to wait another week or two
dr. smoke trees says you should in fact
the say she needs to wait longer to heal
but dr. smoke crew says you should check
your anus for weapons by the way check
this fearsome weapon do you have to
click on anything obey the watch waiting
side mid site whoa I couldn't read oh my
god I don't want to hit that I don't
care you I don't care you think I'm
afraid to sign a stripper ticket the
kick stop scrolling so fast text what a
waste of my tax money well that's good
you do that she's rude abusive insulting
I refused to sign a ticket for anyone
who calls me a fat girl
would you please reconsider inside the
citation because quite frankly you're
quite fat here no take me to jail I
don't give a fuck I am Who I am yeah
you know I'm sorry I'm sorry it got me a
little weird what should I do with this
lady I think old farmer John's place is
just too far down the road really so you
probably have to like help get the baby
out now right is that gonna be the bit
the woman only winces as though her
emotion of the situation is causing a
physical stress you cannot beat the baby
out of her wrist you cannot damn it I
can't do any of the things I want to do
today you are not allowed to beat the
baby out of her that is not how it works
tires out uh yeah yeah I'm rich you
gotta you got to think your way out of
this one I think you have to talk to
officer and what I'll Adams I assume I'd
say what's up bitch you were being a
bitch to that cut off yeah all right
Morales the violator said you were
abusive and rude why don't I have a hard
time believing that like such is
obviously the ladies hysterical she's
pop softly you look very funny
she's been belligerent in hostel ever
since I stopped her she's begging for a
night in jail so what you want to do
boss man yeah witness her failure to
sign or take her to jail what do you
want to wear Sonny Ponce we're a Sonny
fuckin pot absolutely your choice man
the game now I know damn well hmm the
game won't pay decided but I'm Sonny
Ponce
all right this pigs gonna bring that pig
in brilliant deduction shit like like I
said before I was already sure to take
your dad town the excitement of trauma
of the incident was more than enough to
do the woman's labor oh no the
complications that resulted was
sufficient to bring sizeable lawsuit
against the department hmm Sonny ends up
with non compensated days of procedure
as resulted in a 100 looking dollar
lawsuit Wow hold on where's the police
procedure on them bonds way
well that's no fun no fun all that I'm
I'm checking at
I'm checking if there's any sort of like
procedure that would have warned us
against that obviously the correct thing
to do was to you know waive the
signature but all right that's fine well
because it's what the suits want I sign
its auto-scrolling again and I can't
read any of this right
god damn it game let me read the things
the woman only winces as though the
emotion of the situation is cutting off
the sentencing I am
you'll god damn it ah you goddamn cops
are giving me guess
oh I fear a guy if you have a guest
coming oh it's a fuck but it's coming
out the front what's that called oh I
got a Khalif all over the place Jesus
Christ you're going the Ghostbusters
route
what doesn't she look like she would be
in the Ghostbusters
I'm gonna talk about my lady parts and
that's gonna be good for me
can we have an e mode of that woman's
face maybe I might be able to get a
usable I guess I could slow down the
game speed walking everything slower -
yeah presumably no go away yeah we walk
a lot oh look at that it's not worth the
text no no that makes sense into like a
southern a Southern gentleman police
officer unit 603 it says here is the
money to go by quest for glory one
through five there's a sale on GOG I own
the fuck out of them but the grinding
those games have grinding hmm there are
stats you do things repeatedly to get
those stats up thank you
I remember what every single game it was
a fucking huge pain in the ass level of
sneaking you know by its nature do you
walk it just do walking so you walk
everywhere slow for half the game the
level up you're sneaking oh they're all
unit 603 did is also suggesting a good
LucasArts point click like loom or
monkey island life whenever I haven't
played anything I mean I loved that
quest for glory games yeah actually I
played it before they were forced to
change the name originally was just
hero's quest hmm there's some kind of
legal issue though with the hero's quest
name they couldn't use that he's in
hero's quest the the like light Dungeons
& Dragons Gantt board game yeah but I
don't know it must have been first I I
don't have to write I don't know the
details of whatever it was they hadn't
changed the name it became quest for
glory sure and I like the games actually
I love the second one the second one is
probably my favorite Sierra game and I
like the Sierra games the fourth one is
actually a point-and-click that I like
third one's garbage it's a pretty yeah
third one is fucking hot I think I
remember the board the board game was
supposed to be
like an introductory sport game was
supposed to be an introduction I'm
talking about the game I remember seeing
the box it's it's supposed to be like an
introduction for people into like
Dungeons & Dragons where it's like a
preset out dungeon and you don't need a
Dungeon Master
I don't know if I have it anymore I used
to have the copy of quest for glory one
when it's still called hero's quest oh I
see if you find that that's fun that's
fun I know I don't know I'm sorry this
is a slight chance I've got a digital
backup of it somewhere sure sure here
and MC Lucas says thanks for the stream
as always rich sorry you're frustrated
with pc3 that was fine oh please Chris
it's fine but I honestly can't blame me
this game is bullshit and seems to
cock-block you at every turn
yep hang in there I want to dispatch
what do I do next dispatch does anyone
need me to oh I can't I can't do that
all right I guess we're gonna try and
get back to the station we can get back
to the station I'm sure I'm maybe you're
on the freer on the freeway now right
eastbound on 41 ok the next exit
tell me when you get to that exact it's
a it's a ways it's after 9th Street I
just realized I'm going ten miles an
hour on the freeway yeah you probably
want to go freeway speeds on the freeway
all right I think as soon as that green
sign pops yeah actually um I don't know
what you're gonna do now because you
might might just end freeway since I've
reached the end of my jurisdiction I'd
turn around in the head in the other
direction Oh actually that that is more
helpful so now you want to wait until
you get to the sixth Avenue exit Oak
Avenue wow that guy's going really fast
Oh see if you're gonna catch him
yeah hold on I will do I have a
speedometer I have it a radar how do I
do traffic officer maintain high
visibility pay attention speeding to
excessive speed yep for officer safety
make right hand approaches be
professional
well yeah go see if you can get him is I
gonna fuck me because I don't have a
radar gun it's like a radar car gun in
the front oh maybe yeah yeah just go
talk to him anyway
see what you do gas it up what even
though I clearly clicked on the button
to turn on my siren and I went to hit
the gas I have decided not to pull over
the vehicle
that's a bold decision there Sonny
bullets low decision that I did not make
that would be too fun peach Avenue maybe
that's something you wanna get out fun
huh
hold your horses where are we uh yeah
you can get up on peach yep oh maybe I
clipped it twice or something in my
haste to
are you trying to pulling over again
where is it where to go we didn't speed
up go faster pedal pedal to the limit
nice never the vehicle sees my lights
and finally begins to full of shit yeah
oh we got this alright let me get to the
proper procedures for for pulling over
Oh oh shit large man getting out he has
something in his hands that I cannot
identify and I hold on hold on you hear
the man yell to you police officer oh I
was oh shit are we kosher here
go get him sorry if I screwed you up
what what hell I was speeding you didn't
know me from Adam I'm out of here
peace out brother thank you autos
scrolling text that I can get to read
any of that so he was an undercover he
was a cop tailing a drug runner okay but
there was no puzzle involved there no
like you didn't have to like check an ID

traffic stops okay yes stolen car it's
gonna be a stolen car jet for officers
safety make right-hand approaches be
professional remember that you are
representing the department violators
should be treated firmly but with
courtesy make sure you have sufficient
evidence for successful prosecutions a
search and handcuff all prisoners patrol
the freeway at 55 miles per hour and pay
attention to the flow of traffic extreme
caution must be used while opening code
3 red light and sirens use radio
sparingly notice to appear ticket
writing to successfully obtain a
driver's notice to appear to be of a
buck you think because it's a year off
it's a stolen car
going to issue a citation for beating
traffic God I'll believe this Brown just
try it keep from getting bugs all over
the windshield
look at this Irvin number written on the
actual fucking car oh you fucking game

wickety wackety waka waka absolutely
smear shitty button iPhone windshield we
got rid of the but knife we no longer
have the but knife oh maybe it says how
the computer works game game oh by the
way the way they have the manual here is
all effed up yeah but I just see the
part now about refusal to sign a
citation the violator will be required
to post bond before being released the
violator will will go to jail if they
refuse to sign exception pregnant women
and the elderly mm-hmm
advise the violator as above the
violator still refuses to sign a
citation call supervisor so great
his light I did put his fucking license
in a goddamn computer I'm looking up the
computer what are you do I don't know

plate or the Li number oh oh oh what's
that doing nothing can you click on Li
down there
I don't know rich I don't know I don't

we've tried uninstalling the game
because that might wait oh wait wait can
you go into your inventory in the car
seat and physically put the license in
the machine that is a pretty good idea

the game or get out of here quit and
maybe it's on your on your in your car
yeah how do we know what time it is
all right invalid entry nope no no okay
is that is that the time right above the
computer can you look at that before you
do that can't look at that it says 1901
but I don't know if that's the time how
do we know what time it is
could the time beyond the - that's what
I was thinking but it doesn't look like
it is anything a manual about that
equipment there was a there's a thing on
military time how long but I assumed
that was just telling us how to read
military time and I know how to read it
vehicle code
there's a thing telling us how to read
military time but not oh it's your 1901
yeah I went out there saying 1401 is
really wrong it could be it could be
either we don't know I'm going with 1901
perfect vehicle code what was it two two
driving too slow oh oh sure give me one
moment here I will tell you what the
code is there are codes for this
situation here playing a police quest
game and the chat wants us to uninstall
the game mmm and then sane it's a
different game say not info code for
evading arrest driving under the
influence reckless driving exceeding the
maximum speed limit following too close
driving too slow in the fast lane is two
one six five four boom you did it rich
congratulations congratulations
I'm sure I wouldn't get them of the Year
thing I don't think that's I don't think
that's supposed to be a thing all right
teams you have two darks is Jack
obviously prereq and rlm in general
contains a lot of inappropriate content
how do you prevent your kids from
stumbling onto your streams they don't
really have access to a lot of computer
time by themselves as they're very ie
man you pigs make me wanna puke man I'll
see you in the People's Court man nice
totally passing as a Hispanic you are
yes judge Wapner will take care of you
you see you see and you have a nice day
sir when they do get like YouTube time

across it and that's just gonna be fine
like I said you know the oldest the
their cousin their cousin now thug so OH
tracking device so one day they'll run
they'll come across it and I'm sure like
any parent I will be a huge
embarrassment but that's okay and

one dropped today Wow Wow he wrote an
award-winning album like 15 years ago

latest and greatest in hip-hop and R&B;
news it's true I ain't doing it up ahead
we see a car waving and you know what oh
we've seen so many things on the road
I'm no longer excited by this
development oh this is now mundane well
it's a drunk driver so he'll probably to
a recipe to walk up and talk to him I'm
not gonna be able to do anything and
