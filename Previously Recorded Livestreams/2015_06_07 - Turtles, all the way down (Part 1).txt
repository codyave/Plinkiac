I'm going to play the unloved Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles out of the shadow
out of the shadows game and I like it
nobody else does except for me but I
like it and really that's all that
matters
how's everyone else doing I'm now you're
doing good that's good I'm glad you're
doing good I'm fine I'm just fine and
also split Asst thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
all right this is not a solo stream Jack
is going to crash in on the party round
round 8:30 Ronnie oh this kids bedtime
and we're probably gonna have to pause
the stream and fuck around with audio
once he gets in because there's no way I
could adjust for for Jack leftover
beefcake thank you for subscribing we
really appreciate it seven months in a
row uhme remix thank you for subscribing
and it's your one-year anniversary
twelve months in a row holy shit we were
doing this crap for a year
thank you for subscribing for a fucking
year I should start the game now I guess
right I mean that's a thing that you
probably happened all right here we go
here we go I'm turning this game on I
was fucking around with earlier we're
going to the main menu nuts well yeah
the main menu item why the fuck not
going up going to the main menu and the
sound in my headphones is pretty loud
huh how's the sound and everything
we're sounding good this is probably the
song I should have started the stream
with this game keeps kicking you out of
full screen mode and I don't know why it
does that it's it's kind of annoying
kind of annoying keeps wanting to go to
windowed mode well you want to loosen
this song for good will you listen to
this song for a bit yes these turtles do
look better than the bay turtles
actually on my my Steam whatever I did
post a picture of the screenshot of this
game saying you know this is this is
what realistic Ninja Turtle should look
like why all right you're asking me why
this game is good it's well it's got its
got some technical flaws like this is
the first time in years I've had issues
with a camera in a game I mean cameras
are something that mostly gotten figured
out well so this game you know it's a
little buggy at times but I like to
combat the combat is I would describe it
as a hybrid brawler
like like back in the day old old rulers
like God of War and Ninja Gaiden were
like combo based you've learned the
moves and then you use the moves in the
game and then Batman Arkham Asylum kind
of took a different look at brawlers and
Batman Arkham Asylum turned brawlers and
it kind of like a a rhythm based keep
your combo up and and this game kind of
blends both like there's there's there's
a counter button like an Arkham Asylum
there's a combo counter and would you
get the combo high enough you can do
special moves just like an Arkham Asylum
but there's still there's still a combo
system like in like a ninja gaiden I'm
still in control of what moves I use so
it's like it's like right in between
that kind of old-school ninja gaiden
call our add up Arkham game alright
start the game
and there's the the lair it's kind of an
odd game in the way that clearly things
are based on the the current Nickelodeon
cartoon but they they made it look
realistic like it's it's kind of based
on a TV show that's meant to be enjoyed
by 10 year olds but they're still trying
to appeal to 30 year olds which is fine
actually I kind of discovered the
Nickelodeon show because of this game
and actually a really big fan of the
first season of the the current
Nickelodeon Ninja Turtles all right I'm
gonna start the campaign chapter one
sure ninja mode I don't know classic
mode I think that just makes a black and
white which is a cute touch but we're
not doing that
and I'm Leo fan are the TMNT superheroes
no they're ninjas who happened to be
Turtles
we buck bebop and rocksteady you're
pretty good in the new show yeah I never
much cared for bebop Rocksteady here's
here's my Ninja Turtles bias okay when
the Ninja Turtles came out when I was a
kid I actually my first my first
experience with turtles from the toys
themselves
I remember the toy commercials and I
remember the toys and I remember getting
a few of the toys and I thought they
were really beat and then I start a few
episodes of the TV show I mean I like
the TV show when I was a kid I liked it
well enough but then I watch a this is
actually this is a more important story
this is the story of how I came to love
comic books because the local comic book
store this had the Vino quest at the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles all taking
that was epic comics Friday after school
right my treat with me I would go to the
comic book store and I would play the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game
from playing the arcade game at the
comic book store I eventually discovered
the big black and white Ninja Turtles
comic books and I was like oh my god
this is fucking awesome I love the
original comic pick turtles the black
and white turtles for they all wear the
red headbands a lot more than I like the
cartoon I kind of hate the the 80s 90s
cartoon
too cheesy for me even when I was a kid
it's too cheesy
especially when they had to stop using
her weapons I couldn't stand the fact
that the the villains of the cartoon
show were all idiots can't can't stand
my villains being stupid here we go and
then I'm playing the game I'm not
talking bush you know what fuck it I'm
just gonna I'm gonna declare this a no
death run it's a short game it's doable
hey guys it's very doable
and if I'm not talking enough from you
briea Jack shows up at 8:30 listen talk
button which is kind of neat you get
bonuses for the taunts like Leo if he
taunts like before the start of invited
some people start hitting each other all
of the turtles get like a damage boost
Raphael does a taunt after he gets hint
he can regain health
they gave each character their own mood
scent and a little bit of a little bit
of personality
nothing we're fine here all quiet carry
on
definitely enero actually hitting not
robots with a sword yeah and in the
comic books
Leonardo was not afraid to hack somebody
up like the The Foot Clan in the classic
black and white comics yeah they were
they were not robots and well things got
bloody and it was it was good fun now as
a kid I like r-rated entertainment
violence is a grand thing
okay I give up what the heck is all this
stuff this is amazing high-tech stuff I
could build almost anything out of this
could you build a robot yeah could you
build a flying skateboard yeah could you
build a pizza uh let's cut you here -
yes that gets a pizza oven but wait that
smells awesome pizza
stay focused Mikey we got to catch up to
those purple dragons don't don't use it
much but there is hey we are stealth
mechanics get down guys behind those
dumpsters
okay they're leaving look here's a
purple dragon headed down the alley
aw the poor guys all by himself mine
and that gets a way that fucking fiends
get out of my way Michelangelo
and stealth stealth initiated
it's down
do you know that ninjas are supposed to
be quiet
nice these guys let's head for higher
ground right here and Raphael ofcourse
is appropriately brutal his attacks all
look like they hurt look at this look at
this look at that knee to the feet of
the fucking space rebels we give a shit
of course they all get to a secondary
kind of weapon in this game and Rafael's
of course just iron iron fucking gloves
come on come on
one piece of me
all right moving right along you want to
break somebody's arms this record he's
got a probe a guess technically he's not
breaking the arm I think it's supposed
to be a submission but looks an awful
lot like he's trying to break somebody's
arm which Pelley appropriate for a feel
they are but did you seriously just say
holy cats
the bigger they are save it turtle time
I love this life get out of the way
nice
I'll see you can switch through the
turtle tempte anytime obviously cuz I'm
doing and I want to do a counter-attack
fucking attacked me they're afraid
they're fucking afraid of me they should
be
look you're out of bag yeah I just
started a little bit early you didn't
miss much
this is he okay first stage fairly early
on in the first stage yes it's there
Nick stop their next takedown
hey I've arbitrarily decided this is
going to be a no death run it's not
gonna be innocent it should your case
being especially challenging no death
run yeah why not even faster and stay
out of sight
why not well of the way they run dude
even ninjas need fuel
yeah parkour beware my parkour
oops
all right I haven't used my key yet have
I
these might give it that's a knife
you know you boys shouldn't play with
sharp things and definitely don't relish
it
boy have I learned that
down he goes yeah you did that some
celebrating
let's get acquainted
whoa come here Punk
and welcome to the stream rich loves new
Keith glad you could make it for a
change your first time can see what all
the fuss is about and you get to be
horribly disappointed
seeing the camera is not perfect in this
game usually it's not even it's not even
good but I like the game anyway
in part because I really do like combat
me also because I really like turtles so
it's all over but the falling damn chump
right now my best that fight not my best
though splatoon I don't own a wii-u I
don't have splatoon the purple dragons
hey I cannot play splatoon for a number
of reasons
it's the tcri building what I can't
figure out is that company belongs to
those rich loves nuki thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
why would they be jackal jackal be here
later first first hour this is probably
no gonna be rich soulless room then jack
will show up
a bit of stealth action here
oh yeah
hurry up
you fuckers
Monni I figure out what's going on take
him down I'll take him down there we go
a video game AI everyone hang back a sec
technically this game is supposed to
have co-op online co-op this is their
valcon now this is the major reason
everybody in the world except for me
hates this game it's supposed to have
co-op it doesn't work so they fucked up
big time
big time they've never patched it
they've never tried to get it working
before and people are rightfully I mean
you know me yeah I don't give a shit
about multiplayer though in this one
instance I think it would be fun you
know no multiplayer for this game
we go
ninjas always
that shellshock why do they call that
show combinations
check this out I needed a step sale
come on everyone saw that right
pouring it combination stop okay
that's that
shell-shocked sorry I'm too busy kicking
ass the time she's kicking ass it's all
good
aliens now what's what's even happening
I'm playing the Ninja Turtles game the
unloved Ninja Turtles game and Dad no no
Karen today Jack will be by later if I
know I know I'm kind of quiet when I'm
alone less than an hour from now Jack
should be around
any opinion on The Witcher 3 not not
really
I couldn't even play the first night the
combat in the first one I hated it so
much I couldn't I couldn't play the game
so I've never played any of the other
games in The Witcher series I'm sure you
know I'm sure is great couldn't get past
the first one
all right
bring it come here that's the turtle way
down in the tunnels come in it this way
use Leo levels got a rapper bit got the
pizza here
and not gonna be self graph isn't subtle
graph would not use Dolph he would you
know he would what he was doing he would
just charge up to somebody and punch
them right in the face
oh yeah
yeah yeah come here yeah
this new hacking device Donnie made for
me
Steve the mini-game portion of the game
how you open the doors had a turtle get
out of my fucking way get out of my
fuckin get out of my fucking way yeah it
would be great if you could do co-op
technically it's it's there's a menu but
you'll just you'll just never be able to
connect to a game it's never happen
anybody actually has this games and
knows of a trick some way to get the
co-op working let me know maybe maybe
before the day is out we'll try I don't
think anything will come of it but we'll
try
we got company let's go
check this out
you know have not been able to do any of
Raphael's crowns little ground moves
because these people keep dying to write
and seem to be doing fief work for the
foot since when is that I'm sure in the
later levels they weren't died what has
gone it's not baby
scars so now they're made out of tissue
extremely well then again I am I am
playing I'm not doing this playthrough
from scratch well I'm not nearly fully
level I gotta do some upgrading on Donna
yet
I was looking at the chat finally I'm
sweating into a wall
everyone now really
let's get acquainted
but son the next X con game excited
they're making one
hey better thoughts on it in the last
stream we did I don't want to spend a
lot of time going over again because I'm
just gonna end up repeating self every
every stream we do I looking forward to
out of weather making one I want to I
want to see some gameplay footage though
before I actually really say much of
anything about the game take me
Wow fucking camera that was sweet
nobody here
subway tunnels I've never even seen them
on a map come on there have to be about
support sections of the subway
but apparently shredder is eating entire
sections existence from everyone else it
is a personal subway system no cops no
Transit Authority
you're telling us this why well they
could have a secret foot soldier
underground city
they could have foot soldier malls and
and foot soldier boutiques a foot
soldier movie theater foot soldier kiosk
selling foot soldier cell phone covers
come on back Mikey
right now there might be more info
floating around there on next time -
right now all I've seen is the new
trailer sorry this is the employee train
fellas we're gonna have to throw you off
I'm sure I'm sure I hear tales well here
we go all about its royalness suspense I
guess so I know so which which TMNT is
this game based on well I probably most
closely resembles the current
Nickelodeon TV show and it's more mostly
it's it's own thing
not bad guys
Oh
where's Ben Alice he's on he's on Skid
Row
analyze is on skipper let's find a way
out
need to regroup and figure out what's
going on
I'll show you the upgrade stuff on
so the green means they're unlocked so
I've got most those things unlocked
which kind of violence lake are
decreased health
I have no idea I have no idea
yeah we're doing that one it's fine it's
fine stop fine you're up fine choices
leave it be
what are the chances of my singing the
80s TMNT theme song zero zero like I
said I was a fan of the comic books less
so of the classic TV show look at this
they have a mode where they all have the
red headbands like the classic comics
for the sake of you watching this you
can keep track of who's who I'm leaving
it off but it's neat they do that
where do I see the TMNT and 500 years
under a pile of radioactive ash like
everything else has to come home I
believe he said we were exhausted and
needed rest so we're just going to
ignore Master Splinter everyone cool it
whoa whoa hold up what pizza we got
pizza okay more than okay Pizza Shh
hang on I hear something it's more
purple dragons okay everyone keep cool
what'd you guys get cut off from the
rest of them
rich doesn't even think will last 500
years yeah look after we developed nukes
we barely lasted 20 falling down Chuck
I'm in 20 years after we discovered a
way to destroy ourselves we almost did
it
what's the deal with the subway what are
you working on at some point in human
history somebody else is going to use a
dupe whoa I'm living feeling it's gonna
happen sooner or later subway get out of
here
forget it it's a bust you just you just
need the wrong people to get their hands
in a pot back to the lair we must and as
time goes by that's gonna get easier and
easier because the information is out
there and other people are trying to
develop these weapons our trail but they
know we were moving equipment through
the tunnels I am I should have any a
list of recent subscribers I'll go back
and read everybody when I get a break
I'll do it after the end of the day both
to the segment be right I have just the
thing
Arwen Jack calls him ever comes first
you swore the crane technology would
make your weapons
invincible do not let me down
why not just cut across the rooftops
it'd be faster I want to stay on a site
there were foot soldiers all over the
place tonight this way
time you start kicking some ass
it's something they do look like dogs
that's right conceptually I like ninjas
in this game they're not that they just
gotta eat
I missed I think I got everything moving
right along the masters are coming from
someone try to find the way to the
source
Mouser side hey Jack how you doing
I'll say hi properly I guess once you
actually call him but not gonna see in
the chat I'm just gonna say hello
awesome ninja weapon
face time come on oh there we go jump
down the fuckin hole how much how much
every how how difficult is that could
that be just jump in the hole
where's everybody still up here get down
the hole and let's continue on hey these
guys are competent their competence
they're not hitting things with sword
stabs they're competent
all right
power surge
break them down
PETA I mean more pizza but still
wife dial
everything'd I say you win games
everything dies and you win
all right
that's all of them out spin break him
down
victory dance so that was more mousers
want to fight people again
watch this
kick people in the face that is that too
much to ask
they just wanted to kick people in the
face I mean it's it's a ninja turtles
game that should be a priority
it's all over but the fallin down chump
that's the turtle way
bring it
come on come on
- Stockman is around here somewhere
Baxter and I don't like the idea that
they usually are
I think he's backing up the foot
for core
this is no ordinary tunnel nothing here
is as simple as it looks
do that bouncer explode on purpose
watch this
Ravager
Croucher
that's
yeah this one needs a reason
come here spin
here we go wait
what's this
it's all over but the fall and damn
chump my brothers watch this
I would kick things over here
I still miss kicking people
or at least people sighs things come
here
it feels like I'm beating up like
chipmunks
wait what's this
the trick is to inspire without sounding
like a fool
stuck on the stair there
no thanks I'm all set not not cool
looking to get stuck on the stairs
embarrassing but yeah
outstanding
Electrical ninja net
all right this few more being hurt
can you hurt turtles you can in the
world of mousers apparently
we go
yes
that's getting it done
grouchy
should be building up better combos in
this no fucking I'm doing fine powder
combos combos yes like in a video game
when you hit something a number that
goes up the top of the screen that's
your combo combo yeah I'm not talking
about the snack just wishes harm hijack
how you doing
you sound fine in my headphones now the
question is how do you sound in the
stream I thought I got rid of that when
I tested things can you hear me in the
stream can you hear it
yeah oh yeah I spent like an hour before
the stream getting rid of that and I did
and so it's just back yeah you Oh for
fuck's sake if they my headphones and in
the stream and it's not that bad in the
stream but it's there you know what's
causing it what the game when I recorded
without the game on it's gone
yeah Jack sounds good Jack is a bit low
I can turn myself up oh my god it's
getting louder rich
maybe it's because are you joining in
it's it's that do a thing
it's like crescendoing well I don't know
I don't know what to do I could start
and stop the stream and just hope it
gets better by magic
I could try turning the game audio off I
don't know what's more objectionable
that's the question I mean I'm not even
sure if that would work well I mumble
wasn't on when I tested it earlier yeah
maybe maybe that is maybe mumble is the
cost I don't know well I mean before
before I actually started the stream
that the buzz was that wasn't gone but
it was very low the game when I turn
when I recorded with the game off the
audio was crisp and clear if you see
yeah
power strange
I don't know what to do yeah Oh Oh God
Oh
I'm going to Hey yep right because I
minimize the game really really yeah by
the way that's it I don't hear it
anymore moans yeah it's the game I was
playing around this flank an hour and a
half before you showed up on that before
you show up for I even started streaming
so it's the shocking rich the what's
going on with this game I don't know
there I'm turning you up
really
how does Jack soundcheck actually we
should talk talk now Jack sounds weird I
I think I think we might be having more
mumble issues maybe we should try Skype
again oh all right I'm gonna I'm gonna
turn mumble off and I will see closer
just call me at Skype okay
