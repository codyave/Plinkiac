there could be a huge way Elson oh there
is a huge delay look now yeah yeah huge
delay what what is it going on with
twitch they're changing a server or
something because Amazon bought twitch
yeah a while ago and now twitch is
switching over their servers to the
Amazon servers yeah and so we we have to
update our chatty which we use chatty to
keep track of your chat while we stream
and we have unfortunately with the
watcher beefcakes twitter is not
functional so some of the mods will have
to keep track of our subscribers and
also apparently there is a huge lag
between when we say stuff and when it
goes live so well ladies we're streaming

just just hideous just hideous that's

kind of cluttered mess but people seem
to be enjoying it everybody's playing it
purple space bazooka says hey guys would

a DVD boxset of the wire yeah sure why
not give me yeah no I don't want things

planning on skipping the division anyway
it does not look like our thing but if
you have extra ps4 games send them we're
always looking to be fair Dragon's Dogma
looks awful generic and while it is
awful generic it was still fun so fun
that's true you know what rich you're
right that's why you always even even if
you don't think it's gonna be your thing
you got to give it a chance if you don't
have to you should you don't have to
give it because then you're giving every
literally every everything everything a
chance all the time you'll you'll spend
24 hours a day the rest of your life
just playing random games you know 99%
of which you hate yep yeah but you gotta
give it a try
you gotta give it a try rich so you
don't always always gotta give it a try
would we be interested in 25 free copies
of the order 1886 yes we could find
really fun ways to destroy them yeah
actually we could do that we could we
could make a a weekly video series in
which every week for 25 weeks we find a
new way to destroy the order 1886 that's
not bad that's not bad
so if you have 25 copies of the order
1886 or just a copy that you're looking
to get destroyed in a special way send

west of Rose Ridge Mall Tamar I'm you
know I like the games I like I dislike
the games I dislike I and I cannot help
it you
the regu Altima was saying I'm not sure
which I like more when you guys dislike
a game that general audience is like
like alien or when you like a game that
general audience is dislike like
Firewatch dude general audiences dislike
Firewatch I think well sure we're split
on that but and I think everybody's foot
on our comments by the way the comments
on that episode are split 50/50 half the
people are like yeah I'm with Jack that
games really fun and half the people are
like with rich and saying what's wrong
with you Jack that game is bullshit half
50-50 split just like we are we are
representative of all the though
Internet
Jack and you just agree with my opinion
all the time please I will try just this
guy you know it's who always agree with
your opinion
don't don't about things you don't like
says favorite customer yeah that's good
advice
to be fair Jack got majority screen time
in that episode I don't think so well
it's about the time Asadi I try to make
it even in my editing and there's a guy
with a blood dripping from the tank he
says oh the door was I is that a lock
that one of the keys on the side I said
I'll uh I'll uh staring a barber man I
took at the keys and open the trunk and
that's when I found on the manor with a
hornet of his hand
oh no this car is that is a registered
or woody Roberts O'Connor the Cardinal
are you gonna take Oliver to this
amazing Sonny I never I wash my hands if
I have to go make up like a pasta I
could make a pasta my family people good
yes like I call it a copper pasta I make
little badges and a gooey just like a
mummy I don't go back on the pizza pie
it's nice you have to say oh sure Keith
I'll search the cast on you can examine
the trunk
you guys wanna I see the blood coming
out keep-keep gonna do something no I'm
from a pretty useless detective I'm I'm
more here just to really just to make
you I'm lucky a wingman some people be
like how's that Sonny Bonzo he's a great
detective
oh yeah that's all to work I just float
along with you really I'm just here to
be a bullet sponge or a red herring
everyone thinks I'm bad
you're writing the cream all the way to
the top that's what looking over this
scene in this rundown area of Lydon I
see officer Mario Gallucci and a goblin
it's trunk open great dr. Mario a nice
non stereotypical Italian name it's all
about knows it at all days I put the
like it's Saturday why are you a racist
step oh my god a racist stereotype you
will not need to use the word racist in
this game very positive message but it's
completely unrealistic we're talking
about the police can't we learn a lesson
from this game we don't need to use the
word racist again guy the victims guy
there's no obvious clues I suspect that
the murderer the murder was committed
elsewhere yeah looking trunk yes I'm
gonna get my kid fist oh yeah
open trunk get kid closed trunk use
powder on car wash open the kit first
open kid not that's right one finger
pointing at someone else is three
fingers pointing back at you
gainfully I apply the fingerprint powder
and not wig processing okay now with
probably this is this is fucking
fingerprint powder powder does that ever
come into use Tiberius Kirk says on the
compressor could be an impedance mitchum
mismatch the compressor is not sending
enough signal to match the zoom nice
yeah if I do it in this screen that
could be I try to I tried to fiddling
with a bunch of settings on the
compressor and it didn't seem to how I
work but I also tried like you know
turned phantom power off on the zoom
turn the compressor off on the channel
on the zoom and nothing really seemed to
be working I will figure it out and it
might just be a bum compressor
no actually the input gain is set to
negative input gain is set to negative
ten and if I turn it down anymore I'll
need to turn it up on the zoom and we
have the exact same problem that hiss is
just there can you write down the
license plate number California to be CW
- five six - B C W - five six California
and this is a green it's green with a
dead guy in it green car okay great
looks like he took a bullet the head
there are no other obvious wounds check
vitals um how's it phrased in the manual
like like oh yeah yeah yeah we we have
there is a very specific procedure but
first oh actually we have a couple tips
sorry I missed an anonymous earlier says
hey are you guys going to e3 this year
time to write you know what not only are
we not going to e3 we're probably not
gonna do a video or anything because
those are always it awful they're just
awful we sit in like for six hours and
watch all the conferences and it's
terrible time
thanks Tiberius Kirk I will read that
later also gruff McMillan area and now
for another gritty episode of prereq PD
starring rich Evans as sergeant Anthony
Bologna Bologna sergeant Anthony Bologna
known by the punks of Lytton as Tony
baloney
okay I like it I like a crop okay anyway
to the manual where I got to do to this
corpse I will tell you in a moment
we should do three games and start with
the letter e ah
III I'm not a terrible idea not a
terrible idea
oh I had a I have a fun idea maybe I
can't say soak up to you people but I'll
tell rich later you know what we'll give
a special advance to anybody who can
lip-read what what's the
you
okay
where the game go what here okay there
okay let's see here
oh that's right we are looking on Jack
has an idea it's a lot a baboon drive a
tank no I think we're wasting time the
karna is arriving Sonny oh well there's
no I felony arrest procedures the use of
firearms homicide investigation
okay I'm going to I'm gonna load a save
so we can do things we might oh all
right fine thanks what's a did you the
last one I have drive to the 160 West
something goddamnit a region that's fine
it's fine
West Rose
I say the racist things I up a bar but
yabba-doo it's uh yabba-dabba-doo okay
I'm gonna not help that's me I'm gonna
go to the front seat here smoke
cigarettes I'm gonna get drunk all right
they were caught up already that's where
you gonna scratch my balls okay so one
thing you should do is check for vital
signs once you get there okay
if doubtful treat the victim as alive
okay
check vital signs the man has no pulse
no breath shows no signs of having and
shows signs of having been dead for
several hours okay now we gather
evidence search the surrounding area
recognize out of place unusual or
damaged items take photos as soon as
possible
take photos yeah I take pictures of a
murder scene and return the camera to
the get dust for prints prior to
handling an object worth trying okay
collect appropriate samples Serge body
searching thoroughly I find it a quarter
of an envelope clutched in the victims
left hand powder envelope yep
yes carefully I have no word processing
that's right okay it's fucking worthless
why do I carry this shit with me so
sorry if I need powder I shouldn't use
cocaine because at least I can snort
that get some kind of fucking USANA then
you put the envelope in a bag gathered a
and the the envelope thing can you do
the thing get envelope
look at hand yeah why won't you let me
get the fucking envelope collect
appropriate samples I look at the blood
and I don't feel squeamish at all
because you're a man
damn straight news dropper I use the
eyedropper to draw up some of the
victim's blood nice turn the dropper to
the kit and add the vial of blood to my
inventory of evidence get note get
letter you already took it
good thing you can't get that you can't
get that rich no thank you what do I
have okay
can you put envelope in bag here open
victims hand is that something you can
say you have no reason to do that open
hand not sure what I'm not sure why you
would want to open the victims hand
because he has something in it
horrible dick I see what appears to be
powder burns around the wound indicating
the gun was very close to the victim's
head okay okay
get the fucking envelope you can't get
that
why not the good game we try to open
hand and it didn't work right just you
just said open hand use fingerprint use
powder on envelope let's try that again
why not use powder on envelope not work
process okay they say type exactly this
take envelope you can't get nothing okay
um you get the envelope in your next
location they're saying how stupid is
that
that's that's pretty stupid we should be
collecting that as evidence putting it
in the baggie
well you got the eyedropper right you
got the you took pictures Yeah right and
then we just call the corner there's a
dead person in the trunk
great all right plastic baggie there's
nothing I put the cam in the baggie they
use the camera well it's like you should
put it like put envelope in baggie just
in case
I don't know how I feel about the Chad
reading like guides and something's oh
is that what that's yeah hey hey Chad so
they can feel about that we don't have
tweezers because movies do urgent why is
this why is this better than point and
clicking because point and click it's
just that's fun I'm solving I'm solving
the puzzle here you have to use a
different part of your brain and it's
very yeah like like remember that that
puzzle with a locker finding the locker
combination
turnover card mm-hmm how do you do that
to point-and-click where you're we're
weird we're actually using your head to
do that not just clicking that thing
it'll something happens Oh what if I
turn the card over you have to use your
brain to think outside of the box and
that's what this has over a point and
click the the downside to games like
this is sometimes the logic is very yes
yes there is a downside yes I'll take
I'll take the pros with the cons I'm
with you I'm with you I'm with you I'm
going to assume that's all we can do
then probably safe yeah
oh sorry oh hey here comes the meat
wagon yeah but if the grocer by
assigning how's it with the person gonna
do that do another is really you gotta
send the vino-antica where is this body
I don't see nobody

the drunk of course where else would it
be
I've I've been drinking just get the
body out of the trunk I know I hate you
