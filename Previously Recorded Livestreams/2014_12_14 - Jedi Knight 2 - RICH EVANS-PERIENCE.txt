oh this time of fucked up all right we
need we need something else what do we
got
if I play XCOM we'll be up half the damn
night so I'm not playing X calm
but I will do
plan three
I would play TIE fighter but when I
actually did a test before the chap and
it did not want to run I'm try
reinstalling it or whatever I don't know
but dub
was working earlier just not today
I don't know what's wrong but figure it
out this game UNIX dark just II write
this up a bit no no writer that works
alright new game
all right Jedi Knights and I'm not
playing kotor I'm playing Jedi Knight to
deal with
ille that or don't
you
is that game too loud I think it's too
loud
I know I'm quiet I said I'd be quiet
oh yeah I should have never it's too
late now
I can't narrate this text yadda yadda
yadda you have to shoot it things
yada-yada up done
I love Jedi Knight - but Jedi Knight the
first one are actually technically the
second with dark forces - can i night
one that game really needs a update a
remastering I hope GOG does that one
Nexus pairing for final approach
whatever's causing those transmissions
it's not showing up on any of the
sensors this Imperial outpost looks as
abandoned as reported it's as dead as
the rest of Ketchum my Mothma must be
getting paranoid she never used to send
pros like us out on blue milk runs like
this Shh
little more ground damn it yet it might
get reference just talking about you we
have reference that I've been covering
information about your mission on
ketchup I hate it when you say troubling
we managed to decode a small fraction of
the transmission we intercepted out here
and well listen for yourselves I'm on my
own
we may have value but then I reborn one
the Valley of the Jedi reborn we believe
this transmission was intended for
garlic fire the suspected leader of the
remnant forces in that sector is
probably nothing more than a couple of
soldiers telling tales around the claw
lamp but as you are the only survivors
of the valley of the Jedi incident I
thought it only fair to warn you that
this mission may be more dangerous than
we originally anticipated your
objectives however remained the same
find out what you can clear out any
remnant forces you encounter and may the
force be with you
so much for the blue milk run run I
think I saw someone all right now let me
see if I can turn the sound down for me
at night it's really loud for me okay
well I got a second here well I'm
working on this to talk about this
series somebody mentioned you know I
mentioned Jedi Knight one needing an
update somebody mentioned you this game
does do thing what this game is that
holds up a lot better than Jedi Knight
one does but actually somebody is
actually working on an update for this
game because they they somewhat in the
last year - they've released the O which
I'm gonna find the keys to find keys
somebody is though doing a source
portion of this game where is
that's wrong
see
this baby sorry I'm figuring on my
controls is very important to me
that's the translation
yes my seven had an opening so I applied
a man should be a quiet last name
great
to close click redeem stare but alright
it's alright
what was that is someone there
blasters aren't going to do much good
against that I'll see if I can find a
way to get the door open
wait here Janne
I have over this rate the remnant
usually has pretty tight security
perimeter defenses online did that do it
no but you managed to get everyone's
attention whoops I love the way they
move back and forth keep you from
hitting them it's just the dumbest thing
but it's so effective miss anything
though no all right go back down
that's one way to do it
you guys want me to play some newer
games by nature cover our back I've been
wet dragon the chemo like tells you what
do you people want out of me
everything is a complaint missing
No
keep an eye out for those rebels how you
can make quite blank in the head he
takes it my boyfriend because I hit him
right in the fucking face he's not
wearing Army's wearing skin I think I
want to open everything well I am I am
now deal with it game I think this is a
primary control console I think I'll
hang out here a while and see what kind
of trouble I can cause you do that I'm
gonna shoot Thanks
so many things I have just forgotten
about this game nope nope came from
there
forgot to shoot
fuck you
I need to stop being an old man I used
to be good at game not good at game
anymore
things change caveman talk I do
oh wait I do have health keys outside -
maybe one second if folks one second
know that miles1 nobody is that here in
Kentucky yeah they're all right Begum
how much help back there yeah well fine
I got extra health
I remember you oh shit
why am i crap
you're not open that's fine
me the doors open so that's I remember
the frustrating thing this game is great
except for the first key level sirs
brutally awful obscured and puzzles that
I'm puzzles is just you don't know which
way you're supposed to go for sure and
I'm thinking I maybe should have blown
this thing up yeah oh I know I just
think down here I can get yes Kyle the
schematics show them the base is divided
into three sections
you can be the ski
disturbance was reported in seconds was
our servant might set up a security
system of lower level and learn Thailand
looks like an imperial code
square thing with a squiggly bob on the
side I need to remember this all right
it's working with a squiggly Bob
it's offline it's off like oh it's
offline it's offline ah stupid game
lease that's open now
oh god I suck so much what did that
happen
one that I start sucking so much
Jan I'm gonna need your help there's an
access terminal here but it's encoded
I'm on my way
that did it a little faster my strategy
of running towards you while shooting
worked for the record I have this game
lightly modded I'm using a different
strong silver skin looks a bit more
movie accurate with less dirty long
enough now to break that code lead the
way
way I'm burning through ammo I'm shocked
figured I'd running on empty by now just
going full auto
I've given up on finesse
Oh hurry up now this looks interesting
piece of cake that should get you where
you need to go I'm going to keep at this
and see what I can find out what the
door that opened a fine everything's
gonna be
there we go
well that just takes me up there I don't
want to go there I don't - definitely I
want to go up here am I gonna go back
down the hard way
oh that blows oh good
lately unhelpful
and there
all these comically inaccurate
oh that was joke
I found another code
just embarrassing myself in this game
anyone out there I'm gonna die because I
sucked so much weight on your fire
all right well shields that's something
all right was good I miss something up
