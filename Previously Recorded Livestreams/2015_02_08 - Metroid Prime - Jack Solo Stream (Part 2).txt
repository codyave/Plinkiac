what else are you going to talk about
what else happened this week we talked
about radio shack already I feel what
else you know what I can talk about you
know what I can talk about this weekend
was a heavy kids movie weekend as you
all know I have children and so you know
sometimes we want to move me sometimes
we don't this weekend we watched two
movies we've watched the boxtrolls and
the book of life and I was actually
pretty excited to see the boxtrolls
because I know it was nominated for Best
Animated Feature not like that matters
cuz I don't really care about awards but
I was definitely interested in seeing it
and I had also heard great things and it
is boxtrolls is very food at box feels
very good really fun
we are you there really fun little movie
stop motion claymation adorable style
really really adorable style fuck you
fuck you and it looks great and the
boxtrolls highly recommend did vaccinate
my kids god damn right I vaccinated my
kids facts and he's got damn kids I'll
start an ad campaign called don't be a
dick vaccinate your kids now boxtrolls
super cute super cute and super fun had
a really good time kids seem to enjoy it
a couple scary moments a couple like
really weird moments for it being a kids
movie you know specifically like I guess
you know what I'm gonna I want to throw
this out there I'm going to throw the
spoiler alert for boxtrolls if you if
you're interested boxtrolls don't listen
for the next couple minutes that I
suppose I the it there was a reveal
later on that the villain dumpy take
vaccinate your kids that's right the
villain is a cross dresser and so like
just very strange segments for for it
being a children's film but it's fine
and a really fun little movie the
boxtrolls a little light a little you
know like I we talked about this when I
when I talked about um big hero 6 you
know like definitely kind of
waivers on the size of just a kid's
movie but still very fun very fun a date
then we also saw the book of life I
don't know if you guys know anything
about that but it was produced by
guillermo del toro that's very exciting
as i generally enjoy at least his ideas
if not all of all of all of his movies
but produced by gamma overdose or has a
really interesting look to it it's it's
animated 3d animated and all of the
characters look as if they are kind of
marionettes they're like wooden puppet
look to them ah one of the gist dullest
stories are we getting the morph ball
already is this happening already it was
QE book of life or was it called no I
was because book of life book of light
looks really cute really cute but just
an incredibly dull and and needlessly
stretched out story there were
characters that had no place in the
story there was like love triangles on
top of personal issues there was like
inter there was a there was like modern
songs done in quasi mariachi style not
even mariachi said which is slightly
like Spanish style it was very
distracting I really did not like
overall I did not much care for a book
of life it was fine for a kids movie and
of course in typical kids movie faction
my kids loved it and I was like you want
to watch boxtrolls again and there's a
no it's why the book of life again I was
like get out of here with that but
that dash that's incredibly helpful good
there ah it was just like this crazy
complicated story there's crazy
complicated stories and four characters
that deserve no complication if that
makes any sense come on get out here I
can get serpentine they're real oh I
don't have my chai keep I keep trying to
charge up my blaster and I don't have it
I don't have my charge less oh there you
go can't take none of this Samus you
should see Paddington is batshit crazy
hahaha you hated pans lambarth you were
wrong slide down pan's labyrinth is
great you are dead wrong get out of here
with that
no it's uh yeah book of life polyus just
didn't didn't much care for it it was it
was too that was two kids movie II where
they didn't they weren't necessarily
paying attention to like pacing or
character development it was all just
you know what what ship can we get on
the screen now to keep the kids watching
gotta keep the kids interested looks
like it should be something right that's
fun can I jump no I can't jump great
what's the best TMNT incarnation
tellegen asked i really like the new
Nickelodeon show i'm going to say the
best TMNT incarnation is this new
Nickelodeon show it's it's fun it's
lights the the turtles are actually
different characters they look different
the animations a little a little long
but you know for the budget you know
like for example even though they live
in new york city new york city seems to
consist of one street and a population
of zero whenever they leave the sewers
but you know there's actual
characterization in it which is very fun
and finally someone gets splinter right
which is you know he's a real ninja
master i really really like the new
nickelodeon animated incarnation of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I don't you
know and and I guess I've never read the
original Turtles comic so I can't
comment if that's better or not
apologies if it is better twelve year
when Jack works for Nickelodeon now
isn't there there's like a Nickelodeon
animator that comes in here every once
in a while I want to say right see
cartoon network oh I can't do this yet
there's like a there's like a charge up
thing that you get later
remember that but I can't do it yet I
know that much Sarah there might be a
thing over here I mean there's that
obviously I remember what I have to do
is that true Nickelodeon TMNT is the
best thing a lethal ninja master yeah
splinter in the in the Nickelodeon
cartoon is is great
he actually you know and you know why
he's great cuz he does something like in
the movie or in the old cartoon he was
just there he didn't do anything and he
didn't do anything because they couldn't
figure out how to get his puppet to look
good um but here he does stuff he is
integral to the stories its sponsors
nice in the in the Nickelodeon cartoon
gotta go round all right a time and I
will remember to save here I remember if
I if you go through this area there was
that there's a tunnel that was like
there seems to be a hole over here
that's weird Oh over here so that's
where I'm going um Pete and Pete best
ever you know there was some good stuff
in Pete and Pete for when you're younger
for when you're younger the new team and
t is like Teen Titans yeah yeah little
the definitely you know they it's not
not quite aping off of anime but they're
taking some style elements from anime
exaggerating and I like that I I'm okay
with all of that and it's fun they keep
it fun I think that's important
it's weird that like a Kids program
would want to be fun I was out the other
day and we saw me and me and my my
six-year-old were out and he saw a DVD
cover of the Michael Bay ninja turtles
and and we're at a store and he as loud
as you can just goes you it's the ugly
Ninja Turtles like he's seen you know
advertisements for those ninja turtles
and all I can say is like why do they
look so ugly and I can't answer him it's
just like I have no idea why they look
so ugly and so he makes sure just to say
II as loud as again every time he sees
them because they look so ugly and I all
I can do is agree well that's all i can
do is agree with them they look ugly it
makes me proud it makes me very proud
okay come on get down there
my son is a episode yes I'm training I'm
training him to be a hipster I'm trying
to try to train him to have good taste
warrior
Boing see what's in here see if there's
like a save spot in here that's the
thing later I remember that you get like
a magnetic morph all right get out of
here
ya hear ok I got a game you know what
I'm gonna get out of here how about that
I'll just leave you guys just leave you
guys to it so anything over here
probably not just go up the thing you're
supposed to go thing just go up a thing
stop exploring just go over the thing
did I go to the Madison Wizarding World
shindig no I know the answer is no I did
I don't even know I also don't know what
that is so what's the manliest oom it
has something to do with Wizards I mean
I just have no idea what's going on
right now the Madison Wizarding World
something is what was asked of me we
sounds great whatever it is it's a world
of Wizarding wizards who is the
wonderful whiz boom boom boom comic-con
pretty much yeah that's what I thought
I never you know what I saw a couple
episodes of the Star Wars someone asked
if I yes I say yes because like I just
remembered like you can steam up your
visor and I think that's awesome someone
just asked if I ever watched the star
wars clone wars animated stuff and I saw
a couple episodes and I thought the
animation was so ugly that I couldn't
watch it I could not bear to watch it I
do I don't care if it's good it was so
ugly to look at that I just could not
stand it I just was right where am I
going
came from there so I'm going this way so
I need to turn the left okay now going
this way I really really like it I
thought all the robots looks great but
all everyone that was humanoid-looking
so what am I playing metroid prime on

game to you but I'm playing with my wave

right up to the microphone so you guys

ah for anyone wanting to know I'm having
a beautiful and wonderful ballast point
sculpin India Pale Ale the most
beautiful and perfect I PA ever made so
smooth so wonderful if you can get
yourself a ballast point sculpin it's
really an incredibly smooth slightly
fruity IPA just it's it's it's a joy and
the more and more I drink them more I
really really like IPAs especially if
they're like this okay so I can't go
through the heat so I have to find i
guess i have to go back up here
you
wait wait and wait wait I come down on
this I probably did did I come down on
this ballast makes grapefruit sculpin
Elvis Elvis is right ballast makes a
grapefruit sculpin IPA which actually I
did not like as much as regular sculpt
and the grapefruit sculpin almost hate
and like it had it had like rind like a
like a tart grapefruit rind taste to it
which I did not like as much it's gotta
be this one then right I thought I hated
him I it's I must have missed something
in this room so I even though I'm a huge
fan of grapefruit in general ah there we
go there we go needed to get to okay
anyway I figure I figured it up sculpin
does make the grapefruit sculpin ballast
point makes the grapefruit sculpin but i
just did not dig it as much here we go

the center room well metal gates i'ma

chosen to leave it behind on this
journey our home be around a land for
will be a place of simplicity structure
hewn from the stone bridges woven with
branches always corrects my pure waters
we build around the ancient & noble tree
trying from the strength and giving them
our own and return oh and his wild will
flow around us here our race will just
be one more group of creatures in the
dead of nature it is our hope that such
a state will bring with it a great
wisdom a greater understanding of the
nature of the universe once our city is
here complete we will appear in word and
discover the truth
that's not what I wanted to do ok here

figuring it out sooner all right here we
go so what's going on dig up stupid
right oxygen you talking about H point
265 I'm so excited about that but that
was announced like three years ago and
they still haven't delivered we're all
totally stuck in H point to 64
which is fine it's a fight that's a fine
code act and now with with more html5 we
should be seeing that was kind of dumb
an appreciative no structural weakness
detected in metalwork that's your
scanning the new chose allure and tree
has been downloaded to your book as we
struggle with the great poison something
stirs at the edge of our vision it is in
the hatchling sabes we feel her across
the void as she hunts the corrupted will
our fates again be one as our pride
chatters will prophesy become real when
all strength wanes from chozo will it be
the hatch league who fulfills our legacy
true sight eludes us for the poison
gnaws at all vision leaving Sears wide
and filled with despair truth blessings
baked up later funny voices for the wind
be like this yeah I I like to picture
that the chozo as nerds because they are
there technologically advanced there's
nerds I probably can't step in that goo
it's my guess
so I'm not killing those things because
they're giving me light and I want that
light so i won't step in the goo there
we go here we go great yeah I hear boom

think about Fred Durst is I don't care
where was the other missile thing is it
this way not this way there's another
missile thingy okay you know was the
last time you thought about I think of
another schmuck I guess I think he's a
schmuck you know he did it all for the
nookie and so I'm not going to blame him

anyone for their own cookie habits that
