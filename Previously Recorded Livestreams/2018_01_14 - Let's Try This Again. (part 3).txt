well we we dumb for like a couple more
oh yeah okay okay
oh yeah we're down for a couple more
Jack actually kicked some ass I did
pretty well this round I think I got
four kills that round that was pretty
good that's pretty good I'll take it oh
my hands got a little a little sweaty
I'm gonna I'm gonna take a bathroom
break you take a bathroom break oh man
dyno steps get some water okay did I
miss anything tip wise while I had my
headphones oh you touched a bit on
Raymond but Raymond legend specifically
is the one they brought up sure well and
you know Rayman Origins I think it was a
return to that like excellent platformer
I'd put that up there with like super
meatboy level platformer
where it was just so tight that what the
levels were incredibly fun they had this
great like chase the treasure chest
thing where you had to do things like
super fast and be super precise but
during the normal levels you could just
jump around and have fun it also had a
great co-op for kids okay because if
it's co-op and someone like falls and
dies then they just float in a bubble
and you can go get them and Mario they
do the Mario thing I think actually they
might have done it before Mario oh
really
I don't know do okay I remember I
remember playing that with my kid when
they were a lot younger and they they
always enjoyed that playing that with me
so I never played legends but origins
was super fun someone on the chat wants
to know how they beat the chef in Dead
Rising 2 been a while since I had a full
playthrough of Dead Rising 2 but if
memory serves the boxing the the boxing
glove knives combo is fairly effective
you Wolverine his ass that and just
learning his pattern it's a combination
um this time it's lupus is hey guys left
playing with you last week glad you
enjoyed it so this is Jack love to do it
again but if you want to give others a
shot that's cool
my birthday is Tuesday as a present can
we get some Don Wilson action I don't
know if I'm in the right headspace for
that no I'm Wilson I can do that I'm
doggone I play this game where you shoot
people you run around look for this
circle right right oh oh don't stay too
far out of the circle you'll die got
this great idea we read beans in the
game but you got to keep reading beans
better than the circle
uh-uh crazy mate 999 says yes people
cheer during movies watching Fast Five
when the chips are down and Vindi screw
is all about to quit then the rock says
I'm in and the crowd went fucking nuts
and to be honest I got into it - all
right budget Messiah says hey guys have
you gotten a chance to see the new
season of Netflix Black Mirror
I've not sorry I'm not I'm sorry if so
what was your favorite episode and why
was it metalhead also same question but
for Amazons electric dreams I'm
unfamiliar with this Amazon show
electric dreams I'm unfamiliar with the
80s movie about the computer that gained
sentience after our man spills wine and
his deboard and then the computer falls
in love with his girlfriend and tries to
kill the guy but I doubt it's a Amazon
show based on that call
parley says hijack and rich or called
Perry just donating a few shekels for
providing me with hours of entertainment
and fun moved away from my home in the
UK to Canada and you've helped a lot
through this keep doing what you do will

like it's picked through but I mean
there could be something in it yeah I
think supply wise I think I'm decent
Reese

building directly east they just jumped
out of the second floor a lot I might be
able to hit them if they start running
and which building the small one no no
they're in the tree the the red roof
tree what's the rush they were over
there they were they were east and
they're not East anniversary shit except
for there they're shooting them now I
got someone a couple times
guy that just shot is gonna be close to
this red building
see anything out there no just that guy
he's staying hidden behind his tree
because I headshot
shit do they see us that guy was on the
hill at 1:15 okay okay what's his aim

what I killed some decent people that
killed a decent number of people all
right Kyle it's up to you no I did
terrible I couldn't hit shit I'm
completely useless when I play this game
I I don't know why I don't know why I
can't hit anything in this game I think
I get too nervous well and sometimes you
know because there is server lag every
once in while you need to adjust where
it's like shoot a little bit in front of
them to deal with server lag yeah it's
just like you're not just aiming for
them you want to even a little bit in
front of them and yeah Bruce and I
killed by the blue circle but hey we
made a pretty Dern far I'm pretty proud
of us rich yep and we were in it we were
in it this time we got our hands dirty
we fought at the mansion that was
awesome it's my mouse sensivity it might
be mm-hmm it might be too high I'm sure
I'm sure
well yeah and then you just get so
nervous yeah blood gets pumping you're
like yeah yeah yeah I know I love it
that's like that to me gal you great
though go you're great Oh Kyle's on top
of it I mean you know thanks for leaving
us behind but hey you know he made the
right decision we were dead weight we
were but like that's the that's the
exciting part about this game that's
what makes me excited about playing this
game in general is those moments where
your blood gets rushing it's very real
it's very visceral
Oh crazy crazy oh he thinks he can hide
in a bush is that what he thinks he
could hide in a bush mad Bush strats oh
nice girl those book that Bush ain't
gonna save you Sun bushes are for ivy
have you abandoned the bush Sarah bushes
are great for hiding but as soon as
someone shoots at you and a bush you
gotta run the fuck out of there right
there's no cover in bushes oh my god
through the trees through the brush Kyle
you're mad man
right there's three people there's three
people out there somewhere hopefully
they're not on the same team right son
of a bitch son of a bitch you can do it

in a tower what do you wanna do what's
going after oh we don't know what's
going on oh great we're in the circle I
think we're we're kind of chill right
now honestly yeah
yeah that is true we are kind of chill
unless somebody wants to get on the move
you know I I have plenty of like
bandages the first-aid kit but I could
use like some energy drinks or something
like that we could go to the original
plan and like see what's on the other
side of this mountain cuz if people
aren't probably over there but if the
circle closes up the mountain right now
we have the fucking high ground and you
know I loves me some high ground well
what does everyone thinking what is this
I guess we're all kind of doo doo doo
doo doo oh you guys are leaving are you
leaving I don't know
nobody's said anything about leaving I
think because of the what what's the
complaint says that North would be good
right I have a suggestion we go to North
that's what I'm hearing
okay let's do it ride north we're
heading north it's fucking rocket
towards that orange marker sounds good
okay from that socket there was a
motorcycle but those things are a
deathtrap

motorcycle very much yeah that's not
being motorcycles I'm rich and I had a
very bad experience recently with the
motorcycle

round building funky round build and

in this so it seems like incredibly
difficult shots I don't believe there is
any sort of auto America there are
people who use cheats to auto aim but I
don't want to I don't want to make it no
that seems like just people who are
insanely good at this game yeah that's
just good old-fashioned I'm good at a
sniper yep yeah we should report him we
should definitely report me right
basically what I'm saying is we should
definitely report them
