Power Stone X button do X's punch is
jump you want to get all the power
stones so you get Jessi awfully
powerful okay unless you have you can't
oh you can but they help tremendously
okay so is jump X is punch y is kick and
B is pick up stuff okay and I'm assuming
there's combinations you can do yeah and
then when you pick something up you
press the X button to throw it okay X is
useful I may not be as useful for
picking things up like they'll be guns
lying around you can pick up a gun and
fire a gun so keep keep being mud

where two people hey fuck we're not in
the scene we're doing something funny
it's like oh I do all this can I are
BFFs so we can just do a thing that's
yeah
so sorry if that was a disappointing
story but that's all we got now we're
chocked full of disappointment.
Jay: Ever plan on, I think we answered this last week, ever plan on doing a live Best of the Worst. No. There's a reason that editing exists, and editing is what makes those, those episodes.
Jack: Yes.
Jessi: Yes.
Jay: We cut out all the boring stuff, and there's a lot of it.
Jessi: Yeah.
