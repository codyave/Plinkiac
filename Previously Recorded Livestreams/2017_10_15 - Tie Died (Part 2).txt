all right let's see what we got he had a
little bit a bit of an urban crisis has
any tips for a brand new player of
stardew valley I got the game for the
switch for the portability I hit summer
and all I've done is clear the debris
and grew and sold potatoes
no one danced with me at the festival on
the first festival you're not gonna get
something it's just not good that's a
really tough thing to get someone to
dance with you of that first sure
there's some jackass who's done it of
course like a speedrun you had to be
able to give something somebody
something they loved every possible day
you can give them something they love
that still might not be enough and if
you probably have to do like a birthday
gift to say have to find something
there's a birthday before the dance but
yeah yeah I'm sure it's possible the the
only tip I have the thing that has made
this playthrough a positive st. check
our Jason preference all right the thing
that has made this playthrough a
positive for me unlike but you know my
first playthrough wasn't it necessarily
negative I just thought it was kind of
boring is having a goal in mind
reference and oh it's at the counselor
actually no okay I I got to a point
where I didn't really want to place
Jason right right okay well there you go
and so you know having a goal in mind is
really important and so if your goal is
to be friends with everyone and have a
wife like you just want someone to dance
with you at next Springs Festival then
you know you go to the stardew valley
wiki and you start learning you know
stalk people and see what they like and
your start working towards what they
like but also just take your time and
explore go to the mud go do all the shit
but the mind don't don't obsess over if
you want to enjoy starter Valley yeah
you don't have to obsess about
accent right you really don't need to go
to the wiki what is the absolute most
favorite thing that person like give
something they like and eventually their
affection will you would take your time
it's not stardew valley I mean you could
play it that way if you want but it
doesn't have to be a sprint it's a
playground yeah
you'll get there and you don't have the
whole point the whole point to me for me
is you don't have to stress out about it
yeah it's it's not supposed to be like
that you can't die in stardew valley you
can't go to the poorhouse and start a
valley and like no matter what your farm
is gonna be there you know take it take
it day by day but but also I do think
it's very important to have some sort of
goal in mind and even if your goal is as
simple as I want a farm that's full of
crops you know like you just need to
start learning how to plant and then you
talk to people learn
it's the journey not the destination so
your argument is mass effect was good
because stardew valley I'm not sure how
this really applies stardew valley isn't
a narrative it's a sandbox that's it
that's the thing that's right start your
start to Valley is a great exam I think
it's poking at me oh and I think I read
that as a poke at me oh no I think
that's just a general saying that people
because with stories I think that the
destination is very very important
hahaha not sure and we've we've had
arguments on stream about that so I just
assume oh I presume that was poking at
me we have talked in general about the
journey being being a part of that but
uh battery hello battery I suppose we've
talked about that before I started
Valley is a great example of why the
journey is so important I think yeah the
journey isn't worthless uh-huh but when
you're talking about a narrative
leanness I think I think the destination
is the most important piece I want a
good resolution to that journey of
course
yeah the journey should be good too but
I'm putting more weight on that
destination
but so basically we just threw a lot of
out at you about stardew valley but i
think the most important thing is to
take your time just feel it out don't
worry about the you know what if you
missed the first dance you didn't get
some there's infinite dances because
every spring this is gonna be that dance
yep
and even even playing fairly casually
just fairly casually you will have
somebody who likes you enough by the
second dance to dance with you yeah oh
yeah I am
and you know let's just spend some days
walking around town talking to people
seeing what the like the batteries
already installed in the other car Jason
doesn't have shift yet chat but he can
teleport similar but different
like that
thank you walking into a dead end I am
it's okay I have a pocket knife and I
have a pan Oh
like to see somebody try and jump
through a window but just bonk their
head in the glass and fall on the ground
yes like that like a 1 in a 1 in 20
chance that the glass won't break right
I'm down dong
Jason's fucking around with other people
right now hey hey no hang with you know
the four seater I'm done with that how
we in touch
don't hit me them oh yeah you know we're
behind
we're behind like I know even to just to
go back to start to Valley for a second
yeah I know even in my current
playthrough like I I do have like
general goals and whatnot but some some
days like instead of like min maxing and
saying like fuck it I have two hours
left so I'm gonna go to the mines really
quick and just you know get all the
jewels I can for two hours and then
maybe I have time to catch three fish so
I can get 200 extra dogs I'll just spend
a day and walk around town looking for
worms yeah you know like those little
warm ease that pop up and you know
there's stuff on it you know look
through people's garbage of course and
just like spend a day walking around
town it's a nice town spend a day
fishing fuck it
completely worthless at this point
so we way way behind them yeah we've
been talking about shit the last one I
remember reading here is done blink got
a running gag know start with those
there's a starter Valley
I don't remember Zelda question what I
got a Zelda question here that I don't
remember that well then read then Verdun
2772 says I lied about my last tip being
my last Zelda question okay how would
you guys feel if in a follow-up they
kept the open world but added a link to
the style dark world easy way to devil
map size like re-exploring shit I don't
know I don't know but you'd be reacts
flowing stuff but it's a different color
now no no no that would you know what
that would feel cheap that would be
cheap
I would not be into that where did
fuckin swimsuit take that gasps mm-hmm I
think I don't know if there's much that
can like convinced me to pick up breath
of the wild again I I had a great time
exploring oh hello well there's gonna be
that one new dungeon yeah I'm curious to
see that oh I don't have walkie-talkie
Valiant oh you might have read this I'm
not sure valiant bloodshot's us rich I
saw the new Blade Runner and it's a
masterpiece oh yeah but if you hate the
first one you'll hate this one it's long
slow sorry I must have just skimmed over
that Zelda one then and could be dull to
average film goers watching your own
risk I don't I don't think song or slow
movies necessarily have to be bad I like
Star Trek the motion picture I just
think the Blade Runner specifically is
dull Star Trek the motion picture is
pretty damn slow
oh fuck
tree oh yeah and you read this new
certainly one oh I must have then we
just missed that one yes that one Zelda
one sorry happens this time it's lupus
says hey rich the Packers lose and Aaron
Rodgers is out for the rest of the year
what
and the Bears win led by their rookie
quarterback in an overtime upset tell
Mike we here in Chicago say hi well
Aaron Rodgers got it he's out for the
year huh oh wow I hope that's true
oh shit did they get out to fuck with
people around here gonna do on Sunday
right
oh I'm yeah completely the wrong exit oh
oh
ooh well this could be good so Jason's
by the car and everyone's by the car and
it has all with shit but oh my god I'm
way over here
look I'm at the I'm on the wrong end of
the map I was been going the wrong way
this whole time damn hippie why does
your one spray if to what do you have a
double healing perk I just was carrying
two sprays apparently I didn't know you
could do that well I know there's a perk
that does that unless they added some
kind of new spray bottle no I don't know
you're so not getting in that car unless
Jason can kill off a few more people
Nana wants to know if there's a Diddy
Kong status update oh I kind of forgot
about that okay we forgot about that
sonic mousetrap says Aquaman and Cyborg
can't support solo movies even though I
like cyborg it's too terrible characters
to put in the movie universe Warner
Brothers has no idea what it's doing
here's the thing though I think most
people maybe not maybe not some hardcore
comic book fans most people would have
said the same fucking thing about
Ironman or Thor I'm sure I'm sure there
are people on record saying that who's
gonna care about Ironman guardians of
the galaxy
who gives who's gonna give a fuck about
car I never heard of guardians it with a
fuck of it right it's not it's not the
base character it's who makes the movie
I think the problem is DC is not gonna
hire high
I can - thank you
I got in good work jack
I feel pretty good about that but can
you get out
I got a pan I got a pan so if Jason
stops us I got a pan oh and out smaller
ma'am
boom congratulations congratulations
feel pretty good about that I feel
pretty good about that
I survived there no through no action on
your own part I got to the car you
survived on the kindness of strangers I
made it to the car you're welcome I like
the guy who plays Aquaman he was all
right it's the only other thing I've
seen him actin was gameofthrones he
played called Drago he he basically
played like a big idiot who grunts and
is his whole character was that he was
big and strong and didn't say much
that's all I've ever seen him actin so I
cannot say for sure whether or not he is
a good actor
why beat says debris Deb raid you put
all these fancy one lonesome type of
things I still don't know how you
pronounce it properly it's spelled like
the Brits but apparently it's supposed
to be SF debris the guy who does the
comic book the history of comic books
and their writers which is a fantastic
Internet video series noun noun
scattered pieces of waster remains tired
of hearing you mispronounce this looks
like the Brits debris is debris it looks
like the Brits and so I'm gonna just you
know the English language is fucked up
man
valiant bloodshot your chances of that
are zero Mike being on a stream Oh zero
like zero true-blue reviews is thanks
for suggesting happy deathday for me to
watch on my birthday last Friday it was
way more entertaining than I thought it
would be and if Rotten Tomatoes is to be
believed it was better than the
foreigner right it looked like a fun
premise for a horror movie yeah happy
deathday like the groundhogs they have
horror movies yeah yeah they go contra
mundis says the feeders clips that are
elem showed really reminded me of things
yes yes why is feeders worse than things
if you could explain and yes I have
things seeing things in its entirety
twice I hate things I absolutely I know
I'm you know you hate things okay Mike
and Jay love things I absolutely fucking
despise things yeah yes I hate things
the but do you like feeders no no and
like I said there there therein lies the
difference the things looks to be shot
on film the feeders is a shot on VHS you
know D it feeders has that DIY
filmmaking element whereas things almost
feels like a quasi real production I
would not want to watch I would not want
to watch either again but you want to
treasure it remember always say hey this
is a thing that existed and I believe
it's part of the pot that has led to our
current state of filmmaking yes you're
gonna appreciate this one a part it says
Hagen I also wanted to say that your
reference to end
it was great than the last best of the
worst thanks for putting something
pointless but still hilarious
we made J do that we were just out of
nowhere we started humming the anticodon
i got the thing on my shoulder or just
trotting along the woods yeah and then
and you know JJ was film when I said
there was and and we found a spot I was
like Jay I want to do the I want to do
the I pick up something and throw it
like like oh he doesn't taste like and I
was like we're we're doing this you can
cut it out but you have to film it and
he use it I'm really happy that he
Fenton that he used it but we are caught
up but if you watch the last plane keto
episode
it ends with rich and I walking through
the woods and I did a little homage to
The Andy Griffith Show did you even have
an actual rock or was that all just
pantomime I found a small small stick I
could not find a rock but I I did a
little thing where I picked up a stick
and threw it like Obie did yeah yeah in
the intro to The Andy Griffith Show I'm
going to take a break
rich is gonna take a break we're just
watching scape ghosts about to get
murdered
someone should have thrown a crappy
alien puppet when when you finished
bearing the tape that's actually I want
to say like that's what rich said is as
we were walking back rich that this is
this reminds me of back in the day
filming because everyone like when
you're making your first movie everyone
does it in the woods because it's a free
location and everyone shoots their early
movie in the woods and so it did it feel
incredibly like the early days of making
shitty movies which is you know it's
that's where we all came from and that's
kind of again that's it's a nice thing
about feeders like I remember I remember
doing that making really shitty rubber
puppets and I'm making a dumb movie
so I mean let's just all of us I'm still
working on trying to find the original
tapes for like one of one of the for a
very early movie that I made with my
cousin and we're trying to I I have I
have it on DVD way back in the day I
shot a short and a little movie it's
like a 20 minute movie mostly out in the
woods and I have it on DVD but I would
love to get the original DV tapes and do
a quick read of it switching up some
some copy written music and put that out
there just as a fun editing exercise but
as of right now we can't find the
original DV tapes there somewhere well
Raquel I'm trying to yeah I'm we are
trying to find the original DV tape so I
can re-edit it and remove all of the the
copy written music it's a great it was a
great little comedy horror movie calls
and not quite Dead Yet
I mean obviously a great yeah digital
video tape DV tape digital video tape
it has it has quite possibly one of the
best scenes I've ever ever written and
not quite Dead Yet and I'm excited for
people to see it that's it that's it
terrorists I'm not quite dead dot dot
dot yet but I have a working DV deck
that I can use to import all of the all
of the footage this was pre bald Jack I
even think I had a small beard at that
point so but this is balding Jack like
it was going but I had hair yeah this I
didn't it wasn't full beard Jack I have
found some great pictures of full beard
to Jack
but this wasn't full beard Jack this was
slight beard Jack this was like college
freshman beard Jack good days I'm not
quite not quite Dead Yet I'm just
chatting with people I was telling I was
talking about this movie that I made a
while ago I don't know if you if you
ever saw one
it's called not quite dead now dot dot
dot yet it's a it's a comedy horror
movie shot mostly out in the woods
because that's where everyone shoots
their movies well that's it well that's
what I'm saying actually like I'm
working right now with
makes me wonder if they working I'm
working with my cousin right now to try
to find the original DV tape so I can
re-edit and upload it to YouTube but as
some of the line what line you say you
said not quite you said as this person's
not dead yet huh I said not quite knock
that oh my god I don't know I didn't
know what you're talking about that's
just coincidence exactly so I'm hoping
I'm hoping to get the tapes soon so I
can get that up as a fun little rewind I
was I was telling him it has one of I
and I can't describe it I don't want to
describe the scene because even in
describing it you'll be disappointed in
seeing it but it has one of the what I
think to be one of the greatest things
I've ever written than one of the
greatest sequences I've ever written is
it not quite Dead Yet all right
Elaine says you Lane I noticed you guys
have a commentary track for Row 1 my
question is yes should I watch it first
before the commentary or just go ahead
with you lovelies whispering in my ear
in general good question with a
commentary track I think it's usually
wise to watch the movie or show or
whatever it is first yeah but I know a
lot of times we veer off topic how ranty
are we in that I don't even remember did
you listen to it probably not I haven't
listened to yeah yeah I didn't think so
I'm sorry I hear you guys talk a lot as
is in general yes watch watch a movie
first and then re watch it with the
commentary track that is the the rule of
thumb unless you just don't give a shit
about Star Wars you haven't seen road
one yet presumably you just don't give a
shit but I even like even if you don't
give a shit about Star Wars you should
see the movie first so then when you
guys are talking about something you
have a frame of reference okay
or else what you're dealing with is too
many inputs and so you might miss jokes
you might miss references yeah watch it
watch rogue one first that's probably
the same thing yeah
unless you get too bored ah it's great
you only refer to the movie about 10
times do you guys just start talking
about others shit we usually do a
commentary tricks
it happens more often than not that's
great rogue one is a slog mall rat call
it's an absolute slog
I don't know if I would be much helpful
on a commentary track Jack trigger
choice cuz I would get off-topic I think
that's what usually happens like when
the four of us are together we just
start talking about random shit
I would not be helpful somebody was
trying to avoid the last Jedi spoilers
wants to know if they should watch the
latest nerd crew probably not unless you
could skip to like halfway through when
we stop talking about that I'm trying to
think we stop talking about the trailer
right but then you kind of come back to
it don't you we start talking about the
Justice League yeah but I thought you
coming back to Star Wars
did we I don't I don't know just don't
watch it them I don't think the
existence of a pork is a spoiler oh we
knew about porks before the trailer yeah
hordes were all the hotness and I got to
tell you people they're on the money
with this whole pork situation because
like I had to go to the toy store with
my kids the other day and they saw the
porks and freaked the fuck out they
needed the pork right away risk so weird
they needed it they need and they have
not seen the trailer they don't know
that it's Star Wars related they just
saw a pork muster saw something
somewhere as far as I know they do
subconsciously even they had calling it
they have not seen the trailer yet and
so they just saw the adorable pork the
adorable portable and and freaked out
and needed it and no we don't need any
pork it's genetically engineered
someone's about a boat already well you
got in the boat dog what are you putting
on the boat
what's she doing what's she doing over
there done valiant bloodshot I'm gonna
read this but the admit you already
where'd he talked about it you must have
missed it this is Jack I just saw a
trailer for a new x-men film called the
New Mutants New Mutants apparently it's
not an action film it's a horror film
set in a mental hospital and actually
looks kind of interesting yes it does
it unfortunate like wow it does look
interesting and I really liked the idea
of like people not understanding that
they have abilities and confusing them
for psychological problems which could
make for a very visually distinct horror
movie the oh hell no okay I know why but
does this have to tie in with the x-men
movies I don't know if it officially
does shit worse
does this have to be tied in with the
x-men franchise I mean yeah right I know
the answer is comic book movies make
money I know that I know that whoever
put the gas in the boat
do you see me cuz I'm about to get the
fuck out of Dodge
sorry person who put the gas in the boat
I'm leaving
will karma catch up with Jack sorry not
sorry
karma doesn't sound like it's catching
up with Jack Jack is a horrible person
and should feel ashamed but he's alive
which is probably more than the person
who put the gas in the boat can say I
made it
no that's Jack with the boat that is the
proper course of action quarters you did
right you did the right thing and you
know what I hung around for long enough
so like Vic should have been able to
they should have been able to oh is he
coming back to the boat now oh no he's
at a different dog they should have been
able to see me on their map heading
towards the boat and that's the that's
what you got to do you got to keep an
eye on the boat
and and your Tommy and I'm Tommy
you know what I've done sometimes with
the boat I find like the propeller but I
don't know where gas is yet I will just
put the propeller down somewhere on the
ground outside near the boat but not too
close to the boat I'll hide it behind a
rock you know and I don't feel bad about
this you got to say you got to think
about you in these situations how does
this affect me
okay so New Mutants here's here's some
quick New Mutants talk I really like the
idea of confusing mutant to psychic
abilities with mental illness but that
is something that Legion does very well
the FX show another box
yeah property another Fox x-men property
Legion does that really really well
and so I've worried that New Mutants is
just going to reuse a bunch of the same
stick okay I really love the actress
who's playing magic she was in she was
the star of the Vova CH and split and
she is fan-fucking-tastic
and you know it might be good to see a
horror movie so with a mutants oh hello
you know you want to think my biggest
issue with the swimsuits is what it's a
Friday the 13th movie they would be
skinny-dipping I mean you're not right
when when you can't when can we get the
dong VLC flap and dongs and then you
could have it you could have like a
helicopter dance that distracts Jason
let it fly bloodshot says guys I
expressed my distaste for the porks
online and all my friends hated what I
had to say I called it shameless
merchandising everyone called me a
cynical asshole what is wrong with the
world people star wars i love star wars
star wars star wars star wars just don't
think about it too much go on with your
life yep okay so for those who didn't
who don't know what just happened the
car was full I was in the car and
someone came into the car and I gave up
my car seat Wow because I already
escaped once and I kind of escaped in a
dickish way so that's how I made up for
it that's how I made up for that was my
karma karma has been restored everybody
even restores Karma's been restored it's
okay and the police are coming anyway
and so I'm probably gonna get out no
matter what and it's Jason even trying
there's Jason i Whittle that's what they
just wondered if Jason was afk find a
cab and shoot him in the face
by the church in this map it's either
under I mean I Tommy I know it's not on
the island cuz the fire is there yeah
now I'm sorry it's by the under the the
graveyard oh oh oh you know that's that
ways kind of towards the police anyway
so I'll hit that way who else is around
I don't know I don't oh yeah wait
there's a company you know what I'll go
see those other people there might be
them by the exit though sometimes they
still show up on the radar
no no that's different people I'll go
help them out I'll see if they need any
help I'm right by the cops
we'll see if these people need any help
I'll be helpful Tommy Jarvis actually I
wonder are they are they afk as well
I wonder mm-hmm where they at
specifically no no they're just that in
that general direction they got out no
no they're outside of the bounds oh god
damn it so now I'm just holding up the
game
yes you are
Press TV for me
sorry everyone I saw your icons on the
map and I thought I could save more
people but it's just a glitch I'm
getting out now use mute players to find
out who is still alive since the update
yeah but you can see on your map there's
no there's no players at map but if you
look at like if you look on the map on
the on the lower left corner do you see
those circles they're out so those are
the people who escaped in the car and I
kept thinking that they were alive
people and I would be helpful Tommy
Jarvis button can they hear that they
can hear that if they're spectating jack
yeah and since he's the only one alive
that's likely yeah
can the police get killed by Jason to
the police don't even come into the they
can stun Jason then just show up by one
of the exits and that that just means
you can leave right
they son Jason if it gets too close but
she's not actually crowded lying safe
this is a good drawing go put it on the
fridge that they take it down when the
kid leaves the kitchen it's that type of
brown yeah this was a bad Jason or
possibly Jason that wasn't away from the
keyboard yeah away from keyboard that
foot afk means well a little song about
afk right there not to be confused with
former President John F Kennedy that's
JFK
what a upcoming games are you guys
excited for what's upcoming oh yeah
Mario coming up I'm excited about the
new Mario that's super duper excited but
why on the radar I have no I have no
strong feelings about the new Mario yeah
i i'm not hyped i'd I'm not like yeah I
don't I'm not seeing it everywhere and
I'm so I'm not overhyped or underhyped
or anything I'm just like I feel nothing
for the new Mario okay so zero hype for
destiny - I thought that was already out
that is already out okay this is destiny
- when nine days hype I thought it was
out already
oh maybe like is it out on ps4 when it
comes to PC I don't know
we'll finish time - yeah sure I gotta
actually gonna get myself to play - the
first one
ah the PC releases in nine days is what
they're saying gotcha okay great
I do feel about doing the Mario the the
Mario dance is actually pretty shitty
it's like swing your arms from side to
side that's how you go you go and do the
mario then you put one foot in front of
the other like the mario dance is like
running in place that's what the mario
dances that's the doing the mario i feel
poorly about it it's so it's it's the
worst it's like it's a bad dance and
it's a bad song
swing your arms from side to side let's
go and do do do the mario then you put
one foot in front of the other
it had to be easy enough for captain Lu
to do it that's probably true
yeah good old captain Lu what's on my
head today I think I'm wearing the court
normal Illinois Corn Belt arrggh cap
that's what it looks like yeah you have
a corn on your head
rich there they're an independent league
baseball team normal Illinois Corn Belt
arrggh Normal Illinois
that's beautiful the normal corns rich
has got the normal corns I love it how
bad at bat bat barrel I'm loving it and
I said I've never actually read any of
the Conan stories I'm familiar with them
like the character so I don't know why I
haven't how are you are you like just
being a reader in general not really
yeah I thought I remembered knowing that
about you what about I like a book on
tape like I like an audiobook yeah yeah
not our body oh but sometimes I'm doing
something else hmm I know you like the
document oh well oh yeah you like the
documentaries yeah
got the battery so perhaps you would
like like a true a true to life book on
tape you know like out like a biography
like you ever read well no cuz you're
not a reader like every like Theodore
Rex no Theodore right you know it's
about Theodore Roosevelt and it's a
fucking there's nothing you know what
the Whoopi Goldberg movie oh yeah it's
just a ripper of a biography cuz like
Roosevelt was a badass shit someone the
chats making a joke about Cohen reading
to me at night here's the thing Karen
likes reading today if we run like a
trip or something I'm driving she's in
the passenger seat she'll read a book
aloud first of all to enjoy so someone
is giving you hell because someone you
care about reads into you that might not
have known that oh sure oh come on I got
the battery in that wasn't a joke don't
you phrase it like sound like she was
reading me bedtime stories a good kid
oh rich it must be terrible having your
own personal audio book oh how terrible
it would be for to have someone read you
books
oh we got something done we got we got
the battery in we got the battery in the
car I need a weapon I'm gonna go check
the a firing range over here bring
Corona and sister back on sometime
please you know I know my sister who
lives in Scotland is gonna be in town in
November Oh uh-oh
but my sister who was not medical but a
doctor she has a doctorate well I would
like to protest but it works out really
good the last time are you okay with it
obviously that's up to you that like
that is a judgment call for you she
might want to if she was you know it
works out like gangbusters last time I
think you have what I think you have you
have performers genes in your family
your sister was such a damn natural she
was she effortlessly went along with
jokes and talked so I can only assume
that the same would be true of any other
member of your family so obviously
that's it's your call it's not a
decision I can make
but it's a doctorate in you can even ask
her these questions not my business to
share this shit yeah her doctorates in
fuck-you ology huh yeah she's got a BS -
hey it's a Bachelors of Science
picked cleaned
oh the four-seater has oh my god the
four-seaters closed we just need keys
none mrs. rich
maybe reading Lindbergh's the only rule
is it has to work some sabermetrics
guide tries to work their mathemagics on
a failing minor league ball team for a
season you'd enjoy it no pressure
I thought yeah mate isn't that Moneyball
isn't that the plot of Moneyball it's
Jack this is not just the plot to a book
this is a movement that's going on in
modern baseball right right it's
actually going on has happened oh yeah
but I like I'm saying isn't isn't that
also another popular book slash movie
yes yeah yeah min maxing real life
sports looking at stats differently what
does this really mean and taking a more
scientific look at baseball
I like it super nerdy oh shit someone is
running towards this super fucking dirty
but great someone who's running towards
the car keys
then bloodshot says you mentioned Conan
the new XO Man O'War from valiant is
basically Conan in space XO is on an
alien planet living as a farmer until he

straighten the painting again ok
dr. Luba Dobson's when I saw Jack next
to the play-doh board on the YouTube
thumbnail for the latest best of the
worst yo I knew I was in for a great
episode no matter what happened also
rich eating in car was funny as fuck or
hell or something I guess that seems
like they ran out of room was funny as
funny as yeah no I it was that was very
interesting thumbnail I don't know if
Mike chose that thumbnail just because
my shirt happened to perfectly match the
play-doh board or if he was just playing
up you know the the mean not dropping
the ball Joker did a great job on the
thumbnail in general yeah always always
agreed
who hides an emulator in there Walt
right why can't you drop the ball they
bullying you I will I'm sure I will one
of these days I'm not worried about it
it's you know like it doesn't really
matter who gets to drop the ball because
we all watch the same movies no matter
what rich use the spit bucket for mr.
pity I took two bites you can't you
can't once you have a bite mark in it
you can't redo that you're gonna pull
the hammer grab a box there's gonna be a
brightness right right right oh it was
it was good too big though I mean I did
I did not finish it I looked at her
mom's it was it was good like three
patty for the record yeah it looked
monstrous Zoloft four thousand says hey
rich and Jack just wanted to ask your
opinion on what's the best way for a
game to use microtransactions games like
shadow of war with loot boxes are
starting to feel like se knows thanks
with love I don't the best way to use
microtransactions is don't use
microtransactions
they're fucking obnoxious I pay a game I
want to own the game and not and not buy
of spend money for 50 bucks so I have a
device that will continually give
someone else my money after I've already
spent the money on the thing I spent
money on microtransactions can fuck
right off you're Jason congratulations
you know in general rich I will agree
with you microtransactions
can fuck right off I think though as
long as they remain cosmetic only oh if
they're not cosmetic the game can fuck
off entirely yeah Oh a or then I am
simply never going to touch the game
this Jason only gets three traps by the
way that's not a lot of traps at all
someone's upstairs might want to skip
shadows were then we'll see if it's paid
to win or not we'll see how bad it is
without microtransactions
microtransactions cuz i will tell you i
plan on buying nothing else in shadow of
war because the game already cost 60
bucks hey isn't that a single player
again yes but it has it actually has
microtransactions shadows warfare
believe you can buy orcs for your honey
or something oh yeah yeah nice yeah nice
you can see this one from what camera
glitch yeah i know-oh-oh well we saw
most of it yeah you dickhead fine
they dump I don't support the game at
all dumped by a shadow for wine it's
kind of too late we bought it for the
stream just when it came out my guys
making one to stream and I knew nothing
of microtransactions inept in whether or
not I condemn the game we'll see how the
game plays without buying shit jack shit
I still don't like it
hey there little Miss battery let's go
have some fun ah
they said one that's fun doop doop doop
do you isn't tipping written check just
a micro transaction well the difference
is you don't get anything tipping us
haha cosmetic or otherwise all right the
people tipping us did not pay $60 for
the privilege of watching the stream in
the first place right this dream is
available for free and the tip is
entirely voluntary
why didn't they put this game on sale
for Friday the 13th because it's
Halloween season and there was a Friday
the 13th and people were gonna pay full
price for this game right now right what
put it on sale when people are gonna pay
full price
shit
area oh that's nice
that's just not nice I'm very very sad
excuse me you have to do that too in
Schad in speedos yes where is everybody
Chadd saying there's better things ahead
punch one you know the head punch one is
more silly yeah that's why I like it
saying a deadly tonight jack
I'm feeling good also I think these
people might be fuckin with each other
I mean should've hit him first I should
have hit him with my flavor first that
was me getting cocky
I don't have a stamina bar oh oh shit
I'm still gonna get you I'm still gonna
get you give me a Bugsy you got a shift
yeah
oh we're what
I mean he's gonna have pocket knives you
should hack him a bit he's gonna hit me
and knocked me down again guard chasing
a guard it's completely overpowered
actually he disconnected you have the
perfect time yes he did that dickhead
disconnect before I could get the kill
thing does Jason call that move the
crotch rocket Oh first of all nice
there's two people still alive
interesting
Jack having played a number of pubsey
games off stream do you think you were
stream sniped on your streams if so what
do they possibly get out of it
you know they they possibly get a
location out of it but I don't really
think we were oh here we go now we get
to see nice that means white why would
they bother right we we know for sure
that someone stream sniped us how are
you were you by the car yeah you were I
got you
got him we know at least one person
stream sniped us like that person who
like you know just found me right away
yeah oh there's still there's more
people Oh time Jairus sure let's hit him
in the nuts yay I killed eight out of
eight I know that 100 head disconnected
I'm counting it
I know coun that totally should yeah
you did great job I feel really good
about that my you were a beastly Jason
my man Jason stress have not dulled with
with lack of use my counselor strats you
know a little sure but you're that new
character to it might be he might have
some quirks throwing you off it's like
slow or something right she's been so
long yo and his stamina does not
regenerate very fast yeah that's what
you know you get into that mindset we
just kind of know what to do
instinctually and you know right now all
it is is thinking about you know what I
can grow on my farm currently it's just
a different it's a gear shift jack is
the taker of balls absolutely what does
screen snide mean extreme snipe and
that's when you're playing an online
multiplayer game like this or like pub G
and somebody who's watching your stream
just kind of conspire and track you down
and kill you easier so you know like a
game like this or like pub G where you
know you want to hide you want other
people not to know where you are and
people know exactly where you are
because you're streaming it because
you're streaming it exactly but no I
don't think it was ever a big issue for
us except for that one time but I killed
that guy and so it turned into an
entertaining moment yeah which of course
is the balance for anyone who streams
pub G is you want to be entertaining and
stream sniping can be entertaining
mixie and stream sniping us right now I
know I can mix in I see that do nerds
have a stamina bar yes but it's first of
all yeah the Nerds are usually the
better at fixing things
fixing things
any chance of firming a party with the
chap I think we do at least one before
we go all right sir yeah sure what time
again how are you doing now or 9:30 time
I start 7:00
yeah after this one we'll do one with
the chat no 6 ok started on time today I
feel really good about a great time it
was great everything went gangbusters
we're gonna trust commit sin to not to
play with us and maybe just listen to us
instead of actually watching and stream
sniping look if you're not playing this
game as part of a group playing is one
of the nerves is the way to go
especially the girl nerd she's great she
she has good good stealth and good
repair yeah yeah hippies not bad his
repair is really good and I like his
composure
that's stamina oh that's killer that's
killer it is by the way like I don't
think I would want to play as him yeah
the lack of the lack of regen is really
terrible
tired sad says either have you played
Super Mario run uh yeah I played at the
the the mobile game the phone game the
phone a Super Mario game it's not bad
it's nothing mmm bird being expensive
for a phone game like ten dollars
mm-hm and I did not want to pay $10 for
it but it's a platformer and it's
alright okay Justin that maybe not worth
$10 a four-seater has a bad real not
especially haven't Mario maker around we
had like you know well but this is on
your phone this is a Mario game you can
play on your phone coming so that's
that's what they were they were hoping
to sell that aspect of it but there's a
million endless look there's a million
runners on phones already
that's the two-seater okay alright can
you bind keys in this game as of the
last time I played it no I don't know if
they've changed that we have not checked
tired sad also said thoughts on Jim
Carrey and what happened to him what are
the details of this num or just in
general he's a weirdo now he's he's kind
of a weirdo now when there's something
was girlfriend dying like that and they
were gonna blame him because he gave her
the prescription medicine that she I
have no idea about any of this I think
this is something I heard I don't know
if it was complete BS I I have not heard
any of this the the thing I saw recently
was you know he went to like this red
carpet event and just started like
saying what's the point of all this why
are you here talking to people you guys
are idiots everyone's an idiot and it's
basically kind of having a public mental
breakdown oh god am I thinking of a
different celebrity okay I have no idea
and I'm sorry
you know he's a he's a millionaire
oh my gasps isn't yeah that's good I
chase enough
supposedly he gave his girlfriend an STD
or a bunch of STDs according to them and
then dumped her when she tried to
confront him on it and then she killed
herself Wow
I think that's just awful all around I
know what the front the fuck am I
supposed to say about that we talk about
comedy no we do dark I owe very little
about this and I don't feel comfortable
commenting on it tired sad says have
either of you revisited Big Trouble in
Little China it would be perfect for a
review not saying it won't happen I know
we got a lot at a plate right now
there's a lot of shit yeah
about the drop man there's a lot of shit
about to drop now people if you listen
to us then I kind of regularity you know
that I love Big Trouble in Little China
I remember it fondly it has been a long
time since I've seen it my friends tease
me for preferring 24 frames per second
and they say 60fps film is the future
thoughts on this topic so far it hasn't
really worked
I don't know anybody that's a high frame
rate that that came I grant yeah
I don't know anybody I've never met
anybody who has preferred then neither
have I I think you just know weirdos I
and I guess here's here's some real talk
as far as high frame rate cinema is
concerned I have never seen a high frame
rate film okay because I don't I just
don't care shit the cars getting out
fuck fuck
I need a weapon and then I can maybe go
have them fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
first thing it's weird when you see at
the movie they're gone does it makes it
look like cheap video yeah but it's cool
in a video game
right what's deal what's the deal jack
to two different mediums there's no that
that's easy like they're just two
different things and is the car getting
out getting out shit is it just because
we associated with cheap video that's
the question and it possibly than it is
you know it is technically superior and
future generations who don't grow up
watching cheap video there you're I'm
watching you know shit online streaming
at sixty it'll look fine to them it'll
become the future is that possible of
course it's possible
oh I got keys I got keys the keys I got
keys I got keys damn them Millennials
right
they're okay I just dropped a health
pack by you and I got keys actually
start the fucking car now
yeah time to get out of here
Oh move it move it
yeah VR movies in the future you'll
absolutely need high frame rate of VR
movies
how do you do cinematography with with
with with VR yeah
no V like VR will will kill movies as we
know them now there there is there is no
camera as a point of reference anymore
yeah eyes work Jeff over there
I brought the keys oh shit look at this
there we go nice nice
don't let Jack drive I know I'm picking
out I'm remembering I'm remembering
everything it's gonna be fine they
already have those 360 degree YouTube
videos it doesn't work
yep yep yeah they suck that's full Megan
keeps showing you what to look at and
painting a picture and telling a story
through the manipulation of images and
that's just thrown out the fucking
window if you just know the error higher
art of cinematography is gone yes
yeah all right oh so uh next game anyone
anyone who wants to play with us hop on
Steam get on Friday 13th most of you
should prob you're friends with rich
already well we'll get we'll get a
private game going just one more person
commits ian is the only one that's left
can mix ian as hot pants commits Ian I
probably shouldn't be telling you this
but someone who just died dropped the
drop defuse you fucking cheer well I
didn't say where the guys fucking you
fucking cheater no you didn't you don't
damn well he stream sniping you you know
damn well I actually would have been way
more helpful if I would have said where
they died because I don't know where
they died and I'm very really sorry
about that if you get banned you get me
pan where lawn did is me jackass
friends lists fold I'm sorry what do you
want rich to do about that I purge every
once in a while but like he was keeping
up with purging is hard let's go through
we'll go through and 100 or more days
it's usually the thing right I I don't
even I do less than that I do like a
month like if you haven't been on in a
month they can see this right now you
see my River we gotta get we got alt-tab
okay
let's get out of this game first huh
no we're just joking we know comic scene
is not stream sniping us we were just
joking level 99 level 99 rich you're
almost at level 100 100 percent awesome
let's go to 101 or something weird right
does it feels like it's not one night I
think exactly 101 oh that's funny I
don't know okay so now if we if we
alt-tab but we should be able to go into
steam and not have them see it yeah okay
so now we can go to your friends boom

start at the bottom we're gonna we're
gonna do some purging some quick purge
in here 2 hours 9 hours like this is
that does that mean like they're just
they have yeah like though look at this
person gone oh wait wait wait there's an
easier way to do this I'm just a profile
is okay manage friends lists okay so we
just now we just click them okay I said
like this person gone this person gone
43 days just do it
boom gone 66 days gone 45 minutes you're
fine like this person when I think when
it says last online and forever no I
think that the profiles are set to
private it's not shared that'd be my
guess
gone
I'm purged and rich I'm good I'm making
the hard decision so you don't give a
shit it's fine
54 days by don't play online games but
it's just it's just the status think of
something there somebody being able to
say there are my friends list really

hours that's why I didn't notify a month
you passed 164 boom I did it yeah there
Oh 114 top right 216 days oh yeah

alright yes you don't play private
matches must much so this is news to me
looks like you can decide who gets to be
Jason okay guys I mean we're gonna play
on the new map because why not I I don't
know how this works I'm in a private
match do you guys just oh wait here we
go invite here we go choose friends to
invite so you have to be playing Friday
the 13th I assume she was friends to
invite she's named chard have some
significance red chard sad dumb right
all right
the rich art - the rich is just hard all
these dumb kids I'm playing you know the
lobby afraid the cherries I'd chose it
no not cherries ed fucking Pokemon
dipshit alright so as you guys might be
able to see I got I go to invite people
and we get this here's what we're gonna
do is we're gonna do rich we're gonna
we're gonna turn it off and turn it back
on again we're gonna classic IT solution
it going on
it wasn't letting us invite anyone so
we're gonna OH
offline mode go to the view that's why
figured it out figured it out rich wants
to be the very best like no one ever was
dundun dundun chard is ardh that's great
that's great it's great just because I
know you you generally don't care for
Pokemon yeah and so the fact that all
the kids are like you like Pokemon you
must love Pokemon makes it makes me very
happy
all right so now if we go to private
match and we're gonna be Jason and now
if we go to invite there's everybody

run from you that's true you just have
to find them
I have a shitty luck

the important one
okay okay I feel double Wow you're three
nope shit I thought I hit B god damn it

hi Tommy's priority oh come on I was
swinging oh I was swinging rich smash it
smash it
but they still in the house and they
running away I see I assume oh I did it

kind of fart well that in the front
window I'd bust that - she's definitely
getting on the boat
huh yeah but more people could get out
if they fix this sorry Bugsy
maybe I can catch her in the boat still
yeah you probably can speed is of the
essence what okay where is she she
assumed the jig was up
oh wow she knows about the boat yeah and
I'm out of traps
and a lot of traps rich we sure she's
not in the house she could be the house
oh it didn't globe what you know you
know Kay no go right I'm not gonna back
back soon yeah I have a little bit I
feel bad that's alright that's just my
brain right I'm on your side Jack I'm
with you I'm with that I'm happy for
that you know I don't trust that she
would have given up on the boat you know
that easily right Jason can go
underwater the counselors cannot
I hate this house
nice talk on so we'll see if trap strats
I don't hear anybody fuck alright
weird well then we need to concentrate
on the car I guess you guys working on
this true blue reviewer says last tip
for tonight when it comes to start Eve
Ali what's your opinion on using mods or
reading the wiki
I feel like games like that require some
help but I don't want to feel like I'm
cheating yeah do whatever is fun I think
in a game like starter Valley if if you
think like painstakingly figuring out
what everyone likes through trial and
error is tedious I just use the wiki mmm
I don't think anyone's gonna get upset
about it No and mods I mean if you think
a mod would be fun just use it that's
the important thing that's what they're
there for
oh I think a comedian here folks they
didn't lock the doors
oh there's a trap dragged into the trim
oh they got it on nice they got it on
too bad they're good
you're welcome III honestly I thought
that was the dick one night I was I was
thinking that was the deck one term said
says even though it may make some money
Justice League feels like a genuine
franchise ender something about it feels
like Batman Forever money-making but
also the beginning of the end that was
that was a Man of Steel for me it's a
bit terrible both are terrible movies
the 97th jackal says who would you
rather exorcise your demons ash Williams
or doomed I'm doomed guys far more
efficient well wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait
exorcise your demons no you want the
demon out of you
doom guys brutal efficiency means he's
just gonna put a shotgun to your head
ash might try some kind of mumbled e
jumble with the book sure all right
he probably has to like you first like
like Pedro I think I think this might be
a case for doom guys a little too
efficient oh well I mean yeah I guess I
was a little unclear as to what exorcise
your demons me like like I have a demon
problem in my house I can only I can
only presume it means you're possessed
okay we're talking about just you have
demons in your house and you need
someone to fight them
it's doing guy yeah you're not gonna
have a house left but fuck demon you
don't take chances with that shit right
Ash saves people but dooms billions in
the process yeah we're talking about
somebody saving me man I'm the person I
care about in this scenario how does
this affect me is the only question you
ever need to ask Wow let's shift ends on
its own yeah how much at all it is not a
very powerful shift hi oh oh I missed an
environmental I don't even know I didn't
see him one will win because of his own
cat is back doing a hash thing else
great how did someone get out vote
bean I guess I got the person in the
book somebody probably came back the
boat was ready to go somebody couldn't
easily have just come back to it unless
you just did it why you just asked yeah
hey whoo-hoo Tejada how'd he get out
you hit t2 just to kiss the map watching
the stream while it's gone
hey who got out
you did what
person on the dock quit the person on
the dock quit okay wait so what happened
who didn't I kill are you gonna be Jason
I got no back to the doom - thing one
will win because of his uncanny luck but
you might get killed in the fodder the
other will kill quick but with
collateral so you say exercise in and
demons I can only presume you're talking
about an exorcism sure like the demon is
inside you right right which case your
only chance is ash because the doom guy
he's not gonna give any Fox shot gun to
the head yep there then you are the
demon right that's a that said that two
people lives right so something was
something was not something wink stir in
the kool-aid cuz I think I killed
everyone don't worry about it it's not a
big deal it
all right anonymous hey guys I'm sure
you get this question a lot hi but what
movie did you watch as a kid and love
but watching it as watching it older
it's not all that good oh is it telling
you for me it's good burger love the
stream
keep kicking ass Howard the Duck
adventures in babysitting obviously
Howard the dark bottom Louise when
you're a dumb kid Monster Squad oh my
god the chat said that at the same time
Monster Squad yeah it's not a great Oh
fuckin hippie
Monster Squad you kicked the Wolfman in
the nards fell on Ted's bogus journey oh
wow we will have to disagree there yeah
that's great good if anything that movie
has gotten better with age better than
the original original bill in Ted yeah
absolutely I'm just sayin
I'll be with you I'll be with you on
that I got your back okay okay I got
your back there
Flutie croissant says duty Chris Oh says
hey guys love your streams with E
they're great pick me up when I'm having
a bad day thanks for the great content
as I'm looking to get back into editing
what do you recommend in an editing
computer right yeah see that's a whole
different that's a whole different bag
of worms right there
I'd say hard drive space but hard drives
are so big right now is that even an
issue no no not really
like and you can go external for days so
yeah like it's all about processing
power and for rendering your GPU your
graphics processing unit but like a
different kind of carpet of gaming card
though right no no actually is you can
use gaming cards for your processing
because because it's doing the same
thing it's just rendering video that's
all a graphics card does but that's very
different I figured in terms of video
editing like the rendering was like
processor intensive well let's see
there's that's that's what I'm getting
at is there are actually there's two
different things so like playback while
you're editing ok is your CPU rendering
out like like taking your edit and
turning it into its own video it takes
GPU I thought it would have been the
other way around
nope huh I'm wait I'm waiting for
someone to disagree with him but I do
believe that's how it works ok but but
also like I'm not a gearhead
when it comes to computers were
currently I'm editing on my macbook pro
like i'm editing on a laptop I'm correct
so great great coding and whatnot I've
really just like the processor doing its
job not a video card no well if you
wanted to go fast you know you need the
video card huh I was already in this
house I think jack is actually schooling
rich well it's not shocking I don't
video on it I mean I'm not trying to be
a jackass and say he's wrong I am merely
expressing kind of surprised I wanna
clarify that
right right well it says you know
there's a lot of factors to consider
but with any editing software you are
going to use they will have recommended
specs you know like like with any video
game it they'll have like minimum and
recommended specs for what computer you
should have and then it all depends on
what you're doing if you're gonna be
doing a lot of like motion graphics
stuff a lot of After Effects stuff you
have to go heavy on that CPU and because
it's going to take a lot of processing
power but if you're just doing normal
video editing you might want to invest a
little bit more in the GPU to make sure
that your renders can happen in a timely
fashion okay yeah and you know a lot of
moving parts I'm not a gearhead rich
what do you do for rlm if you don't edit
find someone else's jerk-off app org huh
did you you did B of rich everyone knows
the contributions you make to our LM on
camera invaluable contributions to what
you make to our LM on camera what do you
do off camera work around a studio and
set building a building a problem yep
I'm hit some I made some walls for
something recently that I had to carve
and paint you guys handmade artisanal
set walls male is something weird going
on with our graphic settings people are
moving really jerky yeah yeah I'm with
you
but yeah so yeah you set build to take
care of the studio and also you are the
only person on camera who matters that
is absolutely true
yeah we're chugging here we're dropping
frames in game is what's happening
okay that no I don't have a map that
house had the phone in it oh wait uh
anyone have a fuse all right
where well God we suck we got nothing we
are some rich letter media exactly rich
letter media who is the one person who
is absolutely vital to any red letter
media program I think I contribute I my
job description is a little of
everything little this little VAD what
needs to be done we need to find a
1930's frying pan yep rich is on it we
need to find that rich good
I know he duped me yes I look dude
you'll built the wheel
I built plane keto oh yeah yeah because
it's a private match you can you can uh
jerkiness is so weird
I think it's frame dropping it didn't do
this before no no it did not do this
before
oh that's this Jason's a good Dodger
he's like he's like the matrix oh I like
this kill this is a good one who was
playing is Jason hits buttons bring up
thing where do you have to go into mute
players now yeah Darth Ozzy didn't
select used to do it
select your start back and forward one
of those yeah it's not turn it this time
weird yeah
Darth açaí is our Jason doing pretty
good job doing a pretty good job dr. Lu
dub says with all the diet talk i've
been motivated in the losing weight
first weigh-in 99 kilograms
218 pounds ok easing into it nice this
week no soft drink and no chocolate oh
ok good
more next week after cheat day good luck
that's that's a good start man like just
getting rid of soda in your life does
does a hell of a lot of good it does a
heck of a lot of good man
we're down um my lowest before cheat day
Saturday obviously I'm down to 193 is
that's the my new low pretty excited
about that so overall down 14 pounds
it's still losing still feeling good
every day every day is a battle new low
that's impossible that's that's
physically impossible to reach a new low
with a diet you were you were an embryo
once Jack I'd like to see you lose that
much weight I was waiting I was waiting
for the get for the gotcha I was waiting
for the gotcha rich Evans nobody's doing
shit on this map we don't got our shit
together guys yeah your diet low
conception I am 6 - I'm 6 feet 2 inches
so according to the United States body
mass index chart I should be somewhere
between I should be around 170 that's
what they say as of right in the middle
of normal as far as your body mass index
goes and I know like a lot of people
have conflicting thoughts about whether
you should like look to your BMI but I
am just using him as benchmarks
my personal goal is around 180 I would
love to be around 180 so not too much
longer to go I think I can do it
Jonesy the don't says dear rich
thank you for constantly recommending
TNG I finally decided to give it a whirl
and I loved every minute of it tonight
stream is the only thing this weekend
that got me to stop haha you're welcome
good old TNG that's fantastic show
fantastic show Braun Adam Sandler says I
get confused by people getting excited
by things based on the label for example
the new Pacific Rim doesn't share the
creative team or most of the characters
yet people are excited del Toro missing
yeah I feel the same way about a lot of
things Guillermo is missing from Pacific
Rim - apparently shit but I mean in
general things that are made by a Lycan
like like before when that came out yeah
you excited about the for not made by
Looking Glass to use because they're
dead none of the same creative team and
not the same way and the nothing is the
same way why well I see but I think I I
think the reason people do get hyped is
a lot of times it is the same team right
and so then like that can be just a
gauge of whether or not you would like
something oh I have liked
uh-uh I have liked Star Wars I like Star
Wars a new hope when the second one
comes out it seems like the same people
I might enjoy that as well you know well
yeah
but sometimes it's not the same people
that's what the question is addressing
though well there's the question was
liking something based on labels alone
so how many people know that del Toro
isn't involved in Pacific Rim - right
okay okay you just see Pacific Rim - you
go I like that first one alright watch
the second one how many people dig a
little deeper the answers not many yep
what do you what do you girls doing just
having a bit of a squad party
according to Robyn says Ridge I'm moving
to a condo and Madison soon how much
would you charge to help with
renovations also how much would Jack
charge to watch you while saying
nurturing supportive things for a
million dollars and you'll help renovate
for million dollars and I certainly
won't guarantee I'll do a good job right
but I will help okay for million dollars
that's a good price
you know what I won't go so high because
I won't be working if I just have to go
there and say nice things to rich I'll
only charge you a million for me how
about this over it why don't we bundle a
bundle deal fumble deal a bundled via
for the both of us is four and a half
million oh I was gonna say three million
nine hundred ninety nine hundred
thousand nine hundred ninety nine
thousand dollars that would is ensuing
so many nines nice 289 but the but the
bundle is for it so instead of paying
five million you get you get something
for five million for the low-low bundle
price of four and a half million we just
saved you five hundred thousand dollars
you're welcome Oh God traps drafts
few extensions hey guys even though I'm
the worst you even even though I'm the
worst you have played with I love
playing with you thanks for everything
you guys do
oh no problem thank you can fix it then
you know if we if we gave him a real
price accepted if we'd never would never
come back and we would just vanish they
show up your warehouse I'd be the last
anyone ever heard of us I do I think I
would if if if someone did agree to meet
that price for those things there'd be a
little recon involved oh sure like we
need to check your identity I will be
notifying the police that we're coming
we need we need pictures of you we need
some collateral we would need a few
things we would to make it official if
someone was like I will absolutely pay
you five million dollars to come and
help move my house renovations
Bill Gates is just such a big fan
wouldn't it be amazing Bill Gates just
just gave us four million dollars I
would help renovate your house Bill
Gates you seem like a cool enough dude
what do you need rich do you not trust
your fans like I'm sure some of you I'm
sure and trustworthy but there's some
weirdos out there man
tell us a creepy story you know I could
tell you a creepy story but no I'm not
gonna I was gonna try to think of a joke
but I didn't in time
so that's do they go if you want a
creepy story get yourself the ghost box
and you get 11 short creepy stories key

couple of stretch it has been we forgot
to put up the torture you guys skipped
my second tip did you skip faired in
second too
cops insist us can have been known to
act as extras in first movies if people
pay them like 20 bucks for an hour of
shooting any legal tricks you use / know
of to pad production value of a movie
it's a bad production value first I'm
hearing out the cop 1 right you know
it's true shoot it in the woods right
that's the opposite of what they're
looking for
I know but doesn't everyone things like
well this shoot in the woods the woods
are a real place that exists if you
shoot in the woods they know your movies
a cheap piece of shit that's true avoid
shooting in the woods if you're in a
low-budget or amateur filmmaker avoid it
if you can I know it's easy it's really
easy wait a minute this these are the
tips from Sunday October 8th October 4th
who's in charge of this paste bin
