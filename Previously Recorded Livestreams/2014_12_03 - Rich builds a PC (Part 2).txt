now they're talking about the technical
aspects of the soccer ball robot how
else would a robot move in sand it's try
mean a soccer ball robots a good round
fun yeah
obviously there are magnets yeah see I
saw it's not like it's rolling in one
continuous motion it's not like flipping
around or anything little part right
right so you just have a track in the
middle and you have to like half's on
each side and those are the things that
rotate you could do that I do think it
was a magnet more friendly I could not
care less
yeah but not care less about that girl
robot all right
you know I'm phirni because I've seen
one shot of it and know nothing about
its story or what it's doing or what it
what place it has on the movie right I'm
not going to get overly concerned
sorry
keep reading reading your comments maybe
see if they make sense some of them
don't look they're asking if we can
auction off that static bang LeAnn the
next eBay auction signed by recipients
we know rich will not action off is
always no I'm using parts of this
actually the TVD drive some hard drives
okay you guys talking about the best way
to ship us beer because yes figure that
out uh some people have done that and
what they've done is individually
wrapped the bottles in bubble wrap okay
and then put the whole thing in a big
box that's also filled with some sort of
packing material sure that's a good idea
that way did they don't shake around a
lot they don't make a lot of noise or
the ever reports the post offices they
want to question it and open it up and
see what's and I don't think you can
send it through the mail yeah you can if
you wrap it up well enough where they
don't bother to check what's it okay
they do is they catch you sending them I
don't know I think they just say you
can't send that and then turn you up
turn you back oh you guys want to see
what rich is doing how is he had a brain
that's okay we can just hi rich okay it
might show your face be prepared I would
be unfortunate cuz nobody has ever seen
what rich Evans looks like well you know
now watch are you okay now yes now you
can see what rich is doing a little bit
better the question for Jay here is will
you drink the beer on half an event if
they send it to you um probably either
that we're best of the workers sure
Kevin the fridge
Junie will pull it out mm-hmm yeah I
think the many beers that happens into
us we have drinkin hmm drink them on one
of the show
does anybody have a little flashlight
because I'm trying to line up black
screws and I'm a black peg through a
black hole oh it is working it's just
really like let me get an extra large
yeah I can't see what I'm doing that's
bad sure okay rich they're saying
because now a facecam has appeared on a
prereq we've sold out okay how much how
many did I just get for some 100 not
very much no we sold out for really
cheap um mind if we use this we're
getting more tomorrow so we can replace
okay I did you already use the one on my
camera bag oh I don't know there should
be a big role on my camera bag trip yeah
Premium Cola what a moat music is
playing Oh Barbara fiag al changes sorry
about that
what we playing barbra streisand Barber
of Seville I was just a guy singing all
barber still hmm
what's wrong with partnership it was
just a guy singing audio on a singing
voice okay I didn't like that pleadians
don't like classical music I think
everyone likes classical music but you
know it's like a guy singing and we're
talking I could see that Jay Bowman's
beard says prereq hasn't been the same
since that PC builds true yeah you're
absolutely right
you guys wanted III think it's fun I
think it's neat
I I like this side of it I like I hope
everyone is gaining an appreciation for
for how hard these things are to make
what can be seen how do they adjust this
jacket what do mean for being able to
see in here you want to see in there
well you know what as soon as I get
these screws on I can put it up right
and then I can just adjust the camera
that okay sure okay oh yeah you're a
classical good opera bad what the fuck
indeed every 801 thank you for
subscribing we very much appreciate it
oh it's true
feline diabetes says come on rich
children in China build a hundred of
these a day no but they have tiny this
thing they build 100 of them a day yeah
they're probably pretty quick cuz I do
it all the time old man eyes I got old
man everything
Rich's convinced himself that he's an
elderly person this is this is the other
the other day during a prereq discussion
rich called me middle-aged no no no I'm
32 years old
that is not literally that is not
middle-aged unless you're planning a die
very early right so let's all settle
down Jack why don't you have a proper
tripod i mean i do i used a tiny shitty
cheap tripod because it's a bit smaller
yeah there's not a lot of room in here
because there's not a lot of room in
here we have very nice tripods yes here
it's almost like we're a professional
video production operation or something
it's one of those things but nice
tripods are large yes and heavy and take
up a lot of space and we don't have a
lot of space right now
so why Jack is younger than Collin
probably I was common as he mentioned
earth um yeah you are younger yeah oh
yeah people always seem very interested
in our ages for some reason I don't get
a clue they want to know they relate to
us but I know that you're very aged oh
really something L knowing no no no not
at all
yeah yeah who knows
Collins 41 is that true uh I don't know
why I'm asking the chat how do you know
oh there's stalker because the internet
is full of creepers oh speaking of
creepy yeah Jack Jay I saw tusk oh my
god gonna bring this up yourself to us I
saw Kevin Smith's latest film tusk first
of all why would you do such a thing
well here's the thing here's the thing
okay uh for anyone that hasn't heard
talk about Kevin Smith down here before
I hate him yeah I didn't use to he was a
big inspiration to me when I was 14
years old girl to hate him I hate his
face have you ever noticed in my donor
stomach recent pictures of him he's
always doing this like overly
exaggerated like excited smile do you
know I'm talking about he does it all
the time and I just did I see the
pictures of him that all okay they pop
up in like Lee websites and shit I hate
him I hate his personality I hate his
attitude towards critics basically
everything uh but he did have a big
influence on me when I was younger
that's over so I'm always mildly curious
to see what he's doing now even though
he was supposed to have retired from
making movies years ago he still keeps
doing it but and he's also reached this
like fuckit point where he knows he's
completely irrelevant so he's like I'm
just gonna do whatever the hell I feel
like sure
so tusk weird premise by a director that
I used to kind of be
so curious to see it not an offer I
would go out of my way to see it's a
theater like I do not care but it's on
iTunes now so streaming services have
completely devalued movies to the point
where it's like oh it's there so I guess
I'll watch it um so I watched tusk I
really liked it I really liked it uh and
I would completely understand why people
would hate it
which I don't even know do all people
hate this movie I don't know what the
feedback on it has been I'm careful the
small amount of feedback I've heard is
it's someone is that it was bad because
someone was attempting to make a
purposefully bad movie okay it's not
that okay it is bad okay okay here's the
thing it's it's bad in the same way like
I can't in good conscience like trash
this movie and still talk about how much
I love movies like like basket-case or
the toxic avenger like it's a shitty
dumb creative b-movie I was what it is
if you're watching it to just watch a
conventional movie you'll probably think
it's horrible and I would completely
understand that because totally it's all
over the place
but it was weird and interesting enough
to keep me entertained
okay and Michael parks you know Michael
parks is the actor he was in if you have
seen from Gustav dawn he's that you know
the the the cop that comes into the gas
station to begin to that movie he has a
big long monologue he's a really great
character actor he's didn't come Smith's
last movie too but okay he's been in
some Tarantino stuff really really good
actor he is so he's a great actor he's
so committed he's the one that turns
what's his face just long into a walk
all right the only yeah okay okay he is
so committed to that part and he sells
it there's a large portion of the booty
once Justin Long gets to his house where
it's just there's a handful of scenes
right
where it's just him like telling stories
about his life and he used to be you
know was on the sea growing up on the
CEO and he's just like fascinating to
watch and for a little while it's a
genuinely good movie and then it gets
weird and stupid
ah but he's still committed and so he
kind of sells the rest of the movie oh
I'm shocked tonight I know I'm shocked
that I enjoyed it I really wasn't my I
was curious to see it but I did not have
any expectations to like it sure and I'm
assuming a lot of people don't like it
um but like I said it works in the the
b-movie way and not in a way where it's
like there's lots of movies that come up
now that are like trying to do the the
grindhouse thing or like making a
throwback movie sure it's not bad it
feels too genuine for that like it just
feels like a like a b-movie without like
trying to pay homage to other B movies
right it's just a weird little premise
and it's a very simple movie to like guy
turned someone into a walrus like that's
the movie um hold on for a second out of
killable J thank you for subscribing
that's a little weird not J just to the
lower J Oh kill a bulge maybe kill bulge
thank you for scribing we very much
appreciate it I the most interesting
thing about what you just said to me was
it doesn't omage to other movies no it I
mean I know that the whole movie started
as a joke like it wasn't just something
they made up on their podcasts and then
you decided to turn into a movie yeah so
I know that the whole movie is a joke
but it's treated with sincerity and it's
actually pretty good looking like the
cinematography is nice it's got this
really like warm rich look to it um the
walrus suit a stupid-looking well but
it's so is the monster of basket-case
you know and that's like it's acceptable
in something like that so I don't know
wow I really liked it I cannot recommend
it cuz I think most people would hate it
I'm sure I'm shocked it was so off
kilter and like totally all over the
place
oh um Johnny Depp isn't it one which I
don't know if that's a spoiler like I
don't that was supposed to be secret but
I just revealed it so whatever well and
he is so his performance is at odds with
everything else he's doing it's like
something like like lost Michael Myers
performance like this comedic thing he's
doing and it's terrible
uh-huh but he's acting opposite hailey
Joe Osmond in the scene Haley Joel
Osment in the movie and he's actually
really really good and Haley because
this is Haley Joel Osment is Justin
Long's like co-host on a podcast and
Justin Long's girlfriend they're both
trying to find Justin long like figure
out what happened to her right and so
they meet up with Johnny Depp whose
delivery was completely horrible comedic
performance but he's talking about like
he's been tracking this guy for years
and you know this guy's trying to turn
people into walruses before and and
Johnny Depp's performance is so bad but
Haley Joel Osment is reacting to him
with such like sincerity and genuine
concern for his friends and he's very
believable so it's just like odd
completely mismatched tone it's so weird
okay so I guess I like it as a bad movie
but it's it's there's enough creativity
where it's not just like like a whole
layer like you're laughing at it for
being so inept it's just trying to do
all these different things that don't
really work together but it's still sort
of interesting to watch so that's my
take up tusks I like it I like it
now using cos usually like for best of
the worst you know like a lot of the
badness just comes from either but you
know budgetary reasons like a shitty
costume right where's general ineptitude
of the filmmaking general and aptitude
sure but this is bad for different
reasons but still engaging exactly well
that's like it like I mentioned
basket-case are any Frank Hannon Lauder
movie really or it's like I understand
the technical shortcomings but the movie
is entertaining enough to rise above
that
Fermat's like oh the monster looks
stupid you're like oh the monster looks
stupid it's empty you know stupid in a
good way mmm that's I was very shocked
to enjoy it so much and I'm shocked to
hear you I don't know there's probably
people listening on this that are gonna
go out and watch it they're gonna be so
mad at me
well hopefully if you're coming to the
movie as someone who has watched bad
movies or bi movies yeah
and to understand kind of that genre
maybe you can get some appreciation out
of this yeah cuz I I watched lots of
dumb weird shit weird B movies you know
and this was like watching one of those
it was one of those I was expecting it
to be like I was there's some bad Kevin
smithy stuff early on like the Justin
Long character is completely unlikable
like not like he's supposed to be sort
of like a cocky asshole and you could do
that and have the character be likable
this didn't do it he was just he's
actually really horrible like his
performance is bad and the characters is
horrible and then he goes to Canada I
thought furry meets Michael parks and
there's just like every possible
Canadian cliche is in there and it's
just if you like that stuff they'll vary
Kevin smithy but once it gets past Matt
I kind of stopped thinking about the
fact that it was a Kevin Smith movie Oh
which is a good thing that they hate him
so yeah well before we continue judge
holden judge holden thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it someone is
asking oh hold on Oh something very
important rich what I see octo J says
deep oopsies oopsies whoopsies
somebody stop rich Jack Oh Jack we have
a problem
hold on okay hold on I'm here stop
everything
dear God Jack stop everything this is
our people freaking out he's we're
freaking out because the fan you might
have had the fan right oh no I think
they wanted to see accidents happen
though and they manufacture it
they fucking manufacture it yeah I take
I take zero credit class zero Oh
oh man oh my god because I hated the S
is that gonna be to take it back out
Oh after dr. J is really sorry um that
someone was asking in the chat it's I
mean it's millions of comments away now
but how does this affect your perception
of Kevin Smith is a filmmaker uh he's
still a bad filmmaker I mean there's so
many inept things in the movie actually
the weirdest thing about the movie is
there's lots of like it's clear they
shot it with two cameras like an a
camera to be camera not just you know
get an angle switch to like it's so
close or you can tell they shot it with
two cameras
same time okay and but the two angles
are so similar to each other that when
it comes back and forth
it's like jarring it's like a really
like like close-ups of people where it
might be like a three-fold profile
sure and then the other angle is almost
the same 3/4 profile but maybe just a
little bit wider oh where when it cuts
back and forth you're like whoa that's
jarring that's awkward
so oh so not cutting like back and forth
between people but no see different
angles of the same person it happens
multiple times in the movie it's really
weird so he's still pretty inept as far
as a filmmaker goes but the ideas and
the performances and then the writing
like there's what parts of the movie
that it's just Michael parks like
talking and telling these stories and
and he's just like fascinating to watch
so look you know it works it works
despite the Kevin Smithee elements I've
always conceded and I think I will
always can see that I believe Kevin
Smith is a good writer yeah yeah there's
some stuff early on in this movie that I
didn't care for but more like the like I
said the Canada stuff or it's like Oh
God
oh and the main character the Justin lon
character's name is Wallace like walrus
like that's pretty obvious and stupid
and it has bad chemistry things in it
but it's also moving or Michael parks
turn someone into a walrus sure and
Johnny Depp plays Inspector Clouseau and
leads Haley Joel Osment help and find
his friend okay
all right
so that's my task review I don't know
like that that almost that almost like
sells me I'm watching Thomas God I mean
I fit
I mean not enough to like give money for
if it's on Netflix one day no capture
maybe I want it yeah interest now in the
climax of the movie is set to the song
tossed by Fleetwood Mac which is an
awesome song and I've had it stuck in my
head all day as that sound the only
reason you like it it's just because
they play one song at the end great
oh so octo J but what I could do is
saying is he thought the fan was in pole
orientation it's alright there's no need
for pump now it's it's an easy fix
everything's going to be fine everything
is going to be fun great back seat
general thank you for subscribing we
very much appreciate it and
how great is this tease avatar says
speaking of Co so what do you guys think
of the Pink Panther movies the originals
not the standard ship they were Steve
Martin Pink Panther movies that doesn't
exist no most of those don't exist if
you just keep telling yourself that
eventually they'll go away um oh I like
those movies I haven't seen him in a
very long time but my favorite was a
shot in the dark which I think was the
second one ever the Pink Panther is that
the only I Peter Sellers was great in
those movies Peter Sellers is ingenious
people should know that it was a shot in
the dark the one where they're on the
ski lodge um I remember a nudist camp I
don't think they go to a ski lodge
that's why I haven't seen him since high
school so it's hard to say about my
grade it's been a while it's been a
while yeah but they're great they're
great it's it's a different era and so
they're it's a different pace than
modern comedy yeah that was the thing I
noticed when I first saw I think the
first Pink Panther movie one he's not in
a lot of the movie like it wasn't his
series of movies at that point uses sort
of the breakout sir but yeah there's
like very leisurely plate paced they're
giving out like plot information and
there's no jokes and all of a sudden
something wacky happens I can have an
image burned into my brain forever it
whichever Pink Panther movie where
they're at the scheme
and he's kind of going back and forth
from room to room or oh no he's in his
bedroom and he's wrestling with this
blanket because his wife says she's cold
and his wife is like cheating on him or
something's up so she's going back and
making him going at dumb things as he
was wrestling with this blanket because
his wife said she was cold right and he
you know he's doing some some comic book
food already with the blanket and yeah
and eventually he gets it ready and
Peter Sellers has this thing where he
just stops and like looks at the blanket
like are you bringing for this blanket
and it's it's such a small communicant
but it's burned into my brain forever I
may not have seen whichever one that is
I don't know sighs just it's this tiny
little tick like looks at the blanket
any I mean Peter Sellers is fantastic
have you ever seen Pete I was just gonna
say I've never seen that's one I've
always meant to see and I've never got
around to watching it almost perfect I
hear it's a great movie yeah just about
perfect
it's not so they tell you put the fan on
the wrong way is that why it's not oh
Jesus Christ
hold on rich but now they're saying Jack
there is discussion that maybe octo Jay
was right oh my god
they're funny it is what it is folks the
question is whether or not the fan is
which direction the fan is going is it
going the same direction as the fan
behind it they're both going this way
these fans are going to take these fans
are take a whatever and I don't know
which way there is in is it this
important I don't know which way they're
going to spin you don't know which way
they're going to spend okay
the
Oh might know the airflows get this way
okay and that's the correct way
this one is this way to okay the both on
this way great but most on this way this
going in yet everything's fine every
time I got money both again yeah so yeah
in other words I just backseat fucking
computer experts it does yeah
yes okay after J yes we've we've checked
the arrows on the fan all right they are
both pointing out of the computer
great all right
we're doing good now being there has one
moment just two nights I don't know
finger has one moment and I won't i
won't spoil it
I will watch it eventually yeah I've
been meaning to see it for like years
when it's a moment at the beginning of
music but there's one moment where they
they drastically change the score of the
movie and it's supposed to be changed
but it's weird okay thanks you have a
problem but being there is she is it is
a perfect and wonderful movie
yeah I know the video is not perfectly
in sync with rich talking you know what
it's really not that important I'm just
gonna be honest so I'm not going to
adjust how far out is it or why would it
be off because the video is going
through the capture device and the
capture device is going through that and
that's looking out so just like the
whales it's like a like a half a second
delay no that's fine it's fine you do
not need to see Rich's mouth moving yes
but rich if you want to make them all
sick you can talk directly into the
camera what are you talking about the
audio sync is fine what what is that
rich this is the power spool this was
our things oh yeah you know it also
regulates voltage or something I'm sure
got something you just made up things
there's so many cords it's insane yeah
Nora normally before the stream would
start like if we were if we were playing
a game I would double check how much I
off put our audio to make sure that it's
you know perfectly or as closed synced
up for the game as possible but this
doesn't really matter
yeah we don't need this alright it's off
like two seconds I have whatever I don't
care that you should hear cuz Rich's
face isn't in it all that often shit
Audio is that whatever that doesn't
matter you know what guys it just
doesn't everything's fine every
everything is fine all the time Oh rich
they want to know what kind of zip drive
you got the 100 megabyte or the 250 mega
bail fuck yourself
ha ha you can see Jays beard on
literally hundreds of Internet videos
right now this is true yeah you can look
at any number of videos created in the
last year and a half two years all again
oh yeah over a year I don't remember my
girl in the beard sure so I know he
started growing into this kind of a joke
because that was when we started doing
best of the worst
yeah and everyone was calling Josh like
bearded hipster sure there was neckbeard
I was always talking about neck beards
yeah on our site we our opinions are
neck beard opinions I don't know that
means sure so I just started girl the
beer as a joke okay like this so I kept
up down that's my story
that's my beard story that's a good
beard story that's a terrible story
I have a map people are asking about the
type of Polish I use on my head now I do
use lotion after I shave that makes
sense
because you loot you you shave lotion
after yes I swap for men I use I go
through quite a bit when I shave my
entire head and face how often do you
shave your head do you do it you don't
do it every day not every day um a
couple times a week
okay I'll shave the whole thing or like
especially like before we shoot
something I make sure
that at least my head shape so if I
don't have time I'll just shave my head
be a little stubble like I knew today
they won't see that but I will I have my
beard stubble now but my aunt she oh my
god there's so much stuff on the credit
only they could see it no I had it it's
amazing how much some with my head is
smooth except I got this
Oh balls to my head yeah but my head has
you know cause problems it's caused
reflective problems there's one best of
the worst or there's like a light layer
right on the top yep I don't know which
oh that was but yeah
you know it happens that's fine it
happens it's gonna be fine because
there's nothing you can do about Rogaine
I always get the Rogaine now rubbing
still the thing do people use that for
the work I'm given verb would you use it
like if it was guaranteed to work no
come because I even when I had hair like
I did not I didn't get haircuts in
place you know like I would mostly cut
it myself yeah I don't care that much
the cost of Rogaine if it were if it was
worked a hundred percent yet you know it
would be incredibly expensive sure I say
just grow older the way that you're
supposed to the way you naturally do
this is what rage rage not a little life
I'm sure I'm quite sure that I forgot
what I was gonna say just yeah I'm sure
it wasn't good
oh yeah right you're right I miss primal
I would spend all the sub money on hair
plugs
no do hair plugs ever look natural I
probably they did they would have been
better broken and then Grogan's been
around longer than hair plugs you sure
know what we're making hair plug jokes
in the 80s yeah I feel like row gains
been around longer than me that's no
game it's like a 90s thing that's gonna
have a Hair Club for Men commercials oh
that's right
I don't know yeah I want to say bye I
want to say like the Hair Club for Men
has been around since
now it was actually the first club the
first Enders ever a club for anything
yeah it was the hair clip from a bunch
of a bunch of cavemen hang around
pointing to the head the first club for
anything was actually a club that
cavemen with huge yeah absolutely
that was that was can you imagine being
the first person in human existence to
start to go bald unless you met that
must a bad night the fuck is this
no one else in your tribe is looking at
you funny uh yes I can
he's not worried about where his teeth
point you know just you know don't worry
about anything I don't like I don't like
it when people die their hair yeah oh my
god like if you go gray let it go age
gracefully and this is what I'm saying
don't worry about no nips no tucks just
let it hang that's what I gotta say but
it did take me a while to get there you
know obviously I was forced to cousin in
town you people can't see but I'm a
party guy
so what's what's going wrong now what's
going on man out there nothing's going
wrong there are nothing's I mean yeah I
did just hear someone who's just saying
that you know they could have probably
built this for you and they probably
could have I'm not listening anything oh
this take your time make sure you do it
right yeah Rich's my business it's fun I
never said this would be quick nah I'm
really glad this is this is interesting
fuckin live fun everybody's fine but
dick the birthday boy is being funny he
says stop you're building the entire PC
upside down yeah what's the work true
just the image on your monitor would be
upside down
well you just trying to murder our set
down okay that's an easy fix that is an
easy fix
um oh I did not talk about steam
broadcasting yet rich did you see that
news today no steam is now offering its
own quasi streaming service okay in
which you can broadcast the game you are
currently playing on Steam and any one
of your friends can watch you play on
Steam without the use of another
third-party app yeah did present she
only had one if you wanted friends
really
well that's shut about our problem yeah
I think it's great I think there are
people who will use that and enjoy it I
don't think that we'll do that because
we kind of like out which works seaboard
for us so I think we're gonna stick with
Totino's lawyer oh oh thank you for
subscribing or are you serving us with
papers go after Tim and Eric before us
those bastards listen I I have a ton of
friend requests in steam and I can't I
don't have any slots left available why
do they do that where you can only have
somebody I don't know
excuse my money on their carts oh really
I think most reasonable people just use
it for multiplayer friends yeah and you
don't need 300 you know yeah we're we're
the weirdos yeah so we're we're using
we're you know it's not really what it
was designed for yeah and I am having a
concern here my fans all have these
little big three holes for the pins yeah
all fan pins on the motherboard had four
I don't know if you just put them on
three of them more if I'm supposed to
find some kind of adapter or what okay
really charges
yeah you're right Raj we like we bought
the computer on a budget it's still nice
price you know like is that a good price
point
things like RAM and SSDs like we can
upgrade that later something I ran this
Thomas yep and eight gigs
yeah a kick that's right it's funny
funny Ram are you doing a Larry can you
get more RAM yes
that's not no then what you have isn't
enough more is available get more listen
to Jay rich you get the most you can get
and then you get a little bit more in
case you can get more later
that's what should you RAM is like the
absolute easiest thing that's upgrade
now even I don't want install more rail
oh you know they have a very important
question rich are you concerned about
being part of the piece seat about being
part of the PC gaming mustard race what
best sign worthy of comment like my
dream I thought it was funny test late I
thought you guys were clever hey I used
to think we had some really clever fans
to be there he wasn't a subscriber J dr.
J recently turned it into turned off a
subscriber only mode and that was not as
okay
pretty sure these go on the last three
sections I don't know
I don't know I'm doing it I'm doing it I
do it this is when the Splosion happens
yeah this might be oh god
because this one tapped in here that
fences just extra pan out to the side
fit yeah it fits in the little Lulu's
this little plastic little wick can fix
there's a plastic thing on top of thins
that slides in okay so I'm just going to
assume I'm doing this right even though
I'm not good it's great
what the fuck on yes mark Besson thank
you for subscribing we very much
appreciate it I clicked on a finger
prize shit
that's fine next one I keep clicking on
your links I didn't know what that last
one meant it was a bunch of computer
gobbledygook
no yeah his bone his own design yes what
does that mean which FDD did you get
what's a DD what's an f DD do they mean
STD that's a thing right
yes DP SS penis SSD okay I know what an
SSD is I don't know what an F F F DD
okay how you guys talking about what is
that rich the heart breathlessly
solid-state Parker just this is the SSD
okay it was very important to the chat
that rich get the solid state drive okay
instead of a regular old spinning hard
drive this has to be amazing
all right you don't Joe how much storage
this SSDs that would you want to guess
uh one gig 120 good guys gigabytes okay
does that sound like DJ not a lot yeah
yeah but they're like but that's because
it's new and they're it's a newer
technology and it's not advanced they
are many many times faster yeah
yes and rich still does have his regular
old hard drive as well I'm going to end
it in here - yes it can operate with
both of them can you get that multiple
hard drive sugar pure
maybe you can't with Mack I don't know
no you can't with me okay okay okay
Lucas adults ow I I wonder if you can
with a BC I've no idea doctor killed a
cat says his dad wants help tuba once my
dad wants to build a gaming computer and
he keeps asking me for help but I don't
know what's your advice so I'm doing
something look it up on the Internet oh
yeah do some research do some research
there there are literally thousands of
resources online go go read it they have
subreddits dedicated to building your
own PC websites giving you lists of
things that you can buy all at one place
it's fine everything's going to be fine
yeah then the octo days right so the
solid-state drive home from the
operating system and like the apps okay
and then you know you put all your needs
yeah on the regular old speedy drives
like a goof
I have put my media on the computer's
internal drive and so long everything is
on external drive mmm-hmm did you buy
that static wristband or did that come
with your with your tool kit I've had
this so long I don't remember where I
got it I think like if you go to New
Ager to go to places like that that sell
like computer repair kits usually a
static wristband will come with the kids
I think I've had this since I build my
first one so it's been a while we'll
show you the graphics card everybody
settled down that's coming down will
show you all the goods man gonna be
great itself it's all free sorry okay
well hey c-3po tato yep you have fun
with that spunky is a great game it's
one of my favorites you will waste so
many hours on that day
now I'll click in because the screws too
far up unless your spy you supposed to
maybe anything walk up oh yeah yeah this
is how I want you go to the back that's
very different always go in the back

anything before I put all your empty
boxes mm-hmm the graphics card oh one
milady oh that's it that's going to make
all sorts of pretty pictures you could
do like Photoshop on that it's gonna I
need you to photo shops on this what is
that is that thing a camera it takes

a side camera it's a one megapixel well
gas-station hanging I can neither
confirm or deny that it's your 22nd
birthday but if it is you know way to
not die for another year you did great
keep up the good work keep up the good
work well rich has one excuse not to
solo stream now we're next thing we have
to figure out is rich is piss-poor
internet gaming yeah
yeah the Rob Roy thank you for
subscribing we very much appreciate it
thank you for subscribing to rich Evans
might not fuck up comically fancy I
don't know it broke okay my god look at
that
did you show the camera your show show
them all the angles rich oh look at that
dan I'm going to assume they're hip
enough yeah but they know where it is
what's all them outputs I'm gonna have
to read just show me them outputs touch
oh I got there I got that is DVI huh
another DVI yeah I means I'm swimming
dessert HDMI 110 HDMI yes yes horror
looks weird maybe it's not what perfect
way to do yeah yeah this one's doing
them I've never seen that one is that
like an HDMI mini or isaac Ferrer and
once itís oh I didn't know what the
fuck that is
I don't either oh there's a they're
saying is it just a display port display
port that's what they're saying what the
fuck is a display ports I don't know I
wanna be high something I don't know
what the fuck that is
okay I'm sure it's some sort of
connection that is probably better than
other connections for some reason or way
worse for different reasons
oh we got more opera hold on yeah I'm
fixing it
that was the marriage of figaro no good
my knees are well cuz it's good thing
yeah and if we're talking and they're
singing that's distracting
I understand DisplayPort
port yep it's true
plugs are the power in before you plug
it in what I guess it's going to be hard
to get apps or easy to damage if I don't
I watched it
I'm just reading what they're writing
yeah let me set this aside briefly I
shouldn't do that at the edge of the
table
um Questers fest thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it if someone is
asking a very important question jack
which blanket is my favorite rlm the
answer is yes the the answer is
sometimes
oh sure what this comes with a poster
coming Rafic scream what hey my grandpa
turn comes with this poster okay great
does everybody can know I've got us buff
looking dude on my wall because of my
video card livid liquid is saying plug
the power into the video card before you
plug the card into I don't know I knew
I'm going to I don't want to
I got a modular power supply here I
gotta find the right cord fishing okay
do it
and I'm just kind of cleaning up so I
can find the shit easy I got books I got
ads I got disks that's great I got so
much shit you got shit for days I guess
we all do that's true it's true we got
that was a poop joke you know what I
think each each point it is its own
unique places you know every think it
has its own yeah we um they all have
their own unique charm okay I love all
plinkus equally except for animated play
here which I don't much care for but
that is not that's not an uncommon
reaction right telegin it be more
specific with your question telegin is
asking for camcorder recommendations for
first of all I don't think they're
called camcorders secondly what will you
be using it for film the stuff obviously
well but I mean for one that's the real
question
an adapter I think usually when people
ask me for recommendations unlike for
like filming stuff in there they're just
getting into it I always tell them the
same thing use your phone that's not a
joke no sure I mean yeah your cell phone
has a better video camera on it than any
of us hands down that's true
um stick figs thank you for subscribing
we very much appreciate it so yeah if
you're just getting started out yeah if
you're just starting out like everything
you make is going to suck yeah so don't
invest a lot of money in something nice
when you're starting out yes learn what
you're doing first and upgrade gear as
you get better
absolutely seems to be the best thing
you can do absolutely just I don't know
what kind of pores is power
Oh Neil nope opera I caught it this time
oh you know this is string sextant
number two Oh in g-baby yeah I think
like you know like especially if you're
doing stuff like sketch comedy or making
dumb Internet videos use your phone sure
use your phone edit it in it whatever
free editing software yeah figure out
whether you like it before you spend
money on it octo James these are the
chords I want right I'm just
double-checking everything cuz I don't
want to fuck up oh and AK door
interrupted thank you for subscribing we
appreciate it
nd Oh someone is that going to click the
mouse Rach
oh that's a shame my ninjas discussion
you can use old SLR lenses for DSLRs you
just need to make sure you have the
proper adapter but like usually like any
old Panasonic camera will work with new
digital Panasonic dr. Jason yes but I
have some Canon lenses that
my Panasonic deals alarms I had to get
the adapter yeah but you can find
adapters for incredibly cheap on eBay or
anywhere oh sure but if you use and
non-digital lens on your digital camera
you won't and this should be obvious
River you won't get it get any of the
automated functions like you've got a
little focus you won't get zoom function
facial recognition which is fun
and that is right
but now they're saying 20 minutes later
on today is gonna say no use different
Cooper does he might he might I didn't
go talk about student comes and whatnot
and livid liquid is saying oh and you
got to get a shot from inside the fridge
your movie has to start with someone
waking up to an alarm clock absolutely
and then they go over the kitchen and
they in the of the shot from inside the
fridge if that's how you have to start
your film well or I'll brought it just
from inside anything everybody at one
point has done that yeah put your camera
in the oven in the fridge in the trunk
yep something has opened and you thought
it was really cool that you thought to
put your camera inside yes are you
required to in your student film black
got the blanket of gotcha yeah either
cuts a black and a gunshot orbs Oliver
that is it to run up both can you do
both no cuz if you cut the black and a
gunshot you can't follow that up with it
was on a dream
well wake up from a dream then cut to
black gunshot or vice versa cut to black
gunshot credits post credits wake up it
was oh no that crazy talk
no post credits this isn't a Marvel
movie this is an art film
they all got him now maybe the student
films are trying to emulate Marvel
movies now
oh god maybe maybe maybe you know it's
been a while since we've been in our
school new there's just a whole batch of
student films yeah
they haven't after the credits sequence
nobody makes experimental films anymore
everybody just tries to make Marvel
movies like it
yes an interesting question
they said they were thinking about
getting a daddy okay did you find it
hard to get it um this will be a tough
question for us Oh God because when we
were editing first we tape the tape yeah
yeah let's think I started editing out
of one camcorder into a VCR yeah through
but out of one camcorder into a sound
mixer out of the sound mixer into the
VCR so yeah I learned to edit that way
which is the most frustrating horrible
thing ever so when I finally started
using nonlinear it was the most amazing
thing and I loved everything about it so
it wasn't like frustrating to me at all
um as far as like learning the specifics
of how to use it I don't really remember
hmm I just know I was excited that I was
not getting rainbow edits because I was
not pausing the VCR finding my shot
I don't wanna sure so I I don't remember
yeah and I want to say my first editing
experience was on one of the earlier
final cuts yeah we had it we had to go
to my school and we had like a little AV
clapping school and I found that to be
incredibly frustrating because so many
technical problem yeah but yeah my first
nonlinear was premiere oh really and I
know I learned it pretty quick I learned
it on my own I didn't like ask people or
like someone showed me how to use this I
just learned from doing which I always
think is the best way absolutely um but
I don't remember how long it took to
learn it's I get I think to answer your
question the answer is yes it's hard to
get into that's why not many people do
it um yes the matter of getting the hang
of it finding your groove whatever the
the real thing you need to do is make
something yes and then you'll know
whether you like it or not I will say I
tried to use once a couple years ago
I was visiting home from that thing for
Christmas or Easter or something and my
younger brother was trying to show me
how to use Windows Movie Maker and it
was so simple that I could not wrap my
brain around it I could not I could not
figure out how to use it because it was
too simple yeah so I don't know if
that's like I can't even say like maybe
start with one of the you know free ones
and learn how to use that and then work
out like I don't even know because I
could not bring my brain around Windows
Movie Maker but nothing about any system
after having edited on professional
editing software for years that's always
something that we toyed with in the in
the early Funny or Die days is we would
always talk about like making a free
movie yeah
like using cell phones editing in like
I'm moving share exporting that way and
like how much could you make doing it
for free
yeah not paying for anything including
editing software lights microphones
right right it never got around because
we're all used to the goods because cuz
why I do that right laughter yeah
that's a good I wonder what it would be
like to edit something like but here but
also here's the real thing because of
I'm gonna pimp my editing software of
choice which is premier and the Adobe
suite because the Adobe suite has
Creative Cloud now you can get premiere
After Effects Photoshop Prelude audio
editing software for like 50 bucks for
one month yeah put down 50 bucks get it
all that's the professional stuff you
could use it all and if you don't like
it that's only 50 bucks gone yeah that's
true and if you do like it another 50
bucks for the next month and hope you
can hurt a 50 bucks somehow
make make a make a corporate video for
it you can earn 50 bucks by you and make
your video you edit your video and you
sell your video to youtube you sell to
you sell it to youtube and then you make
your 50 bucks for the next month
absolutely okay what so now I think you
need to make something on cell phones
using I mean I for the longest time
because we have a couple VHS camcorders
here the longest time I've been thinking
about the idea of shooting an on VHS and
editing VCR to VCR that used to do
because I became an expert like because
there's always that delay when you have
like your recording and you pause it
pause the record to find your next shot
or whatever done when you unpause it
there's a couple second delay before it
starts recording so you've got to get
that down and I got really really good
at it so I'm sorry to miss this I am
nostalgic nostalgic for because I grew
up with it I definitely don't miss it um
but I would be curious as an exercise to
go back and try and do something like
that again yeah I don't know if I ever
will who knows
oonh you know who knows the shadow I've
thought about the idea of just shooting
even if I wouldn't edit it that way I
probably wouldn't but shooting something
a short film or something on VHS sure
and making it look like because I have a
fondness for the the awkward period of
direct video movies when people were
shooting on video like the shot on video
direct-to-video movies there's some good
ones out there but it has a completely
different look to it the you know a
traditional even direct-to-video movie
shot on film like all the phones and
stuff was shot on film oh there's some
stuff that we shot a video and it's so
bizarre like well I mean I recreate that
look now it's it's as easy as like no
shooting on video and then you can just
you know import the footage yes editor
happen point with AHS yeah
yeah it's it's very different now and I
mean I remember I remember those early
days of finally I want to say I've
started editing on Final Cut for real
okay is what we had and there were so
many technical problems with importing
footage from DV tapes oh yeah that the
audio in the video would get out of sync
every single time no matter no matter
what you did and so then every five
seconds you'd have to splice the audio
only and move it over three four hours I
can splice the audio only movement I
never I never went through that
experience that sounds horrible
yeah well it was incredibly frustrating
but I mean that's how you learned that
sim and if you can make it over that
learning curve then you just keep going
yeah you start with the worst case
scenario as far as what your setup is or
how your editing then you slowly work
your way up you're here right Jack's
life story is just technical
difficulties starting with that failed
condom this is Jay I want to say that
you didn't care about film school
because of experimentalism being over
talk
what kind of teachings were they doing
uh they weren't teaching anything
technical that was my problem yeah my
guy actually at the time I wasn't as
open-minded about experimental film
there was some stuff I liked but now I'm
more open to it but I wanted to learn
the nuts and bolts of film make sure
that's what I went there for but it was
all just like express yourself and you
know it wasn't anything that was helpful
nothing helpful as far as like you know
editing or or shot composition or it was
so loose
I hated it is that because it's a sham
yes if I gone to school like Columbia
Chicago I i definitely were stuck with
it because that's all about the
technical aspects you know the
filmmaking right express yourself
film what's in your heart how do I film
it how do I load the film into the
camera to shoot what's in my heart
but what be those things no no no if
it's strong enough in your heart the
other stuff will just happen you went to
the special snowflake school yes yeah
yeah yeah that happens sometimes I don't
know what the department is like now but
time yeah it was incredibly frustrating
a little bit ago your hardest filming I
shouldn't tell um sorry I I can tell you
that it's probably very similar okay
yeah yeah I knew I never went to film
school and so I just started making
stuff yeah so yeah I learned so much
more after leaving film school when it
was just shooting things all the time
absolutely I learned so much more from
that from that yeah there's like a four
year period where it was like I was
making and not just shorts cuz everybody
makes shorts try and make a feature it
may not turn out good it won't turn out
it won't turn out good there's a reason
you don't see any of my old features
anywhere on the Internet are not good
but they were great experiences they're
great learning experiences that was my
film school it was just making stuff
non-stop for like four years do me
something I have to do someone do
anything what do you do
they only gave me three SAT a corpse
I've got some old ones out there the red
they're red yeah just just grab them
wait am i jack they're in this box all
right we're in the box I'm in the box
goblin for my room pure Brown another
thing now they're gonna have to find
your old features this was pre-internet
people you can't yeah you don't want to
see them trust me you don't want to and
you probably can no he can't
they're not anywhere there was a time
before the Internet yeah when everything
wasn't available to everyone all the
time
yes it was a strange time it was a dark
time the only film from that era that
has seen any sort of release is gorilla
interruptive yeah because that one still
has terms in an odd way and it has an
interesting backstory but everything
else yeah these experiences of his
learning experiences that's all it needs
to be yep you must do and when you do
you'll fail yes then you must fail to
learn and then hopefully you fail up yes
yeah that's the that's the idea yeah
nail upwards hmm
oh I have a I have an important answer
to this question someone is saying Jack
how old do you think the average age of
this chat is now the answer is I don't
care also I think I think young I guess
I think you shoe I'm gonna guess it
varies quite a bit it's probably fair
varies quite a bit but I mean I just
assume everyone's younger than the a - I
guess is that I'm gonna say 20 - sure no
now we're just gonna started I shouldn't
have said that because now it's just
gonna be like an age sex location it
really doesn't matter they will get
there they don't know what it was
there you are assuming you know what age
they are getting rich because you know
what it doesn't matter mister glitch
thank you for subscribing we appreciate
everything is hooked up oh yeah
hooked up incuse yeah it varies widely
they're all saying they're all same very
you know I don't know I guess they're
all lying they're 15 usually I ask where
people are here there's one 65 year old
guy who's skewing the numbers up 15 yeah
yeah yeah we just take your god things
tiny what
oh so it's over oh no this one same time
and see if they start and that's really
the this is this is it so you build it
and then it's just built and then that's
it well then you get to use it what do
you want Jay I want a grand finale
fireworks you want too much I do
tella god no I don't I've never heard of
being nostalgic chick so the answer is
no I've never watched her I can only
assume that's related to the nostalgia
critic I've heard of that one I've never
been enough but I've heard of that yes
check the earth there are what the
stings oh we had a music I don't I don't
I have him I didn't I didn't sit out of
