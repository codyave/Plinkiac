let's see here Bongo Doug says Jack yeah
you are a wonderful father that works
tirelessly for his family and our
genuine entertainment all the while
working hard in your own business thank
you so much Jack riches okay too I guess
welcome I do what I can
oh yeah Megan I'm making different and
good stuff for you
yes chat Batman has Jets coming out of
his ass that's true that's what I'm
saying is it's lazy screenwriting
it's lazy screenwriting and a director
who doesn't care
Oh Bayonetta and her spanking it's
fantastic Jedi would never torture my
kids on YouTube I've been i-i've been
kind of paying attention to that that
that YouTube family they they they make
prank videos but it's to parents and
they prank their kid every prank video
on YouTube is fake no no they're
pranking their kids and their kids are
like crying in them
and they they like they they've been
getting in a lot of heat a lot of heat
because I got eggs good I'm far I'm very
skeptical of a lot of YouTube prank
videos absolutely like any any sort of
like hidden cam man on the street yeah
yeah 100% faked but this is this is like
like parents tricking their children and
like I said I've only been kind of
paying attention to it and it from from
the outside it looks awful how hundred
one wacky kid joke there yep but that
wasn't pranking them
I jumped the pranks are traumatic shit
and emotional abuse that's what it looks
like that's definitely what it looks
like let's see here
sorry gents is part one of two zelda
caffeine excited again that's art what
do you think the new story will be my
friend thinks it'll be a flashback
10,000 years ago other friends think
it's a new region of map that will be
added i would hope a new region the map
but we'll see yeah if they want to be
lazy though yeah they can just end it
how long was how long was link sleeping
for 100 years 100 years so I won't be
10,000 years gonna be a flashback to a
hundred years ago this might guess well
then they might be assuming we're gonna
get the origin of some of the machines
oh I'm just thinking like what Oh a
giant frog I'm thinking what would what
would be easiest to put into the map and
you just say up it's a hundred years ago
this is a link night trial it's a user
he's becoming the night Hyrule this is a
night trial hundred we got it they gotta
add in a dungeon yeah but something just
come out of the ground of course that
can come under ground anyway I'm not a
hard person sure what they're gonna do
that's right I'm not I'm not too worried
about it we'll find out when it comes
out mm-hmm let's see here also what the
others say - I can't wait for Chase or
for case four yes Phoenix Wright case
four it's a great story industry don't
burn yourselves out though well it's
like we we know like their heat like the
other issue is there are people that
really like the voice streams and there
are also people that really hate the
voice stream are those I there there's
there's dissenters and so we do try to
to pace ourselves with those
defeat all enemies using a single combo
Oh No
I don't have anywhere near enough oh I
don't have to do one big combo I just
have to keep hitting this is encouraging
me to spam them
wait looks if you got hit so you into
become yeah yeah people keep it
alright alright
the dissenters are objectively right I
like the voice dreams is what I'd say I
were like them but I also read and
moderate the comments like I there are
people who don't like the voice frames
but I'm not going to listen to them
because I like the voice dreams but also
it's like for rich and I doing the
voices it's tough so we would paste them
out usually let's see here Anonymous's I
have a suggestion for a game
unfortunately it's along the lines of
frog fractions how can I get you to play
it without spoiling I don't understand
what to do here you just need to keep
hitting them and not get hit and not
into your combo or just give up or just
give up
either email or email us at a at a
prereq at red letter media with the
title of the of the game or Twitter it
at us at previously rec so kill them all
with one company but the combos as I
know what are short things were
relatively short things yyy xx YY X you
know yeah well but those are the combos
but there's your like combo meter which
just keeps track of how many times it
like how many times you can
consecutively hit something okay so you
have to keep that going that kind of
combo alright alright like accidentally
quit out entirely
oh whoa you can combo forever right all
right and when I think of combo I think
I'm like the hair weave like this this
is get you a hair weave right finisher
that's what I think of when you say
combo when this people are saying to use
the guns to excel got a combo so like if
you you know hit hit hit and then hold
down the gun to shoot at them then go
back to hit hit hit yep let's see here
gobbledygook says hey saw on another
stream that twitch has an option now for
different sub levels yes that is true
for 99 999 and $24.99 a month as a sub
and each tier allows new emotes and
rewards heard of this and any plans I
have heard of this I haven't looked into
it too much what is this for people who
subscribe to us yeah you know right now
it's kind of a flat five dollars right
five dollars a month and then you get
you know the use of the emo to get the
little pizza roll next your name twitch
has recently announced that they are
going to start with sub tiers
you got the $5 tier you got the $10 tier
and you have the $25
and then it's up to us as a channel to
determine what you get at those tier
levels I haven't looked into it too
deeply and I will be quite honest with
you as I don't know what we would offer
people but we will see we will see you
hack frauds got a stream every night if
you want my $25 right I don't really
want to do that and that's the thing
where it's like yeah we we stream twice
a week I'm kind of comfortable with the
whole $5 well yeah yeah so that's why I
haven't really looked into it that much
yep there's new tears of subbing twitch
is really pushing hard this whole
streamers get a cut of game sales
initiative where you can opt in and if
your game is available to purchase your
viewers can click a little button and go
to a store to buy the game and then us
and streamers get a little cut of it and
so I get emails all the time from twitch
be like hey this game right here is
available for your fans to purchase
maybe you want to play this game look
I'm looking at like tradition I'm my
personal definition of combo that I have
in my head yeah it's like your fighting
game kind of chi-x why to be here's the
uppercut that that's what I think of
sorry I'm sorry there's two different
kinds of combos rich and that's fine you
were thinking of a right combo but
let's see here Anonymous's United States
Canada Mexico Panama Haiti Jamaica Peru
Republic Dominican Cuba Carribean
Greenland El Salvador to Puerto Rico
Columbia Venezuela Honduras and Ghana
they just said that all these things huh
they just said all those things that
I've had their two ducks the buck to two
bucks they wanted to dog-sit
they paid two ducks to have me list
these countries animate oh is that the
Animaniacs country song United States
Canada Mexico Panama Haiti Jamaica Peru
Jamaica Peru Republic Dominica Cuba
Carribean Greenland El Salvador - for to
eat go Colombia Venezuela Honduras and
oh yeah I remember that
okay I get it I remember that okay
anonymous says you can continue your
combos while dodging while holding your
attack buttons while dodging it's
explained in a collectible in the first
game annoying because it can be
game-changing so you can hold your
attack button while dodging
interesting
there you go keep hitting people hip
can't let that timer run out
oh god sing there you go you hit him he
hit him
keep firing keep firing
nice rich nice yep
all right candy for crows hey Jack I
watched the Willy Wonka drummer video
fuck yes
what is this the I will have to we have
to remember for you to watch this later
it's someone who does a drum cover of a
scene from Willy Wonka okay so he does
drums to how people speak it's it's the
the scene at the end where Charlie and
Willy's and Charlie and Grandpa are in
Willie's office and he like does drums
to the dialogue of Willy Wonka and it is
a new art form as far as I'm concerned
it's amazing he also does one for It's
Always Sunny in Philadelphia yeah and it
is amazing it's like it feels like it
feels like a new form of jazz it's great
I think as an editor you love the 1001
movies before you die video by Jonathan
Cole on YouTube highly recommend ok 1001
movies before you die I will remember to
look that up thank you I'm not doing so
great though oh you got this bow hey now
you know the whole hold down the hold
down attack while dodging trick
maybe that'll help you can a streamer
block a viewer from seeing what they
stream I don't think so I think we can
block we can block people from chatting
definitely I don't think we can block
you from seeing what the streams yeah
streams are the YouTube videos are both
both there's no way to stop you it was
one guy shit I got sick of I just want
him gone
one person oh it's like both in the
comments here in the chat and in the
comment section like we can we can mute
someone and ban them where it's like we
just never see anything they say for the
rest of history mmm that's possible the
question is can we stop someone from
watching the stream and the answer is no
because like
like even if we could stop a signed-in
like if you sign into church count we
can stop then then you can just sign out
and still watch the stream because it's
a public stream so no yeah well but we
can ban people from chatting we can ban
people from the comments but yeah we
can't ban people from watching as we as
this is a public thing don't believe
we've banned many people no oh no I
think you know I think like when we
started there was like an initial wave
but no we don't really you know and of
course now we have our mods and so like
our Maz didn't get to deal with it ah
thank you Thank You moderators finally
we appreciate all the hard work you do
tell us more about the asshole in the
YouTube comments sometimes you guys
sometimes I don't get it but hey we're
not here to harsh on our commenters
little one she just called him little
one
uh yeah let's see here urban crisis is
rich yes do you have any tips for me on
XCOM - I'm having a rough time on
Ironman mode is it normal to have over
half of your soldiers injured at any
given time yes it is XCOM 2 is a bitch
that way what is it what's a quick tip
with a quick XCOM 2 tip rich get good
yeah III on the top of my hand and yeah
um well I'm in the middle of bayoneting
I don't I don't know that I can I can
just pull something out of my butt
that's like magical advice that's what
that's what they're looking for I can't
do that I've come to just reach up into
the butt pull it out it's just harder
than XCOM 1 which isn't one is the
reboot yeah yeah I I can't help you
nobody can help you nobody nobody can
else comes a heart those are tough games
tough games it pray to the rng gods
absolutely that's all you can do
sometimes
all right so what are we how are we
attacking here I don't know I don't know
overwatch more I've I've been playing a
little overwatch since the the new
events as some of those skins are really
cool but unfortunately I have not had a
ton of free time for overwatch play I
did play a little bit I use a game that
I was looking forward to him called the
signal from Torv oh that sounds familiar
oh I suggested it to you as yeah episode
1 I wasn't taking it you were digging it
and after playing for a couple hours I'm
no longer digging it it's it's it has
this really interesting present of
premise and I really like robots and
that's what this is is you're a robot
and you get to you get a little gun that
helps you control other robots and you
just have to go explore this area in its
first-person shooter and it seemed like
it was going to be interesting and it's
just really boring and I think that's
one of the selling points of the game is
like oh it's atmosphere and you know
figure out the mystery and it's not
really about shooting robots as oh I
just wanted to shoot robots so the
signal from Torv arrives I found I found
to be quite quite boring so
no the event you know what I want tour
bjørn's tour borne yarns beardless
events and I love that one and Mercy's
mercies a classic overwatch outfit is
fantastic I love her outfit so I really
want to cure Beorn's beard lifts skin
and I want Mercy's classic outfit kind
of not dig in this particular fight oh
one of these we've had fights like this
in the personal tour veau signal from
Torv oh the signal from Torbjorn
oh you just got like that's a neat skin
Mikey no he's a little bearded dwarf
character and in this one is like he
doesn't have a beard it's meat for which
it's a skin in overwatch ow
and it's a special skin that you can
only get during this event oh my god
on rich cares so much about overwatch
and I know that about him
signal from turbo gets nothing
oh maybe I'm saying it wrong hold on
dude I will check the signal oh good
baby this battle will stop sucking I've
got giant fucking wings now oh oh I'm
very sorry it's the signal from Tova tol
VA the signal from Tova I misspoke
is dwarf a politically correct term yes
using it derogatory way it's a technical
term I was going to say yeah it's just a
technical term yeah
Wharf dwarfism is the condition I think
midget is the word that that people
don't like you to use anymore you know
or is it supposed to be little person
and I've always found little person to
be incredibly demeaning it's like a
person but little like and I guess that
is like that also makes sense but I
can't keep on I can't keep up and does
it matter no it does not matter
I think people would take offense to
munchkin yeah munchkin is probably
offensive they call the doughnuts munch
munch khun's at Dunkin Donuts and they
stop calling them that lycra doughnut
holes yeah oh those are cute that's cute
and they're still called munchkins I
don't know it has been a while since
I've been to Dunkin Donuts
it might matter if you note and that's
you know what that's the thing about
anything politically correct is nothing
really matters unless your friend tells
you not to say it so if you have a
friend who is a dwarf or a little person
or whatever then ask them you know how
you would how they would prefer to be
called and they'll probably just say
Jeff coming Jeff if your dwarf friend's
name is Jeff because if their name is
Jerry that's not they just prefer to
call Jeff I will see their that's why -
why just listen to the people around you
shit people are saying the the tiny
doughnuts I still felt munchkins yes
okay that's important that's important
to know important to know we're going to
leave off
vos drea 15 says I've got the easiest
game oh no I'm sorry
Australia says hey guys just want to let
you know that I appreciate you guys
doing these streams I have been
suffering under some pretty hard anxiety
attacks and the streams both live and
saved help me cope hey thanks for
watching we're happy we can help in any
way it could be worse right is that is
that what you get out of it they way
they want Justin go Oh at least I'm not
these assholes I got that going for me
I'm not a hopeless schmuck ah I'm
terrible this I like this better than
the surfing portion right
okay anonymous says I've got the easiest
game of fuck marry kill don't want to
get into that siren Animus what's your
favorite Lord of the Ring movie and
favorite aspect of each of the movies
that's a question we yeah they're just
they go here do this I don't like those
movies that much yeah yeah now we're
going over here now we're going over
there now with Fayed Mitch yeah I like
it you know what I'm a sucker for the
first one for Fellowship of the Rings
beginning you know meet all the
characters you start your epic journey
you got your giant fire monster what is
his the Balrog or whatever his name was
there's a lot of great spectacles yeah I
mean in all of them but I like I like
the first one best you know you know
what I like about the first one is the
whole Boromir turn I liked his bed
Jeffery uh or Sean
the actor who dies and everything he's
in Sean Bean Sean Bean is Boromir night
I think so I mean and I like all of my
like all free movies but I think I think
fellowship gets it for me followed by
number two then number three gets a
little bat shit Sean Bean thank you yes
Sean Bean those movies are all just a
lot of shit happening huh those movies
are all just a lot of shit happening
yes it's an epic adventure there should
be a lot of shit happening the plot
structure is fight the elves fight the
eggs blood spiders shoot the fish you
love them up we go they're going on an
adventure I'm so I'm so it's just a lot
of shit happens I oh I'm sorry that
pretty much actual an adventure in the
action-adventure movie rich I just you
know I just didn't like all the fantasy
you don't none of those giant fucking
birds and fly to the mountain I just
didn't I just thought it was like it was
you know they were like elves and
hobbits and magical set up
fucking internet connection there are
magical creatures and I just thought
this is not a very realistic movie
that's true the Zaius bayonetta is a lot
of shit happening yes but it's a video
game and I'm fine with it
I'm sure there was a very specific
reason they couldn't use the birds
I'm sure yes I'm sure Sauron had
anti-aircraft missiles that was a
deleted scene rich if you watch the
extended version you would have seen him
setting up his anti-aircraft missiles
that were only disabled at the end
that's why the Third's could come and
say proto um Jack rich says anonymous
shit
all right anonymous um
metal admit tap kick stay yellow Turkey
file productive laborer plane handsomely
noiseless edition dear plastic Mail zip
agreeable frightened I did the PayPal's
you said the thing actually liked that
one the randomness is random I guess I
got I just got mad no no I just I
enjoyed that that was that was enjoyable
nonsense so I appreciate that
anonymous I'm trying I'm trying to
articulate my Lord of the Rings thing
better oh sorry good now I'm trying to I
don't just doesn't do it for me man and
I'll tell you like usually I'm not big
on fantasy set in that in that realm you
know like with elves and dwarves and
hobbits is and you know all that fantasy
dragon II shit usually I'm not into that
but Lord of the Rings is like the the
exception
but I could see someone just not being
into it because it's that kind of
fantasy you know knights and Dragons
it's not like I've never liked that kind
of fantasy it just was just dry oh I was
a noob I mean I'm in doing I'm stealing
now we got to fight a bunch of orcs now
I got a kill but I don't get it I don't
get a jack they're doing a grand big
they're doing a big thing they're
reading the world of evil rich a lot of
fighting when you rid the world of evil
are you back off right when I activate
the stupid thing let's see here a a jet
a a jelly 96 is good evening half two
here in UK Oh half two here in UK
decided to tip you only God knows why
guess I should ask a question have you
guys streamed the latest hit man yet
think it'd be a good choice for the
stream you know I've only played one of
the hitman games ever yeah
have you played any hitman talked about
this before the original okay I think
I've only played a little bit of the
original trying I'm trying not to die oh
sure no you keep dying
uh we'd be down I'm okay with playing a
hitman game I got nothing against the
hitman game no I don't either I played
the first one the only one I played okay
and I played it with a computer that
wasn't quite up to the task
oh sure sure and it would take some of
the fucking levels I swear to God like
half an hour to fucking load you know
and if you would die and fail ha ha ha
it would not to reload the entire
fucking level again and it was just
fucking unplayable of course unless I
had all day to play for 15 minutes
that's some incentive though not to die
oh yeah oh yeah you took your fucking
time yeah yeah but I would like just
shit what wrong should happen and I'd
say I'll fucking turn it off yeah they
couldn't do it I was liking what I saw
hmm but
loyd beat says Jack little nightmares
comes out tomorrow
nice little nightmares again was that
the the like hide from the horrible
things game little nightmares that
sounds really familiar hold on little my
oh yes little nightmares looks like a
weird little game maybe will stream that
one us up I don't know it reminds me a
little bit of something like like inside
where it looks like it's mostly kind of
like platforming puzzle solving but it
looks is like it's set in a really
creepy world yeah so I'm interested in
little nightmares that comes out
tomorrow that's great
oh and it's the new game from the inside
limbo limbo people oh well fuck then
actually that makes me not want to play
it a little bit yeah
captain jerk says this fight is a little
bloated yeah you get some of these
fights in the first Bayonetta two words
like the the boss has 20 health bars
that you need to get down
yeah rich is doing some great dodges
here though say that way fuck up one
well that should have been one
fucking die hahahaha
alright you did it you did it rich
what did you do uh almost a Basic
Instinct Oh the classic got to keep it
racy but not too racy that's her whole
stick of course of course that's her
whole stick let's see here Mike chase
gaming says thoughts on this odd hyper
consumerism sounding surrounding nerd
culture this is something very different
from selling Star Wars dolls says Mike
chase gaming like get specific what do
you mean what is it you don't like what
is it that you can't ignore well and if
I'll tell I'll try to keep an eye out
for your name in the chat Mike chase
gaming I believe he's just talking about
like I would just like everything is for
sale now yeah and I get I guess I just
don't think it is very different than
selling Star Wars dolls you know like
it's kind of the same fucking deal
there's just more of them now right you
know like what are we looking for that's
that's offensive that's bothersome huh
with the nerd culture right that's the
thing where it's like if you don't want
to buy it don't buy it
right I've just I just want something
more specific to answer and I'm looking
for him I'm looking for Mike chase
gaming in the chat right now like do I
think nerd boxes are stupid yes but I
just don't buy them right like loot
crate dumbest thing in the world always
has been agreed
I just don't buy it right it just
doesn't pop and then it doesn't bother
me right and you know like things like
nerd items nerdy t-shirts Funko dolls
they are selling to the audience that is
available and right now there are a ton
of people who are into nerdy things who
have disposable incomes so these just
you sell what people buy I think these
things like the Funko pops I don't even
get because they're just ugly right they
are the ugliest fucking thing scissor
awful awful so overpriced I don't get it
I honestly don't get it I'm with you
rich and are they stupid yeah so
anything you can do about it no just
just don't don't buy them yeah you make
fun of them make fun of my a lot don't
blame the sellers blame the buyers I'm
with you poop dick that's that's exactly
it if nobody would buy them they would
stop selling them but hey you make you
make you money where you can man shout
I'm sorry I scared your mom
I'm sorry scared here ma I shouted
fucking die okay oh okay I don't know if
their mom thought there was like an
intruder in the house oh yeah what kind
of movie are you watching my voice
fucking carries Jack always has always
will rich do you want you out of this no
no I don't I need a break
no problem you know what we might have
to call it soon because I think it's
gonna start raining oh really yes this
is cloudy now
yeah rains gonna start in a little bit
did you take it by ear fuck yeah I biked
you you need a ride home well if it
rains a lot I might if it's just a
little rain I can make it alright
alright alright fun oh yeah when I get
through the through the tips and then
we'll see how we're feeling alright I
just did the very least I just need a
break oh sure
oh let's see what we got some intense
action action
zack of the axes says dungeons and
dragons with rich Evans why do I need to
fight all these orcs as they burn down
the tavern he's sitting in that would be
a game and I could probably deal with
that Lord of the Rings they fighting the
or because the orcs have been like you
know harassing local village and the
villagers need help so you know they
just we got to get to this area and
there are to this area will fight the
orcs yeah they're on a journey like
they're not they're not it's a dull
fucking journey they're not legless it's
wait it goes on for way too fucking long
you know what they don't have cars they
gotta walk it still takes a while let's
see here anonymous says if you were
forced to spend 48 hours with a famous
male actor who would it be
that's the core there cuz there's
alright alright myself so I can have a
fucking just a calm night chill out you
wouldn't want to just touch chat with
someone like do what say what hmm
no I thought yeah you're in them Depp
movie yeah that's kind of that's good
for you man yeah yeah where I guess
where are you spending this 48 hours I'm
not I'm not a social butterfly right
yeah
it all depends on where like if you're
trapped in a room with nothing to do and
you just have to stare at them or talk
to them for 48 hours try to find someone
interesting what like I'm found Star
Trek The Next Generation yeah fuck am I
gonna say to Patrick Stewart I like that
show you around yeah but you know what
you're trapped in it you're trapped in a
place with for 48 hours or at least
Patrick Stewart would have some stories
to tell you right what what makes you
think he wants to talk to me they're
saying you're trapped he's like all of a
sudden like you you you okay you're in
an elevator and you just happen to be in
an elevator with Sir Patrick Stewart and
the power goes out he was he was at a TV
show I love 20 years ago you know I
respect that I leave them the fuck alone
no but they're saying you have to be
trapped with someone like whoa boom like
you're trapped in an elevator at least
it should be someone you can talk to and
if you're trapped in an elevator with
Sir Patrick Stewart it's really possible
he's gonna have some nice weed on him
and so then that'll pass the time well
nuts look just do me any good
something's gotta pass the time right
you guys I'm gonna that just means I'm
gonna have to deal with some fucking
secondhand smoke yeah but I don't want
to deal with highest fuck Patrick
Stewart that's what you gotta deal with
but like I said at least you could tell
you some nice stories and that'll pass
the time well get high he'll tell you
some stories and you'll have a good
laugh rich rich has the inability to
play along no he has the ability to give
you an honest answer
don't you want to meet so-and-so oh not
really if I'm gonna be trapped in a box
with someone for 48 hours I would I
would want it to be someone I could
either hold a conversation with her have
some fun with yeah so he knows all I'm
saying so you know like that like that
Will Ferrell he said he's a quality dude
I could chat with him for two days okay
boom why is rich such a huge square you
guys were just called rich cool like an
hour ago where did that go you went from
you went from the radical dude to square
as because you don't want to get high
with Sir Patrick Stewart yeah hung out
with Patrick Stewart we're trapped in an
elevator
he couldn't get away from me it's really
awkward because I don't know him at all
and and so and so I spent 48 hours
getting to know another human being and
having a really great conversation how
could they try to talk to him a few
times there's just like a lot of really
awkward silence it's cool sure he was he
a gentleman rich he is a knight he is
knighted he would be a gentleman to you
I'm anonymous rich yep Jack so people
would compare The Hobbit trilogy
similarly to the Star Wars prequels in
quality so we're gonna go back well
answer this first and we'll go back
would you agree or is that just a little
dramatic thank you for the internet
level
The Hobbit being as bad as the Star Wars
prequels in comparing no I buy even for
one I didn't love the Lord of the Rings
movie I haven't seen any of the Hobbit
films because I don't give a fuck okay
so I can't compare them and I certainly
wouldn't compare the Lord of the Rings
films to the prequels no no it would be
the Lord of the Rings films would be the
original trilogy okay and then the
Hobbit I have not seen any of the Hobbit
films do they come out with the last one
ah yes I don't watch me not know you
know why cuz I know I mean and the
Hobbit movies aren't good but they're
nowhere near as bad as the prequel yeah
like it's just you know the ala Hobbit
movies are bloated a bloated experience
instead of terrible movies so I'm sorry
you were gonna go back to Sir Patrick
Stewart does it have to be an actor well
neil degrasse tyson he counts you would
count you know the reason okay it says
famous male actor and neil degrasse
tyson acts in cosmos okay accounts hang
out tell me about some science shit yeah
you know what I want I asked Neil
deGrasse Tyson what what the fuck is
going on in the middle of Jupiter they
say it's a gas giant yeah we seen
asteroids hit they see there's got to be
something in the center of the fucking
Jupiter what science have to say about
that
that's what I want yeah like you on the
TV show no no Neil we're trapped in this
elevator
let's talk science
that's what you want all right that's
fair that's fair mr. deGrasse Tyson is
there any vain hope of getting faster
than light travels or any loophole or
even close to approaching there you go
rich demands answers yes the movies have
Betty right well that's like like I said
The Hobbit movies aren't awful pieces of
shit they're just bloated like they took
the Hobbit is a relatively small book
and they blew it out to three movies
yeah so it's just a bloated experience I
feel like I know hovering around
somewhere is like the cut that's closer
to the book they took all three movies
cut out all the garbage and made
something that's closer to the books so
the book rich doesn't like airplanes but
wants faster than light travel look I
don't want to get on an airplane but I
could appreciate the benefit to society
of having airplanes also if rich did
want to travel to say California he
would get on an airplane and not a car I
would lobby for the color
really I hate airplanes can I get it
like an Amtrak that's gonna take days
you could get to LA in hours but you
would rather have days
I hate airplanes Wow
that's shocking rich that's just one of
those like it's that it's so beneficial
to everyone including yourself
I think Amtrak an Amtrak would probably
take longer than driving actually yeah
so for me 48 hours with somebody it's
gonna be like a Neil deGrasse Tyson or
uh or a Bill Nighy sure before any actor
Bill Nighy counts he's an act yeah I'm
fine
he counts
he's the Science Guy he counts idea what
I hate her cut hair I hate it I don't
hate it
look at them I hate it it looks really
nice
no I don't like it it looks really nice
and pleasant modern attractive haircut
I'm gonna walk around without hair I
would say that's some nice hair it's not
as fun or is interesting for the
fictional character Bayonetta as the
Beehive was her beehive added to the
personality whether her dangly seventies
outfit yeah or bell yeah yeah yeah I
just don't yeah I don't like this
haircut as much it's not as fun a
haircut or an outfit yeah agreed
I'm with you I'm sure it's I'm sure it's
an unlockable costume in this oh I'm
gonna say I am I did not look this
information up but I am 98% sure you
know Bill Nye just uh he just got a his
Netflix show just came out yeah yeah
he's got a Netflix show : yeah I got a
neck fo sho how's it going I don't spill
my no don't my Netflix show I haven't
seen it yet
but cuz I haven't been able to watch
anything but I know his Netflix show
just came out pretty excited pretty
excited oh and you know what Jack
trigger choices just said Bill Nyes
Netflix show is pure garbage well I
don't I haven't seen it what why is
should Netflix show pure garbage what is
his Netflix show I'm sure it's a science
II Joe wyden it's a science show because
he's the Science Guy
let's see here where did we know he is
not a scientist but he is a science
advocate and he does know a lot about
science even though he's an engineer
he's an engineer but he knows a lot
about science well as an engineer you'd
probably have to and does it isn't he
also like like a higher up at like the
skeptic Association or something I don't
I don't know that he has a rank no
there's no he does have a route spoken
yeah I want to say he does have a rank
in like the National skeptic Society or
so probably a lot of skeptic societies
sure Engineers counted scientists
absolutely but more importantly he's
just he's the science guy does science
stuff James Randi might be interesting
to talk to
you can be and then you can be a science
enthusiast without being a scientist
nice I'm jealous of these men they have
no concept of the shit storm raging in
the outside world over build over Bill
Nye
what did what's good obvious he's he's
hard-nosed about a climate change denial
as I hear you're an idiot you don't pay
attention to the science he's group
agree it's similar against like
creationism yep no I'm fine with this
yeah but he backs up all of his stances
with facts it was like hey like here's
all of the research that these people
have done and that's why I know that's
why I can conclude similarly these
people know here's here's here's all of
our what our rate shirt says is how much
evidence we have hers there's how much
backup you have in your position they
don't deserve equal time is the kind of
thing that Bill Nye would say fine with
that he's not nice to assholes and
assholes don't like it pretty much right
rich it's got nothing to do it well but
asking you for the last 15 minutes what
does it have to do with what did Bill
Nye do wrong what is the shitstorm to
have something to do with sjw's rant is
Joe yep by the way it does ah I don't
give a shit I'm seeing what people are
saying right now and that's that's what
it is we don't give a shit
Bill Nye is great I'm seeing what what
people's problem with Bill Nye I am I am
so sick of hearing about that crap yeah
oh god bill my apparently rich yeah he
did something terrible
what'd he do he talked about gender okay
yeah and people are pissed what do you
say about gender that it's a spectrum
okay is there some kind of scientific
study that backs this up yes okay what's
the problem there's less the fucking
problem people now call him an sjw and
don't worry that's the that's the
problem
okay anything else
I'm sure I'm sure there's other stuff
yeah
all right well that's it that's good I'm
moving on here
there's a famous male actor we did that
The Hobbit trilogy
hey rich yeah you know who's the best
you know who we love who we love
Stephanie wouldn't you agree
who's Stephanie Stephanie we love her
wouldn't you agree
no because I don't know who you're
talking about Stephanie I'm talking
about Stephanie she's great
I need context here Jack what is going
on just saying
that's it I'm just saying Stephanie Jack
can you please elaborate on why you
think Return of the King gets batch of
there's just a lot there's a lot in
Return of the King it's one of my
favorite and three just because fury
road level just because of fury road
level of desert fighting awesomeness and
emotional highs it is no but I mean it's
there's a lot and you know once you get
to the third movie we start kind of
reintroducing aragorn's political side
of it and like we meet the these you
know other kings and we're in these
other castles and you got the giant
battles with the elephants and it's so
like to me I don't mean batshit as a
negative it just it's a lot there's a
lot to deal with and I just honestly
don't care I'm invested in Lord of the
Rings because of Frodo's Journey to the
ring item I never really cared about
Eragon yeah many gifts to the thing and
he doesn't do anything it's it's an
accident that saves the day it's more
than that it's good one more than that
the ring has powers and the only fun so
you have the oily fans uh so like you
know I didn't necessarily care about
arrogant aragorn's
political backstory but I'm not saying
it's a bad move it's it's great it's a
good movie I just if I had to rank the
three and that's how I would do it I
would do it in order
now rich kind of answered your question
about his biggest caviar dream if he
were to become a famous voice actor and
his answer to that was he would he would
spend less time here that's his biggest
Fabio dream I believe that's what you
said right I want a house let me have
yard I want to be a homeowner that's
a--that's a fine dream rich it's a fine
dream we're going to start we're going
to start a renting rich out for
voiceover work so contact us here don't
don't use contact at red letter media
they'll never get you a prereq at red
letter media I wanna I want to not have
to worry about the day that people lose
interest in red letter media there's no
money here anymore okay
and I don't have to worry about not
having a roof over my head I just want
to net that my caviar dream and be our
dream is as simple as having a nest egg
that's that's and that's really it
that's a good caviar dream rich that's a
very practical caviar dream so get get
rich in your cartoon prereq at red
letter media it's happening happening
Michael Cote CA says hey Jack and rich
anymore plans for old Sierra LucasArts
game or even Phoenix right soon you fuck
you presume we'd plan this up like in
advance yeah we'll probably do them
again yeah Julie no I still want to do
more space quests definitely yes later
the first one and well I mean but before
that we have to finish at least this
case of Phoenix right so yes we will do
more
her hair beasts have grown more
elaborate that's true Rich's entire goal
in life is to be left the fuck alone and
you can more easily be left alone if you
own your own home it is rich could you
talk about the voice work you did for
too loud uh I don't I don't know that I
can I don't know that I have much to say
anyways was it we I know it was weird we
smallish role it's a very small role and
like I was recording it so I was like
monitoring your levels and helping
direct you yeah I was helping coach you
and I know you were a little
uncomfortable with it I think everything
when it comes to and when it comes to
acting you know even even voice acting I
think everything I do is terrible okay I
just do everything I've ever done in red
letter media where I was acting I think
it's terrible it was it was a strange
process that the person who's making the
cartoon wasn't able to like listen in
live on the recording session because
you know there's a California right over
there
and so like we kind of found a suitable
voice for what we thought the character
would be together and I was kind of
helping you coach and we went over with
him a little bit your voice and he
seemed to be all cool with it so it was
a weird process just because you're not
talking with the person with the vision
you know
shit what was that yes Clem I can hear
you I can see you stop saying we what do
you mean stop saying we
I what I was like what Oh
during your voice acting section he was
just there I was there so I say we he's
behind the camera or the microphone the
microphone I was behind the microphone
in this case is that Phil Lamarr
was I wasn't really listening
hmm all right the Zaius says news that
Adam warlock will make his debut in
guardians of the galaxy three makes my
makes me feel my theory that vision will
actually become warlock an infinity war
won't come to pass just a random thought
I don't know who yeah I didn't who's
Adam warlock he's a character I don't
have time to explain detail he battles
his rival or you know antagonist okay
please I don't I don't really want to
call him the protagonist of the Infinity
Gauntlet story but he was firmly in
opposition of Thanos trying to try to
get him to not have the Infinity
Gauntlet okay okay he's triggered
they've traditionally been enemies sure
and as he is he on the same power level
of Thanos ish or is he like wow you know
Costanza Thanos starts reading those
reaching those like God level powers is
hard my friend it's not just about fan o
stenoses his main ability isn't brute
force its strategic okay and Adam
warlock opposes him in in that matter
with strategic oh yeah
what strategic okay it's like Jess it's
like chess jack I didn't I didn't I
didn't think they were gonna bring Adam
warlock into it all in at all I thought
the vision was just going to take his
place
oh sure some of the chances they thought
the vision was going to become Adam
warlock
I just flat out thought they're just
gonna use the vision to do the things
that Adam warlock would normally do okay
cuz Adam warlocks got the the soul gem
on his forehead usually traditionally oh
and in age of Ultron they they gave out
of my vision the mind gem sure so I
thought okay they're gonna they're gonna
have vision be the Adam warlock but I
guess not have we seen the soul gem yet
which ones have we seen we've seen space
we've seen power every scene space we've
seen ya space was uh that was the The
Avengers the tesseract right dev a space
that space that open the portal to yes
to the other yeah power space-time and
what was it in the Thor the dark world
ooh maybe that was soul I don't know
what was that and I'm not sure
so I'm saying all but soul all right so
we have not seen so we're gonna get out
of warlock but the soul gem okay hmm
Nosa knows these movies have no soul Oh
someone some people are saying that it's
going to be in Ragnarok so that would
make yes yes if that's where we meet
this warlock character you guys are just
saying words now we are just saying
words now things like tesseract Ragnarok
our fans know what this shit is I know
but if you string enough of them
together yes it does sound like
gibberish no one remembers anything from
for Thor to that is very true that is
very very true as there ever been a good
comic book movie that isn't Marvel or DC
Rock tear the rocket familiar with a
right angle that's a fine a comic book
movie
what was the Tom Hanks movie Road to
Perdition okay that's a fine movie now
we're talking about just based on a
comic book or like superhero that's the
question right spawn was not good chat
spawn was not good Sin City Sin City
there you go yeah
so yes there has dread yeah yeah
dreads a fine movie some of the Turtles
you know turtles are giffy the
watchman's not good sorry know if you're
knowing B I don't like it
you Scott Pilgrim vs. the world that's a
fine movie you ever see that Scott
Pilgrim vs. the world it's a fine oh
wait no no I have not seen that oh okay
that is a fine movie debt and you know
that's even like that's not super hero
that's indie comic stuff so they made a
great movie out of them some
motherfuckers always trying to ice skate
uphill blade blade and blade - yeah good
movies darkman not based off of a comic
though
no but superhero s it's firmly in the
genre of superhero yes that's a
superhero movie but not based off the
comic
okay did we establish that head to be
based off a comic or just I thought that
was a comic book movie cuz it is the
superheroes I thought that was the kind
of a question but I don't know
you know like hell the Hellboy movies
kind of ride this spectrum for me of
like good and not good you know where
they're not great and some of the action
is really awkward and sloppy but the
imagination and Ron Perlman of course
make it work kind of so the hell both of
the Hellboy movies waiver they waiver
back and forth on the good/bad spectrum
chat saying men in black I think
technically that might be Marvel wasn't
that their edge imprint or one of their
one of their I don't know their adult II
kind of brands
I was like before max they had edges I
think I think is that where men and
black came from I mean it's possible I
have no idea I'm possibly entirely wrong
about that
Oh blade is Marvel so that doesn't count
yeah blade is definitely more sorry I'm
sorry you're right so is Howard the dark
you don't like Guillermo del Toro I
can't help you then I can't help you if
you don't like Guillermo del Toro yeah
you know he doesn't always Oh John's kid
then this is the hair right ooh maybe
there's that other one in the blue
that's probably her kid interesting
what was the gamble the horror movie
with the hand eye creature Oh hands
lemon Pan's lab oh where it's like like
Hellboy rides that spectrum Blade - I
just think is great but it's a little
schlocky yeah Pacific Rim I could see
someone not liking it I was okay because
it was schlocky but Pan's Labyrinth is
brilliant so I guess what you know what
if you say you don't like Guillermo del
Toro I'm gonna be okay with that
yeah but give Pan's Labyrinth to try if
you have not seen it Pan's Labyrinth is
a is serious stuff
no I've never seen his crowing the
Kronos
mine your loom insane didn't we go
through this already
oh now oh now you fight
Neuer intro for the background the wave
my way but I see your chat hold on
reality blue says last time I'll try to
get your attention so I'm not spamming I
have an idea for the sidebar use the
purple grid from your newer intro for
the background ooh
that's not a bad idea I thought I was
dead
that's Spacey Mountain grid oh you're
very close to being dead oh I will I'm
not gonna win yeah I stopped doing
anything this I thought I was actually
dead dead I got you yeah Pan's Labyrinth
is something on a whole nother level
like that's that's that's it's guillermo
del toro telling a small personal story
with a lot of budgetary restraints where
he just makes his creepy effects lasts
and labyrinth is wonderful
her creatures are battling each other in
the background Jack what that's awesome
that's great rich that's great
oh now reality blue I appreciate this
suggestion thank you thank you
exactly Jack Pan's Labyrinth is on
another level it is it's Pan's Labyrinth
is amazing storytelling it's and it's
that it's that classic like visual
storytelling it's very fairy tale a
square
you know this these horrors that the
little girl sees are representations of
her feelings odds great it's great
monsters as metaphor filmmaking yes both
rich and I did finish Bayonetta one yeah
you'll hear all about it soon hopefully
this weekend hopefully this weekend the
Incredibles The Incredibles is a great
superhero movie
- been out of Dodge oh that's right he
did mimic - yeah mimics not a very good
movie I mean I could see Pan's Labyrinth
I could see the argument for Pan's
Labyrinth being overrated as you hear me
gushing about it but like I said
monsters as metaphor that's what it's
all about so it's visual ton of visual
storytelling and then like his other
good movies are arguably schlock like
Pacific Rim is silly Blade 2 is silly
but they're awesome if you like each
lock Oh
all right good that's all I got to do
rich get to the next level
ah wow so pretty good actually
okay I was not in jeopardy whoo now keys
answer what's what's the illicit
Maleficent yes that's very Maleficent
well oh do you get to control the giant
monster oh no this is badass fight thing
you got a kaiju battle in the background
rich I know right that's great
Pacific Rim was just a passion project
because he likes dumb mechs yeah no he
does he does but like I said it's it's
silly and it's action schlock and if
you're into that it's good it's you know
it's good at what it does
but I'm understandable I'm saying I'm
going to be sympathetic you know at
first someone said Guillermo del Toro
they didn't like them and I was I was
ready to be like wow you're wrong and
this is why you're wrong but what I'm
saying is I'm sympathetic to your point
of view because he's made some bad
movies mimic with oh god what was that
actresses name in
I was one with a bug monster I was on
with the bug monsters and there was that
that actress who was in it who for like
a year was in every moving was going to
be like the next super Hollywood starlet
and then disappeared Oh what was her
name not not Sarah Michelle Gellar
someone's gonna tell me
oh that Oh beefcake nice Mira Sorvino
beefcake with the excellent fraud bots
update Mira Sorvino does not do much
anymore was everywhere for a while just
god damn everywhere
close the vini is a different one who is
right on the precipice there all right
this is this is a good boss battle Jam
I'm glad I'm happy that you're happy
rich
hmmm let's see here
Annie Gamora says I like big butts and I
cannot lie you other brothers can't deny
that when a girl walks in with an itty
bitty waist
alright now I'm controlling nice see
that's what you needed that's exactly
stick a move right
stick and move
high n I'm so sorry I said that so when
a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
and a round thing in your face you get
sprung you want to pull up tough that
was an eager more
Rock'em Sock'em kaijus that look like a
fun battle that was very fun stone yeah
I'm so I mean you died rich I won you
might get a brown we're gonna die die
one no but you got no you mean in
general stone and lucky missed side
missions yeah I remember doing the Power
Stone stream Jax that he likes butts
better I think I talk about that every
time this comes up I like I do like big
butts and I cannot deny other other
brothers or I cannot lie but other
brothers can't deny or might be able to
deny but I cannot deny
there should be a cold lump award no
that's what the stone is ah that's what
the stone is yeah Wow
okay rich needs some stretching ah la
face with an Oakland booty that's that's
you know that's a fine
that's a fine choice what Oh rich rich
had something to say about them he's
gonna come back huh it looked like you
had something to say about that okay uh
dis dat seven I'm just gonna have to
disagree you know people and you know
what I'm not saying that that you're
wrong in the things that you enjoy about
a lady but you know the things that you
enjoy about lighting the things that I
enjoyed about it Olay do we have
different things different tastes and
that's fair that's fair uh you know it's
whatever you're into that's all right
whatever you're into I just wish luc
besson wouldn't make any movies where
the hero is flirting with the teenage
guys that luc besson is doing now
I'm not doing the stand-up timer much
anymore mostly because now that it's
getting nicer weather out I ride my bike
here and that that is my exercise I'm
also wearing my biking shorts and so I
don't necessarily want to stand up now
to show you my biking shorts so very
very high cut you're gonna see a little
too much a little too much white meat as
they call it and you don't want to see
that so
so I try not to do it you know what I am
doing my stretching I'm like stretching
my legs right now eggs I know I know
that's gonna be tough because I can't
get eggs cuz I rode my bike here and
it's like I'm not like I have my
backpack but I'm not gonna swing by the
grocery store put eggs in my backpack
and then bike home because that's going
to boom this eggs everywhere it's a
disaster
being self-employed how do you find time
to work out when it snows a lot of
indoor workouts I still I still walk
everyday even when it's snowing out I'd
go for a walk every day that's so
important even if it's just around the
block go for a walk every day get out
and you know you just you do with a
little workout - Ken you know do some
push-ups I haven't been working out much
lately concentrating on cutting at the
moment just cut
but so I'm just not gonna have eggs
tomorrow which is a shame I'll have to
think of a different breakfast million
dollar idea an egg carrier for bicycles
but how would that work that that would
be a complex mechanism it'd be like it
has to be like one of those camera
gimble's that keeps your eggs you know
that keeps your eggs from from shaking
and I don't I don't know how you would
even do that how many miles do I though
I mean if it's really snowing out I'll
just go around the block once but like
on an average day like I go for a walk
every day I just it's that's really
important because I sit at a desk the
rest of the day so tell us more about
your bike I know my bike is great I just
got a new bike before I got my new bike
I actually had a folding bike for
occasions just like this where what if I
Chi I ride my bike to the studio and
then it rained and I need to get a ride
back home so I got a folding bike uh it
like collapses on itself and folds into
something that you could fit into a
trunk but the only problem was the tires
were very small to make sure that it was
compact and that that made pedaling a
little more difficult and that made
every bump you hit you felt so I
actually just got a new bike that is not
closing nice so what's up just talking
about the bike yeah talking about
talking about walking every day rich I
go for a walk every day that's not
important to me Oh even even on days
when it is snowing terribly I will at
least walk around the block
because I just sit all day you know and
I'm on the computer all F&A; do I like my
new bike I do it's got much bigger wheel
so the folding bike had 20-inch wheels
which like I said you hit a bump with a
with a bike that has those tiny wheels
you're gonna feel that fucking bump so
my new bike is 26 inch wheels and is a
lot larger it has more speeds old by
katta7 speeds new one has 21 speeds
and I really enjoy my new bike so which
is good because I like a bike like you
know I live close ish to the studio like
I live close enough where I would feel
bad on a nice day driving you know you
escort low key his name is Loki yes his
name is Loki yeah but you know I got my
I got my light got my on my front light
I got my my rear flash of light got my
sweet-ass helmet a bike shouldn't the
glasses slip off underwater she should
also brought drown yeah I mean a lot of
things happen in this kit she's magic
she is literally a witch she the glasses
can do whatever she tells them to do
it's if you know what I'm gonna equate
it to equated to Indiana Jones hat how
many times she has had a fuckin flown
off never to be seen again
besides the one joke time yeah oh of
course oh no with all the running he
does there's joke like twice right is
that the whip that he reaches back for
and I thought that was the hat and maybe
then tumble doom was the head
wait look better than done it a couple
they didn't also did it in Last Crusade
the release had spent twice oh sure like
a callback and yeah there's been one
reaching under a door forgot if that was
an early part of Raiders or if that was
in like the bug section of Temple of
Doom he reaches back to the head oh yeah
oh no and doesn't he do it in Raiders in
in that opening sequence listen um it
could be the whip he's gone flat for but
and then in Temple it was leaving the
bug room yeah he reaches back for the
hand then Last Crusade it blows up
during that insane tank fight this time
it just happens to blow back by him as
he's getting up after everything is
settled down that's great oh they're
saying in Raiders he reaches back for
the whip okay hmm
the bug section you know the bug room
the room where he has to read you should
know what I'm talking about where I
shouldn't need to explain that where
what's her name has to reach through the
barrel no way Marian was um Willie Scott
Willie Scott has to reach through the
the bug area to pull the handle because
he's about to get impaled on Shrike
let's see here huff hearted says hey
guys Jack as a parent I appreciate your
honesty on an earlier stream about your
picky eater accepting defeat is the key
to good parenting parenting or maybe not
I'm no expert
is it like accepting defeat yeah that's
one way to look at it that's one way to
look at it's just you know choosing your
battles how important is that thing to
you and like that's just not about being
a parent that's like in a relationship
like how important is this fight to me
right and so so yeah it's like you know
sometimes we're making meat some
vegetables sometimes we don't
oh they go I thought that was gonna be a
bullshit invisible wall
what I'm just reading just reading the
tick it's weird the tick I'm reading and
I'm bringing the the tick of the stream
the tick of the chat Temple of Doom is
scary crusade is boring no last Crusades
great that's it that was great what he's
got great he's got great play with his
father him and Sean Connery right on
screen and I think the tank fight is
probably my favorite stunt sequence in
all the films yep
yeah that's a great sequence that that
movie works me just because of the tank
fight he's that about the advices father
game you know use the Aadland in the air
he remembers that he grabs the rock that
that section is amazing no and you know
like the the figuring the figuring out
of the of the temple and all the puzzle
elements you know me like as fun uh and
and you know what when everyone assumed
that that would be the last Indiana
Jones movie it should have been
what a wonderful no I'm sorry I misspoke
because that was definitively the last
Indiana Jones movie oh sorry I misspoke
it was a great way to end the series
they quite literally rode off into the
sunset yeah with the super health potion
that was great yeah the boat chase scene
that the you know going going through
the old libraries the the underground
tombs is classic Indiana Jones the
lady's a Nazi wants the tank fight makes
it work me I think without that oh I
know this is great there's the action
scenes in that aren't as strong as half
the half of Raiders of the Lost Ark man
yeah okay everything in Raiders is just
fantastic
yeah just good old-fashioned fisticuffs
every every action said Pete though
percent piece though is just excited
Basha
yeah I know I'm with you I'm with you
yeah then some of the action bits and
glass Crusades a little more hit or miss
hmm you got the young Indiana Jones
stuff that's cute
it's cute you know oh yeah the boat
scene fines fine okay my chase was good
oh the bike chase was good but the tank
scene was amazing all right I mean
you're right that saves it saves Last
Crusade that and that Sean Connery oh
yeah he was great you agree now what do
I buy what should I buy what do you got
how much money yet I got one well you
don't got that much cash man you buy
these weapons you get some swords let's
get some swords
yeah get some swords great you know what
rich great oh Jesus Christ
well you people in the chat are going
nuts for what Indiana Jones and yeah
well let me know the dude is just saying
they're saying about LaVon wait you can
buy a beehive from him
that's what they were saying but don't
listen to them because they might be
lying so we're going back and checking
you so late it's still I'd buy it out
probably in the right run run in the
void rich run in the FIDE do you need
some sweet techno music playing during
that
the world-famous Rhoda they will mail a
beehive tear once like they will mail a
beehive to your house what are you even
talking about what could I do you fool
probably an accessories Ryan Mallett of
rewards
what is that Oh weird
it's a mallet maybe you can't buy it yet
Oh apparently I'm just misspoke and miss
speaking they don't know nothing about
no beehives okay Pizza train 11 says
okay I guess I care enough about your
answer to tip you for this bun do either
of you frauds have thoughts yay or nay
about the American Gods show personally
I can't wait but I've read the books
Neil Gaiman's American doll I'm not
enough familiar with it I've never read
the books but apparently the show is
fantastic I haven't seen it yet it is on
it's on Starz and I cancelled my Star
subscription but I'm going to get it
back again soon because they have some
other good stuff happened happening in
and I've heard great things about it
supposed to be a really good show I feel
like Harrison Ford actually got excited
for Star Wars but will he feel the same
for Indy I hate to break this team it
was the other way around
Harrison Ford hates Han Solo he's been
wanting him to die since return to the
Jedi yet he always says he would go back
to do another indie movie it's the other
fucking way around I'm sorry
yeah I know you like Star Wars but
Harrison Ford doesn't it's true that's
true
he says it's on multiple occasions and
if they make another Indiana Jones movie
it will be a giant disappointment a lot
like that fake Indiana Jones movie yeah
they shouldn't do another
that would be they've already taken a
giant step backwards in the Indiana
Jones universe another movie will be yet
another step backwards
alright so I need to do something to
this need to do something to it what it
what did your hint say I guess no all
right well hey first on first time I
went up to it the prompt was to say I
needed to do something to make this
activate oh then I walked up to it again
apparently that's what you needed to do
you have time powers because Harrison
Ford doesn't like working with George
Lucas now entirely possible Lucas is on
those Indiana Jones sets man he just
doesn't want to be directed by Lucas
whoo
he looks neat whoo you know what that's
all we need we need some help Rob us up
in here pain ern I think my friends and
I might have had a falling-out
George Lucas is the entire reasons part
forsook he is not involved I think
Spielberg once once a corrective measure
and yes Spielberg was still there man
Spielberg was still there for Indy for
so I don't know maybe Spielberg can't
say noted it told George button
oh if that's true bad news and shoes bad
news and shoes says that Harrison Ford
owns a piece of the rights to be Indiana
Jones character and that's why he likes
making the movie if that is true that
would make a lot of sense
we kicked them in the button
yes feel Berg has a pretty good track
record for films and I get you know is
everybody can everyone can have a couple
misses but there were some mistakes with
Crystal Skull there were some big
mistakes with Crystal Skull not the
least of which or that our main
character was an 80 year old invalid I
can't watch old-ass Harrison Ford and
swing through the jungle man yeah I
can't unless that's the joke is that an
elderly is doing action I can't be okay
with it
as a member of red letter media I am I
am okay with the elderly doing things
for my amusement right right but I don't
feel like he was funny he wasn't doing
yoga he wasn't learning how to use the
internet you know
all right I think we're gonna have to
leave it here rich yeah it's gonna it's
gonna start raining okay in about a half
an hour all right according to my
weather and it's gonna take us half an
hour to get through the frickin subs
well that's why I want us there okay
okay that's why I want to start now and
you just happen to beat a demon I think
that's fair so I I'm enjoying this more
than I like the first one
Oh so we interests there you go Jack so
then I could top track it down they've
smoothed down some of the rougher edges
then maybe maybe yeah interesting
we're just talking about it maybe he's

just the worst of times you guys want

guerrilla interrupted is um they wanted
to remake the the cover for with the
four characters oh yeah yeah if you
remember for them for the DVD for the
DVD cover but they never took production
stills I think part of this isn't how
not to make a movie yeah they never took
production stick skill stills and so I

cover of the DVD the face Photoshop with
it with the face photoshopped in there

threw me under the goddamn bus with that
we love the worst I'm throwing him under
the bus for not being able to fit into
the leather jacket anymore you know you
know what he did what he stole that
jacket we stole it so let Jack basically
from what Jays friend oh yeah yeah

the movie yeah and Mike like that as a
property just never gave back eventually

finally ended up giving it back really
yep

jacket like with their hands and Mike
has kept it always yep did all these
