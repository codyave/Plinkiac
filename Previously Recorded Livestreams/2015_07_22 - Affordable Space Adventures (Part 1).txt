yet maybe hit the start stream I hit
this now we're streaming hello wait wait

with me no it's true
hello everybody welcome welcome to
Wednesday it's Wednesday
hold on I'm tweeting what time Mr seven
it is seven thirteen so we're 13 minutes
late
okay I said we're gonna start around 7
and the Keisei around well it's always
ish yeah I always we always started ish
affordable so I have no idea what the
fuck assist space adventures so you're
gonna have to describe this game thing
for game I and I have never played it
oh I'm - I'm tweeting all right did you
get the tweet ready before you have
starts free magic nope this is all part
of it it's all part of it you guys keep
stacking it yeah we started it oh no

see a video that's weird
hold on I'm gonna check on this alright
check on directory for this is finishes
longest tweet the entire world which is
strange because you only get so many
characters it takes me if there's like
12 characters it takes me a while you
know what it takes me a while
takes me um all the tweet I can't help
it
check tweets like I walk that bad are
you guys see oh oh it's okay okay great
every refresh everybody we should be
streaming everything should be fine so
here is how affordable space affordable
hears that was pitch to me is it's it's
a spaceship game and one person has to
control stuff like the engines and like
be the captain and the other person gets
to control things like the guns and
other stuff and then you have to work
together to like allocate power to
different things while the other person
shoots the gun and stuff okay that's how
it was pitched to me I have not played
it I am excited
I've already sent the tweet Lucky
Strikes
so how about you settle down
and now I'm just making sure that we're
streaming because people seem to Jack
has been staring at his phone since we
started screaming people seem to have
but yeah okay we are streaming and just
watching the stream right now great all
right
greatest video everything's great Wow
there's a video there is video okay
everything's great
all the things are great so let's rich
you would do you want a wrist strap for
your Wiimote or no wrist strap no wrist
wrap no we're fine you know I don't know
I'd be able to use this from the floor
I'm I'm I'm really hoping there you go
you know what rich I'm really hoping a
it's not starting much no I'm starting
the journey you you're just you're you
get that and I get this journey one
start a new journey ease Trier somewhat
inclusive tourist exploration technical
you want to go technical right that mmm
tourist might be like one person focus I
don't I don't know I join up bridge oh
yeah oh yeah oh good I did bring I
brought the thing
here's the thing plug it in alright well
I get to do the engineer and you get to
be the pilot okay
Oh bother says can you guys just fuck
with the sound a bit to make us feel at
home I mean it's fine right now but just
fuck yeah I'm giddy okay now you have to
hit 80 doing every dip okay great now
you've joined somehow I unjoined oh and
we could have a third player as the
Navigator we don't have a third player
I'm just saying we could oh my god okay
my crew is assembled please adjust the
slider to the darkest possible setting
it's fine it's fine it's four great
that's fine that's great
okay turn then you know some sort Oh oh
my god this is not gonna work turn and
I'm sitting that's right you're playing
c'mon remember to communicate with each
other the game will at one point display
post for me versts
so at one specific point enhance the
game experience by showing post from
either stealing through naval online
features no no I'm sorry I don't want my
game enhanced DeeAnn stuffing a bunch of
crap pop up on the screen weird weird
stupid world breaking things that people
say it's the same with blood-borne and
Dark Souls I don't know how people can
deal with those ghosts pop enough basics
yeah this beautiful world on a bunch of
messages around snow my ass adorable
that spaceship is spectacular
yes jack is fully caffeinated I just
finished a very large coffee and I'm
pretty excited about that so I'm very
excited and happy to be here you know
how do how do you get me to watch a
cutscene give it a delightful British
narration story this is delightful a
checkers guide to the galaxy vaguely
very vaguely just because this is a
British accent
for no other reason I a doughnut says
first the audio is fine and now Jack is
watching a cutscene what the fuck is
going on right the pod people have
invaded and they're more confident so
you should be glad I'm Agha vengers I do
like the Dyson commercials we've
configured our vacuum cleaners to never
lose section of rent to my small craft
is a date don't like to fake add yeah
yeah it's a fun way to do checks plural
checks floor all right are we ready to
Jack's floor yeah I have no idea what
I'm doing but I'm ready to do it we're
ready to do it rich we're gonna go on a
Dora believe enter Oh bother I mean the
Dyson guys a little much especially his
like his blade thing if you've ever used
the Dyson blade in a bathroom it saver
places the hand blower the Dyson blade
is just like we've revolutionized how to
draw your hands it's a revolution it
reminds we have an e3 video there it's
all always a revolution
okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
oh and for some reason
all right thing on the screen I don't
know I'm not doing anything do you need
to power an engine oh it's starting it's
starting on my own you know what we
don't have my screen isn't on so you
guys just get to see what's happening on
the main screen those are a lot
happening on your screen there's stuff
happening on my screen how much is
happening you know let's see here the
small craft scanner system is equipped
with a flashlight to illuminate the
world around you
tap the system to enable and disable it
aim with the right stick okay ready
enable okay and then I get to like a
look around and shit okay
all right this is my job okay great
that's great and I could turn it off
oh whoa the small craft fuel engine is
the basic engine the vessel is equipped
with tap fuel engine to start and stop
the engine and steer
oh my god Jack what are you honking the
horn honking horn get out of here wait
how do I steer that you oh that's me ah
how'd it go up and down and shit oh my
god oh oh you know what I can't turn the
light on
oh my god this is deep so I'm running
the lights and rich is steering the ship
oh no we crashed rich what we crashed
look we're I don't know we didn't crash
yeah look oh the container is carrying
us crashed is what I'm saying
Oh with that oh no rich what are we
gonna do we're gonna explore yeah mother
fucker
oh go in there can you go oh where where
where can you go in there
yeah well the things falling out yeah
that's probably sitting on there Oh oh
my god look at my life fix it you're the
fucking engineer Oh small crabs hit by
lightning the small craft was hit by
lightning from an electromagnetic storm
all the systems turned off alright I
just turned the engine back on
and the scanner Becca what is long I
don't know what I want to pick that up
nope it's on a different plane of
existence stop honking horn I want the
shit alright trailer we can't go too
high okay it's powering up okay ready
engines on scanner on stand low Richard
Edlund Evans you have a beautiful
singing voice I did I got jumps whoa can
we can we grab it nice nothing nothing
I'm tell you creepy
we did it that was all hey I feel really
great about this you want rich to honk
the horn mark
okay oh sorry I need to hit continue
yeah about this okay all right
kind of looks like we're inside of a
giant human no I'm just saying
those look like veins blue some people
seem like okay they're ceiling up there
and there's floor down here back here
this one feeling like a wallet hard to
tell what's a wallet out yeah kind of -
okay like what the light bounces up whoa
yeah like - that one
fuck you know this this definitely
reminds me of like uh oh it's the movie
with Martin Short inner space inner
space yeah highly underrated movie love
fucking love inner space oh this needs
like an inner space mod well hey it's a
fucking floor
I wonder what the Navigator would do
they might they have a map to look at I
don't know
well the Navigator gets another Wiimote
so so I have the gamepad and I've is
like a screen like a very FTL like
screen the only thing I can do is turn
on the engine and turn on the scanner at
the moment I'm never gonna might handle
like a flashlight maybe and rich has
rich has a Wiimote and Nunchuk pointing
has done nothing so far but cuz because
I'm on the floor and it's not working
right
maybe pointing I think pointing you get
later when a maybe a gun happens okay is
what I can only assume will there's
gotta be more for you to do Oh tonight
oh no that's still a thing it's still or
bet well well they're obviously dead
nobody know this is a great engine ready
and no I think that fall and the flippin
nah yeah we got an inertial dampeners so
you say oh wait there's some down here
it's too obvious so fuckin box probably
not the way yeah all right
are you honking for your friends
I'll keep your hearty
that's a bumper sticker I just hope
something happens Simon you know this is
just teaching us the ropes
yep see like there's an obstacle so now
we learn that we can push things great
oh wait wait wait what I wanna think
something that is repaired Oh
fuel thruster the fuel thruster systems
lets you configure the speed and force
of the small craft tap the thruster to
change its system power so now we are at
full thruster what holy fuck
hold on hold on going down coming back
then oh shit shit what happened
hello I tried to push the thing and that
way blew up it burned out small craft
overheated the small craft overheated
due to internal overload and got
destroyed then you didn't tell me about
these things Jack why did I'm just a
pilot here I'm going back to - okay I'm
back to - thrust now we didn't need this
for anything apparently not okay
get back to scan in here
I know if we need more thrust okay need
more one more thrust nope okay one more
thrust more now okay okay oh I oh I see
the oh wait go down go down stop stop I
turned off all thrusters we were all we
have a felt we were over it we were
overheating yes oh no I had a little
thing on my screen I saw the pride the
overheat progress bar wait was there
anything else up there
oh well it's not now oh you know what
and uh leftover beep cake your your
switch thing isn't working right now so
I see a fruit pie the magician thank you
for subscribing we very much appreciate
it it's not working it's not working
right now hold on turn it back on see
it's working now
there we go
now it's working sometimes it's all you
got to do is turn it off turn it back on
again whoa easy now
there's only shadows explore check this
like radar
oh yeah that's kind of annoying we've
already been over here so I'm just gonna
look over here we know we're doing yeah
we know what we're looking for uh ice
apparently whoa nothing are you so sure
I mean no
take up a thrust when I'm moving fast
enough sure what I owe its mass
generator science is magic the mass
generator lets you increase the ship's
mass tap mass generator to configure its
system power what how will that help us
make us heavier or lighter oh oh we
probably need to uh sink coming up well
say I can only assume yep yep you're
buoyant ok mass generator 1 mass
generator 2 can you go down now just
affirm
I'm actually stuck here right now mass
generator 3 ok oh my god no I can't
steer I can't steer you can't steer mass
generator to thrust hold on thrust up
one does that say about no no we just
need a good descendent you think we just
need to sink well let me know let me
know it's coming up cuz I gotta keep an
eye on my yeah look at what's coming up
weights up is that a thing on that wall
no it's not ok we can go down what's
what's down there what's up look no
that's just okay okay continue sinking
what something right okay
oh my god I think it's about to get real
rich I think it's about to get real
oh my god ready come on stop now now now
oh how do we get over there now um what
happens thrust all the way
thrust all the way yeah press all the
way nope sound turning thrust down mass
dung mass down to one up up
that's dumb how do we get over there I'm
gonna try turning engines all the way up
and then turning to mass make us lighter
now are you moving at all
I'll get over there I guess so you know
we just kind of got to get to the bottom
ish Oh nope wrong way
tell me when now that's fine what's down
there
nothing up
down oh wait no that's how those don't
kill us I thought those might kill us
I thought those would kill us too okay
well they were young we learned a lesson
or doesn't kill I have one person
control the light in one person control
the ship yeah yeah that's what we're
doing I'm controlling the light and the
power and rich is steering the ship I'm
not doing anything right now yeah well
buoyancy we're just going being buoyant
right now and mass generator oh my god
thrust down Thresh down nice
communication nice communication work
that's the panel oh that's hilarious
apparently we're on the wrong side oh
wow that's fine that's fine thank you
it's all love hate it's all a love-hate
kind of thing I'm glad to clarify that
for you and I'm glad I know your love of
us it's very interesting so far this is
exactly what I was expecting by the way
and so I can only assume now we're gonna
run into some sort of like you know
puzzles in which we yeah I would want
something that requires more teamwork
interesting what the fuck
well yeah there it's gonna chase this is
that they're easy
apparently not they're easing us into it
that you just hit a button that's great
going down going down going down wait
thing thing to them thing to explore it
there's more wreckage a lot of shit has
blown up over here it looks like a Scan
button or something
well the scanner is just a light you
know Oh a message for the pilot oh
that's you scanner flare the small craft
scanner system is equipped with flares
flares can be used for marking and
signaling hold be to load flare and
release to shoot
quite the flashlight okay see you ain't
oh my god
okay would you want to go down oh okay
oh oh I get it that's cute this whole
thing is cute
you know what this whole thing is cute
this is Li I mean it's like a Star Trek
game kind of mazes be a little bit more
complicated I I can only admit I imagine
we'll get there but I don't get there
its easiness in rich be comfortable with
me to be like managing a shield system
like FTL that would be great that would
be great Oh tilt controller you can tilt
the gamepad up to 90 degrees in order to
control the pitch of the small craft
what turn us when we can fit to that
hole okay
doesn't really matter last first area
there we go
a spur not too high nope
not to I now
we've been punished for going too high
too many times Oh
blow that up ah sure nope up in there
I'm really sorry that you guys can't see
what's happening on the gamepad cuz it's
a little adorable it looks like an old
windows 97 operating system concerned
pods that's great okay cuz everything's
up
why am i when we went into the concern
pod it turned everything off what's good
what can we doing there ah that was
broken is what the voice said okay so we
need to find other concern pods
that's weird like having to steer
together yeah can Jack ever understand
something on the first read listen
sometimes sometimes and sometimes it
takes a little bit more
all right
doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo
yep we're a doopy spaceship
oh okay
we can do this I'm assuming that blows
you up now look at me we'll go back up
it bounces off the blue goop yeah blue
goop but not the yeah but we need to hit
them there's a button oh I see I see my
line go back a little bit go back a
little bit boom
there's one button what's over here
hehe oh just assuming I mean
No okay oh wait you can bounce that shit
off with that right oh yeah nice rich
nice rich I need more thruster oh no
you're doing it oh I'm gonna give you
one more thrust
nothing thrust by one whoa oh crap oh no
no that'll work then we get over here
and bounce it off the others okay
returning back to two thrust that's a
comfortable thrust yeah kick it up kick
it up to three three thrust whoa whoa
whoa oh my god that's what happens when
you kick it up to three throw it's fine
jack it's fine hey we fucking did it yay
that was some excellent teamwork rich
yeah we did a thing oh yes I have heard
of space team have you heard of the
mobile game space team it's like it's
like an iPad game where everyone has a
Star Trek controller layout yeah and
like and then I you and I would have two
different controls yeah and and I would
have to mine would say like turn gravity
from 9 to 10 and you would have a little
gravity control you'd have to turn it
and then your screen would give me a
command and then we would just have to
shout back and forth at each other as
fast as we could oh that seems old fast
yeah but it's cute blue oh my god it's a
cute little gag it's a cute little party
game ganc Oh a message for the pilot
oh my the small craft scanner system is
equipped with a sensor this can be used
to detect the sensor range of unknown
artifacts hold Z to activate sensor
okay
Oh
okay so I'm guessing that some sort of
turret and we cannot
oh wait well I'm gonna I'm gonna throw
slowly down a little bit so I can
navigate nice oh thank you huh whoa that
way
yeah oh holy shit something let's blow
up they either blow up or shoot you or
yeah they're either evil Oh
but apparently you that space team you
can have up to like six players okay and
then you all have to shout and look at
your things and it it seems like it
could be fun I I agree that it would
probably get old very fast and it would
it would be a really great drinking game
until everyone got too drunk and mad at
each other oh it was moss all right mass
mass up your mass is grass output meters
the meters let you monitor the sound and
heat and electrical outputs of what the
ship oh my god okay well we got that
going for us then go up let's go up
I'm driving down here I'm the engineer
rich I can't I can't see anything
Oh rich there's a button all right else
we got a second yeah I got a flair
already Oh friend Hey oh wait not yet oh
that's got it oh my god there you go
nice
nice work nice work rich yeah I forgot
I'm the one who actually fires the flare
oh the small craft fuel engine is
equipped with a stabilizer system that
lets you fly smoothly and precise okay
imagine we're gonna need that shit this
day I turned the stabilizer to two
oh no sound heat electricity stabilizer
2/3 stabilizer to 5 max
although then I need to turn throw you
know turn thrust down stabilizer can't
go to max or else I go to reactor stress
okay okay we got it
you got this yeah yeah reactor sure I'm
at four and reactor stress is still
climbing but slowly oh my god aim it at
the button huh
aim at the button I'm aiming nice okay I
need to turn down the stabilizer or else
our stress is getting too much thank you
for second hangar hangar I just give me
a second here reactor stress and
reducing oh my god rich
I already react to stress back up oh my
god did you hit it we hit it is the
depth I got cocky Jack I got cocky and
my skills that scared me cuz my screen
went black and so just as if I was an
engineer of a spaceship I wouldn't know
when death is coming I would just blow
up okay engines umm stabilizer 2/4 will
oh my god I did did I say I was ready
thrust to one I didn't realize the
default setting was 8 billion all right
turned off what's up there
I never remember my god
because of this this is how my screen
looks by the way oh this is where it's
gonna get interesting yeah yeah this is
exactly what my screen looks like
so heat disturbs the artifacts cost
there's money even though we shouldn't
care about that much cuz we just want to
go home we're a crèche
thank rich I eat doughnuts wants you to
honk your horn next time you're
underwater just to hear what it sounds
like I think I did once I might not have
worked okay we could try again okay
Colonel rich mustard this game is really
cute and I agree that J does need to
play this I J would not get this day
wouldn't ya I don't know if David
Guetta's I I had a couple options I
wasn't sure if I was gonna be here
tonight um if he was gonna be here I was
gonna choose something a little simpler
so we could talk over it cuz usually
when Jays here we end up chatting more
than playing but I'm almost glad he's
not here cuz I really wanted to play
this turn the pressure off a bit
thruster up to two stabilizer is to say
sterilizer where me the stabilizer
stabilizer off
everything is a five by the way five and
I guess six cuz you know what you know
it's off but when it's on its it's a one
to five system the ship makes so much
pollution er well oh okay let's see Pete
actually I'd since I turned our
stabilizer off both our heat and
electricity are good okay so that that
detects heat and electricity well what
happened our heat pumped up a little bit
as you were flying
so it's fine did that dock hose any
points I don't know I can't see anything
boycott okay okay hold on I need to turn
our stabilizers on stabilizer to - how
does that work oh oh wait we need to
scan good call good call
hold on I need to turn on our thrusters
down yeah your stabilizer off and our
stabilizer okay
just scanning proceed scanning does not
produce heat escaping this kind of sound
I think you already turn to green all
right we should be good to pass through
these thruster produces heat stabilizer
produces electricity and other stuff
produces sound and those are the three
variables oh I gotta tell this up this
up squeeze through we've got it we got
it
oh that's all my god the smaller fuck
you want the small craft electric engine
is the convenient and fun engine
preferred by many space travelers it
comes with a range of subsystems to
cater to all your exploration needs tap
electric engine to start or stop the
engine although that's probably when we
need to be really quiet oh that's for
you huh
instead a message for the pilot though
oh I guess yeah why is the message for
me I don't know where did Sagan oh yeah
so now there's a fuel engine and
electric engine okay so I can pump so
you can switch between the fuel on the
electric end yeah and which does which
Electric is quiet I can only assume that
the electric is quiet but it might like
it obviously makes more electricity so I
can only assume that this next thing we
have to scan whoa
possibly know that uses a lot of heat
okay so now I'm gonna turn off the fuel
engine Neelu crash turn on the electric
engine oh wait wait wait wait what do
you what we said turn on II thought it
was good to go I said I was turning on
the electric engine I didn't say just go
fuckin forward because the electric
engine as it turns out uses a lot of
electricity so I need to turn that down
don't okay we are now in optimal range
to use the electric you sir I'm sure
everything will be fine now you just
need to settle down
alright we have no heat and very little
electricity because I turned the power
down the thrust power very far down yeah
okay great now I'm gonna turn the thrust
up Wow yeah well you turn the thrust up
okay oh hold on
whoa we gotta turn the electricity way
down now scan the other thing it's - oh
you know what I think I need to go back
to a few London
and we're gonna turn the stabilizers off
hold on okay we are now using no
electricity and so I go back to the
scanner yep yep okay we're good to go
through these two at least and we're
good to go through that one it's fine
it's fine we have to talk rich we're a
team here I'm talking just fine
we're we're team tiny spaceship we're
gonna die in this this lonely rock
that's probably true but there's a
chance we can make it out and go where
Jack back home in this tiny spaceship
maybe I don't think this thing to do
warp speed jack probably not
we're screwed oh my god why we need a
navigator Oh log and help available vote
the log is a record of what happened to
your ship during the adventure tap the
system's mounted
now I guess I'm just going up general
sure that's nothing okay down thing I'm
a scanner nothing
we're approaching we're approaching
landing no no okay there's no oh there's
the things stand it no we need to turn
our heat down to get through that I
should be good to go
Yeah right we're good to go and we're
good to go as long as we move slow on
it's like a turn on the electric engine
yeah did that because looking brother
move okay yeah can you land I get let me
get over here oh well I can probably
land on this okay I just I just switched
over and I'm gonna turn our thrust up
okay now you can move a little faster
good you're good
those are all heat-based Lilou yep
that is a highness that's a he base
that's fine nope well don't honk your
horn that was a that was a song based on
him do you fuck you fuck your gonna cost
us credits not here I mean obviously
something that's 100 maths mess mess
okay hold on turning off electric engine
turning on fuel engine turning on math
generator flipping around flipping
around crank it all the way up it's all
the way up that's not gonna work it's
not work
all right maybe that's what it's got to
do maybe that has to work maybe all
right but right those are a thing down
there we can shoot maybe
scan again nope Oh
if I turn our antigrav all the way up
well fuck no turn orientate grab all the
way down yeah baby Wow Oh was this a
physics thing go up and down up and down
this can't be right
I'm looking for another way I turned the
mass generator up again that didn't seem
to do anything no
what's this it's not everything down
there
or maybe
interesting oh my god anything up here
maybe there's a dead one oh you turned
on the flare give me my flashlight back
maybe we just missed something up here
thought there was like a car loss at
kravaal there's a curve balls over here
it gets us in the garage yeah we're in
the car buzz the first time go it says
girl Phoenix says go all the way up then
turn mash generator on okay so a head
right above the air spout thing and I'll
just crank up the mass generator and
hopefully we'll sink like a stone don't
that's what you were doing
no no that was the the antigravity of
the electric engine Oh already
turn the end turn the engine off and let
us go up okay
wait actually turn the mess off let me
get right over it okay all right now do
antigrav
oh wait you know what I did I turn to
the thrust all the way off our mass is
all the way up now no stabilizer on does
that do anything no I don't know
ha what we do here is
any graph yeah now can you turn the
engines all engines like kill the
engines completely and do the mass
increases a fuel engine needs to be on
for the mass generator can you turn it
down like thrust on that down all the
way and then the mass generator up all
the way yep already yeah oh oh is but
then I need to like turn it on yeah oh
okay hold on go back up back up
okay ready yeah as soon as we fall that
hole I'm holding right no
and this okay
ah okay ready yes oh yeah let's get you
over a little bit I just did you did oh
okay ready okay yeah
alright alright yeah nice cut everything
cut everything cutting everything whoo
oh great
the heads down display by the way that's
what this is called yeah that's cute
because my good night because my head is
down let me hold the controller off you
know I'm gonna have to remember that you
can't see the screen so well that's the
thing yeah yeah that's you that's why I
need I need vocal cues from you because
I can't see the screen at all because I
have to at this first okay my little
props that's the whole point of the game
right just to get people talking but
that we did it Oh objects can't Oh knots
get it off okay that uses heat and
electricity so if I turn my thrusters no
that's not enough so I'm gonna move to
electric engine
Oh blue for a second I hold on it turns
blue when it's good to go huh
not yet all right now we should be good
can you move it all no okay
no not yet hmm okay I think we have to
use regular engine Wow no no I'm just
drifting ah your dravidan sucked that
way yeah oh my god
just turn anything often without
wrapping suck that way yeah
turn the engine on off off off off
oh no never fucked
what's on right now the antigravity
the only thing that's on is the
antigravity does that do anything no all
right let me try let me try turning it
Electric thrust to one okay that might
work but you can't get moving that way
because the antigravity is all up and if
I turn the antigravity on it'll you know
boost us to a little bit okay is there
anything else that if it turned off of
them the only and and if I turn the
engine on it all oh wait what if I if I
turn the engine on at all it produces
too much heat if i turn any thrust on
does that do anything I know about that
No scan it again
so it's gotta be electric engine let
certain things out let's see if there's
another way oh wait here we go
move nope nope too much okay wait now
try moving nope that's still too much
so that's anti grab on one and thrust on
one on the electric engine and that gets
us too far into the electric field if I
turn on the engine and turn our thrust
even to one we get too much heat we're
gonna try to like jump into it yeah okay
tell me when to cut it give me some more
something cuz I won't stop I'm almost
stuck here okay you got to thrust can
you turn it off like instantly maybe
give me give me can you can you like
give me a ton of thrust and then just
cut it all right okay let's try that
again
how's this thrust give me just full
thrust and I think which is where we
were you gotta cut it quick though I
think all right you ready to cut ready
cut it all right it was a great job
we're cutting it I didn't get it instead
of cutting it I actually turned it up to
max you know what my bad my bad
everybody bad yeah Jack we're time I
don't think you can apologize we're dead
oh well you know hey you ready cut wait
let's scan it for it okay it's all ready
all right hold on hold on hold on hold
on stabilize there all the way off all
right I'm ready
and cut it apparently there's a
cool-down phase okay
so cut earlier got it earlier ah okay
alright cut it
oh there's a big cooldown phase with the
heat okay cuz it's the hot engine so
maybe I gotta use the electric engine
yes okay no wait wait it's only to hold
it I did I wanted to test the cooldown
Oh electricity and by the way the
cooldown rate for the electricity much
faster this is it and cut it hey can you
cut that real quick mister I mean as
fast as I did it there alright cut it
cut it I'm okay oh oh I do I need to
turn it back on
we got eaten by a plant oh my god all
right okay okay
Oh fuckin K this is it rich
I am ready I am ready okay I am ready
then if you already cut it
oh no what
we're in the bad space oh well okay
and cut
I have to think I have to yeah remember
yeah okay oh shit oh shit that was me
that was me my bad my bad I was so happy
we made it out of the one trap oh my god
Phoenix you're right we just got eaten
by spikes this game has taken spikes to
a new and interesting place oh wait are
we dead uh oh shit okay scan you need to
do that I I am there's no flashlight oh
oh oh sorry the scanners we're not
okay these are electricity based all
that weight was it I am I'm bobbing
around that's what this thing does
okay so I think let's try moving our
thrusts and our anti-gravity I need to
turn our fuel engines back up wait
I don't know these are also heat based
what can you just turn on antigrav
just anti-graft will slide up without
steering you think yes I think I'm
almost 100% sure
all right we're through what kind of
regular engine motion okay
thrust what's down there alone it turn
your thrust down a little bit yeah oh
here we go
the decelerator slows down the small
craft to stop in midair as long as you
are not applying thrust
oh okay so like a quick stop don't go on
the electric engine which I can only
assume we'll need at some point but oh
oh the spikes are gonna eat us look at
that so basically if you let go we just
stop fucking thing again all right give
me emotional okay
I'm liking this it's getting better
oh shit mouth shit all right give me
juice give me juice
I'll give you a little more thrust oh
shit
too much too much too fast okay okay
okay okay Iola go down one thrust
should I turn the anti-graft to two
instead of three you're kind of three
it's kind of like stable I guess
are you moving up too much or is fine
yeah we're good we're good
gonna make it through break break yeah
oh shit that just that doesn't stop us
in midair oh oh no no to break you just
like oh no I just like all the things
that is that I'm now
yes that is okay okay decelerate or is
on the decelerate is on for I say yeah
for precision flying mmm gotta move
gotta move oh shit yeah they just
down here
so we don't tilt okay hold on we need to
find a place to toes - stop stop stop
tell me what we're good to go
reactor stress almost reached critical
mass yeah yeah okay ready
thrust is going up to - no downer up jab
horse the piece hold on I'm gonna move
thrust up two three okay okay here we go
oh shit and throw it scan it scan the
thing I'm scanning
okay back that goes for sound and it
looks like cool down our decelerator
produces some sound turn it off we can
do without the children we'll be fine
we'll be fine turn it down to three all
right so you can start moving now see
with oh wait we will what is making that
noise
god dammit rich decelerator at two and
now try moving we're just at the
threshold
it shouldn't hear us but you guys move
shit damn it Did you touch it
i I moved too fast okay alright
cuz the vines reached out for me so
alright so I'm gonna move too fast we
should be able to get past it should I
move your thrust down more
or fire
ah okay I guess I'm assuming this is
gonna be the same thing that is the same
thing so as long as you move slowly it
should be fine
nice and is expert piloting okay again
that there's a new thing okay that is an
electricity and heat thing scan thing
under it
I think they group yeah their
electricity I'm good to go no no we are
not good to go we need to reduce our
electric intake so I think if I just
turned the decelerator down
significantly or off about fuel or we
could go to field well it's also a heat
thing okay what's over here I'm sorry
that's not the way we're supposed to go
nope okay and you scan to the rocks no I
cannot scan through the rocks oh you
know what I bet we could do it but we
can just drop oh wait go all the way
down again go down in this one okay are
there man-eating plants at the bottom
because I bet we could just drop um yes
okay can you leave the decelerator on
just the decelerator yeah and oh I can't
fall that way that way I'm thinking if I
just turn the electric engine off all
right I'll give it a cue okay ready yeah
off huh good good nice nice yeah we did
that terribly died like eight times we
hit all of those ancient artifacts on
our way down too but they didn't detect
us yes affordable space adventure is on
the Wii U and actually it's one of the
only games that actually uses the
gamepad if it's full potential hmm I
think this is a Wii U exclusive I
believe and so I have the gamepad and
I'm like touching the screen while what
rich has a Wiimote and Nunchuk to
control other stuff with nope with no
annoying pointing at the screen I might
add
something's up oh my god oh my god okay
moving oh oh I can move in this Oh with
the electric engine Shh oh it's just
kind of quiet wait wait how about a
water now I want to hear it outside
water ah that's nice that's a nice
little touch
why is this water special oh we use the
different type of engine yeah cuz now
we're in the electric engine so electric
engine swims apparently but no mass
generator
if we ever need to like fall fast I
guess bet that'll end up being a puzzle
oh my god what the crates this looks
fantastic I love I love the look of this
Oh
all right okay oh shit
Jack do something cut everything cut
everything it senses electricity and
only electricity turns Beckham back on
you're good to move quick right thing
closes I can't move I can't move
okay now I can't move I'm stuck huh I'm
stuck how about now or just thinking oh
oh right okay now okay cool
that thing is an electric is here right
so we are we're on Becca an electric
engine so we probably need to need to
fall through this thing now okay hold on
yeah
already yeah you're ready to turn things
back oh I'm ready to get in motion at a
moment's notice
absolutely but now
I need to tilt through here okay tilting
up straight okay okay good good
so tilt there's a button
oh that probably opened something back
over by it yeah okay
everything's so adorable they're super
rich uh-huh I'm so happy playing this
I'm so happy playing with United
spaceship game this makes me happy
Lisa play this right she might okay oh
now this is gonna be interesting
oh shit float oh ma okay ready yeah
loading up we're stocking loading up
mark
nothing to see here I'm afraid and we're
free
okay what did that open up up here
probably oh yeah that's right
earth
did we do we fall here uh no I don't
think so I think a gate opened up okay
it's dum-dum near the top of this thing
or the bottom of that thing
we hey we did it yay rich Jack on a tiny
spaceship adventure red jack
making it through alien worlds yeah
they'll solve problem using friendship
and teamwork pyrite is alright by me
anyway
a lot of TV on I must move my not me
real gold you see wait no one what what
did something blow up I got a weird
error message okay my ears yeah sorry
subscribers oh sure let's take a little
subsea bruh bruh yeah
cuz we made it through that harrowing
cave that was that was really fun okay
let's see here we have smite time just
needs an end there sports and I'm yeah
never be perfect it's my time makan
macaws neck Mick cosmic rooster J mr.
Forman le devoir oh five Davide just
done oh it's Dave ah it's Dave aaaa
0:05 Frank Brian Butterfield Dave I do
thank you all for subscribing
we very much appreciate it it's truly
really do yep yeah I wish you had a
player camera just to see what's on my
screen um but we don't I'm sorry to
subscribe is just fine with me
did it it gives us much-needed buddy we
buy games and play them cash is better
to the Florida sweater
I won't freeze to death this winter I'm
doing a hambone solo ok all right
right great here we go here we go we're
moving on we are we are making it oh so
red red this is straight up oh nice and
across oh wait actually hold on for a
second oh my god hold on for a second
spike weeds I forgot to insert a
bookmark ok I'm right Oh spike weeds
don't care oh there's a thing up here
there's a thing over here what this is
well go green first we need a navigator
oh whoa
I think it's dead I think it's being
punished oh I can't get through the
shame oh wow
what it's kept us from going through
then it's up keep you guys for going
through okay
no matter what the puzzle was maybe our
engines will just said perfectly I
happenstance for whatever that was sure
I don't know okay great bye rich and
Jack musical only 1999 at the rlm start
coming soon are we good to get through
that
no no we're not okay let's see here it
takes up heat and electricity and
there's a okay on that other one too huh
scandal my guess is yeah the same thing
all right okay all right so anti gret oh
I think I can go here Oh No cuz that
just makes you sink right yeah there can
you fly yeah oh no we're still in the
danger zone there can you fly like now
can I are still in danger zone I might
fall
what does that look like if you fly
around nope
no that's too much this has got to be
another electric engine thing or another
way around or another way around hmm cuz
yeah we can't we can't rock it through
that or else we'll hit that yep yeah
well let's I'll give you some more
thrust let's look around
alright I go too much tourists
let's see what's back down here maybe
this had some clues there's a clue
yep
which I don't I don't which I don't
think that some rich I don't think
that's gonna work I don't know I don't
think that's gonna work all right all
right we're going back
oh that thing's like magnetized
interesting scan that red light rose
that red light everything no I can't get
this thing to follow us let do anything
okay oh how did that stick to us what
does it say when you see what the scan
information er nothing
it gives me an electricity flow am i
doing that are you doing that it gives
me a electricity flashing but you know
no warnings really
you know there's there's there's
definitely a magnetized thing happening
you know all right all right head back
up maybe I just need to relook at some
of the controls as to what does what
what's giving us our weird heat
electricity thing
okay heat electricity oh you know what
what you know it uses electricity the
scanner really yes
so if I turn the scanner off the thrusts
down to one and the anti-graft to two
and the deceleration all the way off
does that yeah how's that can you move I
can't go up I will probably crash into
the laser okay hold on let me see if I
can stay up no I can't okay
that's too much right now can you move
I'm sitting fuel won't work
mm-hmm fuel I don't think I'll work cuz
I think that gives us too much heat okay
yeah no we'll crash oh the laser okay so
right now the only thing pumping
electricity is thrust an anti-gravity
anti graph is that too now and you're
barely making it up you know I turn the
thrust all the way off in just the Anti
Doping nope
so like the in order to be under the
electricity benchmark the thrust needs
to be at one and no anti grab but then
you can't move right yeah or what are
the fuel options so then the fuel
options for heat the only thing that
generates heat is the mass generator and
the thrust what about the flares I mean
I'm sure the flames can be but my
scanners gonna so as soon as my thrust
is that one if you go really slow maybe
can you putter along hold on I can
stabilize you
yeah all right
right stop moving dot this is the no I'm
stabilized motion it just happens no and
you're still too hot just have one
thruster too hot okay
hmm
we could try another cup the engines the
engines at the last moment see them I
don't think a will but that's right yeah
I'm ready
no not even a little bit not even a
little bit
oh I voted for Koto's yes the game is is
co-op is one screen cops'll I'm
controlling like what power goes to one
and Rich's steering and yeah taking care
of other stuff so it's it's a one screen
co-op game okay hold on turning engines
on okay
okay scanners taking up electricity so
right now electricity is being taken up
by the thrust anti grab and decelerate
er we don't need the D stellarator at
all so I'll turn that off turn
anti-graft to one but then we just won't
move go anywhere you can move a little
bit now right but yeah we're still in
the red even moving a little bit can you
move a little bit now time to these
things up is there right now that one
anti-gravity and we're barely under the
threshold turning up to three on the
thrust nope what I'm not moving though
it's fine sure I want to see if I could
stop moving thing sure cut cut along
putt-putt alone yeah
then work didn't work okay let's try
this again want to be our navigator
we're we're we're both playing this game
at the same time you know something one
shift so I'm I control like power to the
engines and riches like steering and
like shooting flares and stuff we could
have a navigator if you felt like
navigating no pressure don't worry about
it okay okay
we need to do here okay wait I know cuts
a cut scanner that's number one because
that takes up electricity hmm
what if I take deceleration down thrust
all the way down an anti grab all the
way up no no that kills us okay drift it
in there oh you drifted in it okay okay
okay okay okay okay
so I think I've just makes you go up
yeah and then it uses too much
electricity just by itself but here
we're fine but there's no thrust at all
can you switch between anti-gravity Rep
Italy huh
I'll wait in here hold on I want to try
to like buoyant us out here hold on I
think
this can't be the right puzzle can you
but one thrust is okay or one antigrav
is okay right
am I correct yeah well even right now
I'm at for anti grab an assign but as
soon as you hit that thruster it'll go
red can you switch between and you grab
and thrust like give me a de Graaff
thrust any redress integrate first let's
experiment down here
like can you do that can you turn the
antigrav and switch between that with
rust no well keeping us in the green no
okay
but we might be able to do I'm going not
the right direction here what's that
what's that what's that what do we just
do what was that yeah oh no we're just
we're just way so basically here's what
I'm wondering yeah now let go this is
what we need to do okay so we can drift
we can drift so we have one thruster
actually I could probably even turn it
up to like two thrusters this is what we
need to do all right the end this anti
graph makes us buoyant oh wow so
basically as soon as you hit the red
zone knock off the thruster alright and
we should be good to go okay we did it
we have turbo fire soon huh no no you
just stop hitting the thruster can I
steer like this no turns off try
everything off
um huh huh huh oh sorry sorry I see that
now
I didn't want to turn everything off I
know what's happening now
are we sent through this huh wait no
through what oh oh no oh no we gotta be
outside okay
hold on now scanner off deceleration off
antic arrived at three thrust at two
electric engines on okay I have control
of the anti graphs we are ready to go
cut engine on engine I'm okay good give
me give you back my my flirt I'm not
gonna need the floor I've just like that
whoa okay oh yeah we might want scanners
back scanners back okay they seem to be
attractive to the scanners the weird or
the weird look this good it's like a
yeah this whole thing is very body ish
like I said is originally an inner space
game like style and I'm necessarily
unlicensed right Oh could you give me
more power I can give you a bunch more
power you are now in max anti grab here
here's more thrust
Maxo Rustom Andy Grove okay hold on
Wow that I use too much power let's try
fuel engines okay now get more juice
give me more oh my god I tried to give
you more juice but I turned it off oh my
god I have so many concussions Wow
already okay okay maximum juice maximum
juice and we're doing it we're through
Oh Mike I'm gonna pull up we're gonna
pull up got everything okay wait we're
just back here now oh wait a book oh
that's right we had a button what now
what do we do back here
there's shit over here this thing high
fives all around
that was great
oh we figured it out everything's happy
nothing is happy everything is doom
