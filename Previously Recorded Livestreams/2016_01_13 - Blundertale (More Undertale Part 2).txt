would write oh there are my hair is
what's yellow fire my guess I don't know
I don't know you survived that get up
she's sweet jeebus Christ
which what what do rich-rich I what do
think about Rocksteady into new Ninja
Turtles
he's stupid just like he wasn't the old
cartoon look when it comes to the
turtles of a comic-book guy an old
black-and-white comic book guy bebop and
rocksteady I don't give a shit they're
stupid I can't I can't
here's the thing I can't appreciate a
villain that's just too stupid and
incompetent they're not a good villain
at that point they're just Schmucks yes
this is why I hate cartoons Skeletor and
when I played with my toys
Skeletor was nothing like he was in the
cartoon I'm winning crop which in run
away I couldn't possibly be menacing
Rondo stupid oh hi so the Blazers all
these here the blue lasers won't hurt
you if you don't move orange ones oh
yeah you have to be moving and they pave
the way they well they they they won't
move through those ones it's like a good
goodbye
that's a youth orange you have to move
for once you don't move for blue okay
um do you think rush can I do the kraang
voice once again not up Turtles cartoon
guy I don't know if I can do the crane
voice because I'm not not as fluent in
80s Turtles cartoon it's just my pitch
there's something robot voice in the new
Turtles cartoon we will be standing in
the thing where we stand in the place
where we stand in the thing yes that's
music that's amazing
what
shit
was toys Skeletor a three-dimensional
villain from a rich well I was young
enough I don't know if he was
three-dimensional but he was at least
menacing he wasn't a coward who would
who would run away yeah
you just missed
whole bunch noodles
now they're talking about Thundercats
Thundercats hadn't eaten villains and
meet villains in general yeah
but the Thundercats themselves are so
fucking lame
I couldn't never get into that show yeah
lion-o was a dumb boring motherfucker
every other every every hero on that
show was a dumb boring motherfucker and
snarf was like super Jar Jar before Jar
Jar
that's how bad snarf was fuck you snarf
you know who I can do a really good
impression of what snake us the northern
door will stay locked until you solve
the puzzles I'm on the right and left
eye I think she could go do that to the
right first
the way to work is blocked and so I had
time to catch mettaton show on my phone
the special effects were amazing today
that human almost looked real medicine
yeah he's the most populist on the
underground his hand glove probably has
at least two no three dozen members I
grew up in the are these days a is's I
grew up in the early 80s but I was
always a gargoyles fan yeah D'Argo's was
a great job I liked it at the time I
rewatched some of it recently I don't
remember why but I've ever watched some
of it recently yeah I think we were all
basically just seduced by by Keith David
okay cuz he's just he has a phenomenal
fucking voice the show was okay okay re
watching it I have not seen it since a
child it wasn't amazing really good
compared to a lot of other cartoons it
was great okay
what
Riker and Troy voiced on gargoyle yeah a
lot of team and basically everybody had
an appearance on gargoyles from TNG at
some point except for Patrick Stewart
and I think that's because he wanted
money generally speaking I'm gonna guess
they wanted him to play the Macbeth the
the Scottish kind of Shakespearean one
does Patrick Stewart is Patrick Stewart
Shakespearean actor oh yeah and I'm
gonna guess he said my one more than
this what are you offered me this
pittance for you'd be gone with you but
the rest of your ghost as indeed I don't
give a shit they suck but I think that's
why I watched it in the first place
finally turned up that later now we're
friendly we can well oh you little black
belief is repetitive representative lay
with me there
you read my mind by the way I was gonna
do that before you start alright
something like no it's fine it just
obviously that's the voice that
character should be really hard to do
rich what do you think about the
chipmunks I love the chipmunks do you
also hate the chipmunks
no I like the Chipmunks and I was a kid
so bucks is fine Alvin no and yes and

other famous Chipmunks they sure ain't

ignore it listen Luke ever since the
movie started to get good publicity
George Lucas has been doing everything

subscribing we really appreciate it
it's true we really do it's really the T
