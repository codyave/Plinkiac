purge here man friend lists rich I just
started Voyager does it get better
not really every now and then every now
and then there's a good episode or an OK
episode but the show it it delights
hovering up and down above the
mediocrity line that's fair that's a
really fair analysis it's like you you
you you take this great premise and then
you proceed to not do anything
interesting with it yeah
and then you take Kate Mulgrew who was a
who's an amazing actress was born to
fucking play a Starfleet captain God she
was and then you just write her horribly
inconsistently where where sometimes
she's the ultra idealist who won't Bend
no matter what and then other times
she'll she'll compromise her ideal so
that her favorite crew member can have a
cracker I born employee captain rich oh
isn't that frustrating yeah she'd be
she's a great captain she could be she
is like in my in my cannon in my head
cannon for Voyager there's a he's great
there's a clip float around there if you
ever see had that that clip with the
actress they originally hired she filmed
for one day they got wherever go she's
got this thick thick French accent
really yeah what is it what is it what
are they thinking who makes these
decisions man
here's what here's what I'm about to do
for anyone who is not steamed friends
with me and we're gonna play I'm gonna
play with the chat later I'm doing a
quick friend purge here of my Steam
friend list and then I'm going to okay
so we are going to remove these friends
okay and then we're gonna take all these
and take all these new invites and I'm
gonna ignore all the invites
ignore all boom so now in you know
invite me to friends here we go now
let's play some pub GD what you do
theory I open something open
how do we turn the sound down we're
getting out of here for something else
er I was energy one of them
how terrible how utterly terrible
they're rich when when they redid that
scene yeah Kate Mulgrew yeah they they
left instead of like with the old
captain's like hands touching buttons oh
they didn't refill everything well yeah
yeah so every every minute every minute
counts right oh that was just awful yes
I know she was terrible
somehow she made it to the set I'm the
first day of filming right right
good
good what are we talking about the the
original Kathryn Janeway on Voyager they
filmed for one day with a different
actress and she was so terrible they
fired her after one day
yeah she was crazy and then they had the
RiRi filmed a bunch of stuff because
they wanted to change Mulder's hair
they actually quit because she knew she
couldn't handle it now no that's not how
that's not that's not how I work that's
not that's what they said so everyone so
everyone could say face they'll say Oh
so-and-so left yeah okay first of all
why would you believe it would you hear
something like that especially after
watching the clip of her falling some of
these producers are human beings they're
not trying to murder somebody's career
so they let them save face right now
though they decided not to do it when
they had a discussion behind the scenes
this isn't working look at these dailies
this yeah we need to change the cast we
need to get someone else listen with the
dailies were really bad we we had we had
our editors throw together a rough edit
of this scene it's awful yeah we need to
recast immediately can we get Colombo's
wife
can we get mrs. Columbo Kate Kate
Mulgrew was on it was mrs. Klein I'm
done for sweating the chat no I'm
letting the chat know it's gonna take me
a little bit to see if all my buttons is
working
his name is in the main menu oh yeah I'm
I'm harlech H ARL ACK that is my steam
name and I have like a Yelp a yellow
picture with a little robot guy who has
an octopus arm that's my picture
good give me my backpack great so we
don't get the new map right off the bat
that's all right
oh it's random yeah yeah it's random hmm
old map new map everyone just choosing
new map you know
well at first some people would probably
still like the old ones the font of them
happened oh that map well and they have
added stuff to this map like there's a
ton more there's more like forest areas
and I want to say they added a new town
like they've added stuff to this map
okay which is very nice it's basically
just a warm-up for me I'm probably gonna
suck but you guys know that I probably
suck anyways so I heard somewhere the
actress quit because she thought the
role was beneath her you you might be
confusing stories you know you know the
story behind Jeffrey hunter and Star
Trek Jeffery oh yeah crest Captain
Christopher Pike in in the cage right he
was he was originally gonna be the
captain of the enterprise in Star Trek
and one day his wife comes in and talks
to Gene Roddenberry and says Jeffrey
hunter
is a movie star and he will not be doing
your show so because of Jeffrey Hunter's
wife Jeffrey hunter did not do Star Trek
and because he was doing movies he was
filming some kind of movie in Europe but
he died the car accident shortly
thereafter so if he took the role of
Captain Pike he may still be alive today
oh yeah
but he was a movie star Jack that's true
rich I've heard that about him what was
he need one of the most iconic roles of
all time for you don't just don't
rich well but now of course no one knew
that at the time yeah I would love to
see an alternate universe where they
made Star Trek with Jeffrey hunter would
have been totally I've been a little bit
more serious about you'd be a little
different
mm-hmm
I really like him in the cage sure sure
interesting what else would I know
Jeffrey hunter from uh he was Jesus and
the greatest story ever told
movie about Jesus well I died first of
all yes sumed
I haven't seen that sure he's probably
better in other things but there remain
forums there all before our time sure
these things it's probably in westerns
sure that era first of all everyone was
in a Western he probably played a dozen
different cowboys range that's a good
one yeah I'll get this one that has a
better better effective range that's why
I'm making that decision because it has
a better effective range alright tips oh
wait you were reading tips though right
I was reading some tips remember where
you left off I do not uh-huh
so there the last one I remember you
reading was to be underwears woman okay
oh yeah that sounds about right
did you read the one of a Martin
Scorsese no II don't
kendos says hey guys did you read what
Martin Scorsese wrote about Rotten
Tomatoes a couple months back he said
the site is turning us into on
adventurous consumers and is bad for
film criticism your thoughts interesting
I I don't have much thoughts like in
general I just don't have much thoughts
they call me old blank slate Evans
that's that's what they call me you know
it's one of those things where I I think
no matter what you have people who are
looking for aggregation
you have people who are looking for
someone to tell them if they will like
it or not I think I think people think
Rotten Tomatoes makes people see or not
see movies but I don't think that's the
case at all or nobody would see a movie
like the Suicide Squad right so maybe
irritating and and the way they give
movies of fresh or rotten rating might
be flawed but I don't know that it's
ruining anything I think it's easily
ignore about yeah because I don't I
don't know that they actually have that
much influence I'm with you man yeah you
know what I would love is a fucking
police vest up in this video that's what
I would love also I'm gonna need a car
I'm fairly close to the circle and
there's a button I need to change but I
don't necessarily want to change it yet
have I seen Leonard Nimoy's bilbo
baggins song everybody's seen that Oh
Bilbo Baggins I would rather have an
oozy rich other camouflage outfits in
this and when they're ever not be a
reason to have a camouflage outfit there
are camouflage outfits in there and no
you want you want the camouflage outfit
to times go is that an unfair advantage
for the people who have that unlocked um
well it's something you can pick up well
what happened whoa it's something you
can pick up
I should probably like your blue shirt
might be a terrible idea that's possible
I don't think it matters that much there
is there's a findable in this game the
that like the grass suit you know that
thing I don't know that thing but this a
grass suit yeah there's a grass suit and
I've it's an incredibly rare find
oh fuck but if you can find that yeah
you're undetectable in like
these areas I got to find I got to find
a bush to sit in as soon as I get across
the line because my free look button
it's currently not is that a motorcycle
no that is a bush my free look button is
currently not set to anything and I want
that the blue prism says rich stop
playing this your blood pressure can't
handle it probably about getting it
definitely about getting over it
probably about depending on how stupidly
you play this maybe for this too rich I
play pretty stupid you gotta be careful
man Jack I think you should run around
and get someone's attention draw them
out of cover Jack draw them out of cover
cuz that always works anonymous says
which is better fateful findings or the
room my vote is for fateful findings oh
man that was actually some of the most
fun of the night was just comparing the
two because Neal Breen and Tommy Wiseau
have a lot in common
hey I might give it two fateful findings
I'll be honest with you yeah the the
most shocking thing about faithful
findings is hold on for a second was it
called free look I think bank vaults on
the crouch prone interacts free look at
isn't it I want you to be free look okay
close
is like there were scenes in fateful
findings that were clearly just Neil
Breen wants a hug from someone and you
just see like you know you like cuz you
can tell he's such a bad actor you can
tell when he's acting and then like
he'll hug someone and it just melts away
and like it's a real legitimate hug oh
poor Neil Breen he just wants to hug huh
all right all right now my free look is
jiggered tell me why so didn't fit in
the black tank top theory though I think
he's wearing a black tank top at some
point he wears a sleeveless black
sleeveless shirt during his like throw
the football with mark in the park yeah
montage here's okay when we're talking
about people with an ego making their
own movie yeah does you know part of the
whole black shirt thing you know it's
you know what's weird about the room and
tell me why so what usually they cast
themselves as an action star yeah
you know I'm the secret agent I'm the
hacker or the super hacker of course uh
Neil Breen tell me why so did not make
him he did not star himself in an action
movie he started himself in a drama
right he was the normal guy who had a
job and a girl that he wanted to get
married yeah what happened in Tommy's
life who broke Tommy's heart rich
everybody seen his face somebody
somebody broke that man's heart the book
kind of lets you in on that you know
that's that's that's his deal he doesn't
have friends
yep that's why in his movie everyone's
his best friend and we love Johnny
mm-hmm
we love Johnny so much and even even the
girl who's kind of iffy about me her
mother loves me
oh man that whole movie is fantastic but
like I said watching watching them
back-to-back was also just a ton of fun
the the the neoprene Tommy was so
situation what am I have 42 all right 42
coming from rich hey hey I've got
someone man and I got a whole bunch of
friends you know what you you actually
you literally wish you had my friends oh
damn yo that's why you're watching this
shit Dawg you're getting too real you're
bringing it you're bringing in what's
your man got to do with me I got a man
damn but yeah so it's it's it's all
fantasy fulfillment Ferb there's someone
for both timing was so n Neil Breen and
you know depending on their fantasy they
just want a stable relationship and best
friends or they want to be an
international hacker that takes down the
crooked government who also cuddles
people there's a lot of cuddling and
fateful findings
by the way by the way it's it was they
said oh well I would scrolled up a while
back yeah but somebody wanted my
thoughts on the the Dead Rising rumors
there's Dead Rising rumors rumors of a
new game that they are going back to
basics and it's effectively gonna be a
soft reboot for the franchise okay I've
heard about this uh-huh
especially going back to the timers I
didn't hear anything about combo weapons
which my book is a good thing okay and
and difficulty and just just classic
Dead Rising yeah you didn't like the the
combo weapons they start to get too
goofy
I'm sure way to goofy running around
using whatever's at your disposal just
like throwing a potted plant at a zombie
because that's all you got yeah
that's wacky fun but when you when you
when you literally tape a garden gnome
to some kind of stick and it makes a
wand that causes garden gnomes come out
of the ground that attack zombies you've
you've crossed a line
alright I'm with you I'm with you
I understand so I was never that big on
the combo uprising combo weapons couple
weapons yeah more marketing gimmick than
gameplay play sure you know I think a
little bit fun but it wasn't the main
draw for me it ever was okay that's fair
all right so I'm optimistic but one this
is just a rumor
it's absolutely just something someone
said on 4chan Oh like a developer hasn't
said anything not none of that nothing
official oh okay so and the other thing
yeah everything yeah you know good work
we're going back to there are roots
we're going back to what worked before
that's what they said before Dead Rising
four came out so grain of salt and a
little bit garden
they should make a less ugly Frank West
no Frank West works because he is ugly
he's a he's not a typical protagonist
Frank West I know I know that they think
I'm a Fran fan of Frank West buzz he's
some kind of hysterical meme generating
badass but that's not at all why I like
the character in the original game okay
he's not even he's not even that funny
he's Frank West is interesting because
he's not typical protagonist he's a
selfish reporter who's just looking to
get the scoop he's not in any way a hero
he is a schlub right he has a schlub who
foolishly gets himself in way over his
head and he's in over his head at the
start of that game and and he's
struggling to stay afloat the whole way
through the game
not even an empty hero more like neutral
like he's trying to be the reporter he
just wants the story he's not there to
save lives he's there to make money he's
not evil he'd probably preferred if
people didn't die sure but he's just
there to get his scoop so we could make
a name for himself for having the big
story if he's not a hero then why do you
save everyone when you play as him all
right
you notice in Dead Rising 1 they don't
call them missions they don't call them
escort mission they call them scoops in
Frank's eyes he's saving these people to
find out what their story is
sure oh fuck and yes you don't have to
save any of them it's entirely optional
that's true that's true but the real
ending is when you save all 50 survivors
no that is absolutely nothing to do with
the real ending the real endings when
you investigate the story and it has
nothing to do with rescuing anybody who
isn't a main story character involved
with getting information on the scoop
that girl knows what's going on I have
to save her yeah
he was he was on my six I didn't hear
him I didn't hear him
no I'm using my nunchuck and a mouse
this is basically WASD stick which is
easier for me to use and a mouse rich
does he escape the true ending with
Isabella and sell his story in your head
Canon that's not head Canon the text
after the game like the actual what
happened text flat-out says he did okay
so
oh here it I mean after you after you
beat Brock at the end of the game you're
you're literally standing on top of some
kind of fancy automated tank it's not
it's not hard to imagine how Franken
Isabella can get out I'm gonna give it
one more go for me and then we'll do
some squads okay do some squad hopefully
we can check out the desert map so he's
like an incidental hero yes that's
exactly what Frank quest is absolutely
that's a good way to put it yep Frank
sounds like an asshole yes
Oh old map again
old map again that fun
so Frank West is ash Williams
yes but less funny
interesting
okay Jack I'm late have you found the
updates this game more enjoyable
encephalopathy yes I find you know a lot
of the frustrations are still there like
what just happened where you know just a
random guy in a motorcycle just happen
to see me ran me over before I could
react and that's frustrating that's a
frustrating death but with the death cam
at least I know how I died and a lot of
times that can that can help me adjust
my personal strategy you know I look
around a lot more I'm a lot more
cautious entering buildings I look for
signs of of human occupancy you know
there's there's things that I can do to
adjust my strategy and so the deaths
feel less we're frustrated where is the
best point to get off on the point
there's no there's no best point I I
prefer to be as far the fuck away from
the plane as possible i I'm not shitting
you I have like seven kills and in one
run on this and I got off the plane near
the end I did not murder the people who
were just idle sure I wasn't murdering
them I did murder somebody who walked by
to kill the people who were idle nice I
ended up killing someone right after and
then it seemed like I was behind
everybody uh-huh I'm away to the circle
because I got off at the very end I was
at one end of the island yeah yeah and
so I was just murdering a bunch of
people coming out I'm basically from
behind that's why I like to get as far
away from people as possible give me a
little time to get my bearings and
hopefully everyone is then in front of
me yeah I had some good firefights
that's good there's a fun run and I died
then it felt like I was all for nothing
sometimes I think I made it to fit
though oh yeah that's that's satisfying
and it you know anytime you get that top
ten it's great anytime you get that top
ten it's good feeling
which I'm gonna see if I can stumble
upon a car here and then make my way
through the gun range that might be a
car it's about the journey rich so you
say so you say but when I died even
though I had what was a pretty good run
it felt like a letdown so sometimes your
journey sometimes sometimes the end is
pretty important got it you know if you
don't stick the landing your pole vault
was for shit
no car around here that sucks
pan
I would've got a second joke alright
mochi b85 says hi Wreckers hi jack if
you want a movie so bad it's good watch
wait before Mickey on Netflix so
hilariously bad and ham-fisted it's
great 50% of the film is weight crying
cuz he can't flip him wait crying cuz he
can't pay the bill smiley face emoji
okay okay alright good to know
damn it rich what do you think of
Castlevania I loved the first one when I
was kid hated the second one uh-huh
now must hated the second one or more
was confused by the second one I think I
think that's everyone I believe that
many of the other ones
like I thought three was fine it'll do
for now - maid says the fifth
anniversary of Metal Gear Rising is next
month on the 19th 2019 the 21st
worldwide which is on a stream day
wouldn't be nice to have a stream day
yeah maybe but also everything is
terrible says just saw hard-boiled by
John Woo and I think it fit on review
I'll review I thought you're gonna say
best of the worst for a second I don't
know why me personally I think
hard-boiled belongs on the perfect
action film list with ghostbusters
diehard Iron Man 3 etc thoughts
hard-boiled hard-boiled that's been it's
been a while yeah yeah
I wouldn't be a good one for because I'm
I'm not overly familiar with hardball
but apparently you're not either I don't
I don't know that any of us are uh-huh
you need a car that one's gonna say I
hate it even though I clearly I don't
why does rich hate hard no no because
I'm not overly familiar with it
get over your hate for hard-boiled
I love hard-boiled eggs does that count
huh that's my favorite kind of egg so
it's not a terrible film for a review I
just don't know that any of us are good
choices should we do a review of hard
boil then it's just me talking about
eggs and you know Jay Jay does not like
hard-boiled eggs at all and so like he
can be the counterpoint turn around
again there might have been somebody
behind you that blacked out no that's
just very yeah bushes bushes look like
people
like people everything is people how far
do you have to go not very I may I'll
make it in time maybe better if I had a
car or a helmet or a back shack should
you be running through the city at this
point people are probably running
towards the exits I'm feeling pretty oh
yeah none of these doors are open self
they make the low render versions of
bushes look like people they do just to
be dickheads which do you like your eggs
hard-boiled ah scrambled that's your
preferred egg yep hmm that's fair Oh
back back here we go you know that's
fair I'm not like I'm not gonna deny it
like any egg is a good egg but you know
I just I like if I had to choose just
one egg to have for the remainder of
eternity it would be a hard-boiled rich
why does it everyone think Aquaman is
lame because he's a under the ocean guy
and that's that's like limiting
maybe it's because he's super lame your
adventures need to take place in like a
pier or a boat or your Fighting's I'm
gonna fish things under the water yeah
kind of hard to latch onto that and
unless you are like a mariner like a
fish like unless you have a life by the
sea like if you're the son of a
fisherman like I bet you're super into
Aquaman this might be a bad idea but
there's a motorcycle here like I'm right
by the line there lose under the ocean
so
I wouldn't necessarily call Cthulhu
dynamic character he's a neat design and
a cool bad guy but and it doesn't exist
in the DC Universe shit fence
damnit damnit running away stop shooting
at me
you're gasps no wait right left other
side of the rock I saw a little top
moving where somewhere that way just
just get out of there just get the fuck
out of there I'm doing it why are you
taking the pike huh aren't you taking
the bus because then then they have a
clear shot I can't I can't shoot back
check you have no helmet don't take
these fights this is my only option at
the time you could just run away that is
an option running away is an option I
think that's a that makes me a bigger
target I feel right away yeah so now
that's a bullshit death but now we get
to see who killed me
and so it's like from behind you from
the houses you think nope nope okay so
yeah he's scoping out the rock that I
was behind if you had hair you know
foolish how did he see me he knew
exactly where to zoom in on me I suppose
this a chance somebody is saying there's
a lot of hacks could be some kind of aim
bond thing involved could be how did he
know I was hiding behind that rock to
his left how did he know to look over
there hold on let's watch that again oh
did you see that now what well I'll show
you in a second
that's to clean now where he I watched
this watch where he aims when he's
looking at the rock watch his reticle
like dude dude it like like snaps right
to where I am on the other side of the
fucking Hill I'll say it let's say I
didn't see that
that's I don't know man
no no Jack I don't know I know I don't
know that what so aimbots it'll just
like right away right unless they like
smooth the aimbot curve too I might
report this look look at look at like
right here it goes like I don't know
that it's the case
look it locks right there that's a lock
Jack trust me he's not cheating huh I
don't know agreed Jack is right for once
seems fairly normal I don't know it
seems weird that he knew I was way over
there okay okay people are saying don't
report him I don't I don't think you
have enough to go on here all right
that's fair that's fair
I have been reporting some people who
have suspicious behavior I see it locked
it looked like it zoomed right in on me
on the other side of the hill people are
saying they vote clean that's fair as a
multiplayer fun where you can have this
discussion well I guess a friend
requests to get to
Oh Pretender says Jack dime jack
what do you think of Ridley Scott trying
to get a third Blade Runner movie going
as long as Ridley Scott doesn't direct
it I'm okay with it
how about that yeah how about that rich
why don't you like left for dead
well thematically I'm not that fond of
fast zombies okay
and I'm not much of a multiplayer guy in
general right but that's not that's not
really competitive no no it's
cooperative no no the same way I might
enjoy
you might it's my age it's good it's
intense
I'm turned off by the fast zombies I'm
sure but that that doesn't necessarily
say anything about gameplay right I
think I think it's good I think it's
intense one second here it does look
like something that would get old
wait don't people play a super zombies
to them maybe that's another mom okay
that's that's a different mode
rich you may like seven days to die semi
slow zombies maybe too much waiting for
you though I I do like turn-based
strategy and that's not exactly
fast-moving but what kind of what kind
of game is seven days to die
okay
so how do we do this how do we join up
with a group
did rich ever play dayz I mean I didn't
ever play it but aren't the zombies kind
of meaningless isn't dayz basically just
pub G only with zombies
built the ultimate zombie game is Dead
Rising it's got the Romero vibe sure
alright there we go
four four man team boom yep you guys
ready
you have an area that isn't inherently
spooky but it's still the horror
elements don't care about that they're
there anyway mhm yeah I think you could
get some real enjoyment out of left for
dead maybe that's maybe that's what we
could play together okay okay that it
left for dead is some good shit
somebody's trying to get a rise out of
me by saying dead rising isn't a fun
game though oh it's fine they can try
that think I mean obvious obvious I mean
you can have that opinion and I don't
care it doesn't change the fact that
Dead Rising 1 is like literally one of
my favorite games of all time right hey
can you guys hear me and I started
playing the the PC version in the first
game I've already I've already cently
the last week or two but I've already
got 41 hours in terrible terrible and
wonderful hey Beyonce type and how what
how's it going
and where's mobile mark yeah we can hear
you out here any of you Dead Rising
encourages exploration then punishes you
for exploit Dead Rising sucks if you
play it like a game you're only supposed
to play once and only once
hello no new map yet yep and in in Dead
Rising 1 you're you're supposed to get
bodied and fail either the some of the
side quest or the main story but you
know what in Dead Rising 1 if you like
failed the story one of if you fail any
of the timed events yeah you know what
happens a screen comes up and says you
failed the story the school call you can
continue it or hold it for a second
let's go to the rock quarry you can you
can lo to save hello or you can just
keep playing and level up some more yeah
and explore on them all and do whatever
you want yeah yeah there's a lot you can
do there is nothing to stop you from
exploring and Dead Rising 1 unless
you're gonna be really anal about well
I'm only gonna play once and only once
and I need to be perfect the first time
apparent we've jumped out apparently I'm
following a mobile Marshall yep you have
to approach dead rising like Groundhog
Day we're all gonna die
yay like Groundhog Day yeah I felt it
this time I know what I can do different
next time and then you get better and
then you carry your level carries over
you get to level 12 when you restart the
game you start at level 12 yeah
the escort missions really suck a Dead
Rising they're entirely optional every
cent of them except for like one or two
that are involved with the main story
but they're unusually easy ones oh crap
I'm dead you're dead already
I'm dead
shit we got a dead teammate already
there's someone on my six oh no I don't
know if you can hear me at all I can I'm
not on your six gotta find it huh gotta
find some shit escort missions suck in
every game see the thing with Dead
Rising the thing with the thing is bad
in and escort missions and games in
general it's a game over if you fail
success in I died in Dead Rising except
for the like like to affirmation main
story based ones which are under these
your side yeah
if you fail an escort if somebody that
you're escorting dies you just keep
going yeah it's not a game over okay so
next time we we need to get a better
game plan
I wanted to go to the rock quarry
crispy-fried manses you like to complain
about Chakotay troll and Voyager but I
submit to you a challenge if you were
writing a scripture how would you
implement a Native American character
into the main cast well he would be the
second officer and would Butthead with
Jane way over over policies and maybe
his Maquis background would be more of a
sense of friction between the two and he
wouldn't just instantly have become a
Starfleet member oh you notice that his
culture doesn't need to be tracked on in
a tacky way he can just be a Native
American playing a role but see here's
the thing rich you could you could
actually implement his culture being a
culture who historically big government
has done his people wrong that could
actually play up his Maquis
characteristics it's true he's true he
could use that within butting heads with
Jane we're like hey let the last time my
people trusted the government what
happened right right right that would
work - that would work - you you just
you know have him be a consistent
character all right let's go again guys
but this time let's stay together all
together now we got to stay together to
me it's more insulting you're the Native
American guy you go on a Vision Quest
this episode that's more insulting to me
yeah agreed
is your chat setting on I have no idea
if my chat setting is on the off switch
Ike I can't hear you though seven switch
Dead Rising game do you recommend the
first time we're starting with well I
love the first one the death so I would
say one though
boys you know the answer is probably two
because it's a lot easier baby it still
has escort missions but basically the
survivors just run straight through
Boreum safehouse and they don't really
require any kind of babysitting
it's not even beat on this attack so two
is probably a lot more forgiving okay
all right so should I just shut up I'll
probably shut up this run you have to
shut up for a little bit you started you
started a game when I was in the middle
of a dead rising rent and I'm very sorry
about that alright hey guys let's wait
until we are let's wait until the plane
kicks us out okay that's the plan we're
gonna go all the way to the end of the
island and make our way across
so just wait till we get to the very
edge like don't even hit it Jax wait
till the plane autumn Auto ejects us and
we'll just you know find a house on our
way down awesome games done quick yeah
yeah yeah they're doing a quick charity
event no I'm checking out like at home
oh yeah yeah yeah I can't hear you at
all I'm gonna jump when you jump
whenever that is you can't hear me at
all so this is defaulting to my
microphone I mean does that make sense
is it something that can't happen no
they would be able to hear both ways cuz
they both go through the zoom are you
hearing me and not jack yeah I've got a
stream on to make sure I can hear you
but I don't think I can hear you in-game
you might need to change your your team
chat settings to always we could check
our settings I did and I did we're good
that's not my teammate
that's not my team if there's another
guy in here the other players can hear
him in game right so what's on that
guy's end yeah come here I'm gonna punch
the shit out of you dude I'm armed with
vertical grip I'm chasing someone I'm
chasing someone I'm gonna punch him to
death I have a hand grenade I'm coming
to ya watch out folks I'm just gonna
punch this dude until he dies welcome to
me I got shotgun
unless you get a weapon this is not
going to work t-bag I'm Jack can you
duck yeah we did it all right so now we
are very far away oh shit oh yeah I hear
you end of the lay in the stream

car priority at the moment off switch do

I've been getting into board games
lately yeah actually one person for gun
gonna round every girl who's somebody
killed me oh look at that guy
that's a cool looking gun do you have
any two-player game recommendations for
my life and I can be co-op or
competitive for board games the
two-player games that I play with my
wife we've been really getting into
underlings of underwing mm-hmm which is
uh like a dragon
raising game look at this gonna look at
this gun then it has its own name that's
my full-on machine gun yeah ah that's
that's that's that's top quality shit
there
oh yeah that's a powerful machine gun so
underlings muttering has a really good
two-player mode and actually it has a
single-player like it has a solitaire
mode as well sitting saucer this gun
right look at it didn't need that
ammunition all you need is twenty three
bullets
how many people are left alive 65 all I
need is 23 bullets so that's a really
good one underlings wondering we you
know I have talked about this before but
Lisa and I are obsessed with Marvel
legendary the the deck building game and
that has a good to play mode we play
you're the underdog story man you you
can do it how what you can do it you got
a badass helmet and gun mhm that gives
you a fighting chance
absolutely we play time barons a lot
that's a two-player game
you can do it jack install some cheats
no yeah I ain't no cheater
I do live on stream - that's a scam to
make people with the machine gun
yeah I'm listening to you all through
the twitch chat so I'm just kind of
delete oh sure you're doing great you're
doing great how what which right
oh you can make it you can make it you
can make it you can make it everybody's
watching you don't get too stressed out
the whole world is waiting on you oh
there's only 59 people and you have 40
bullets you're so good you're so good
look a couple of them line up you got
this so far to go oh my god you have so
far to go you got to find a car man get
yourself to a road look at the outsides
where you want to be the outsides where
you want to be that's true unless you
are outside of the blue circle then you
don't want to be there it's get a
motorcycle there might be got a cars and
garages and not safe and the best bets
just run name mm-hmm I like how Jack
can't be bothered to fix his in-game
chat issue it's not my issue other
people can hear me I believe it's how
what's issue we don't know what it is
but it is not my issue chat get over it
yeah yeah yeah well yeah I didn't say
that but yeah here we go there you go
found a car making it happen making my
way downtown walking fast places pass
yes I'm home bye make sure nobody's
using it yeah the check thing is my
problem I bet if I restart my game it'll
work
let's go die yay
die
oh this is exciting
see technically this is still my team so
how won't wind that's still a chicken
dinner
how come you didn't come to the last one
you got a team you can do that way that
doesn't say clear perfect perfect you
doing it you might be able to knock it
down
what flip it over
that's great well you made it a little
farther so that's something
doing it
valiant bloodshot's hey guys my valiant
legend just got back for what till you
get to cover free start ticking show us
ma g Fest this weekend and son demo for
a game called route it looks like cross
between Tron 2.0 and Far Cry Blood
Dragon it's on Steam now rich might like
it okay I think I've seen I've seen
trailers for that not heard of it I
think another one here circles closing
in okay okay let's not flip this one
while York just barely beaten that
circle you can do it don't you don't
have to hit the gas all the time take it
easy take it easy take it easy and don't
flip I think is the top priority great
doing great
we take it easy take it easy I know
where I want to go I want to go right
here all right
nice nice doing it I wish I had a sniper
he picked up anytime scope didn't you
does that not go on somebody somebody
your left how what car to your left on
TS southeast like West even
come on this hey you got it you did it
you did it everything's fine
we just know that we're all watching and
judging the spot I'm going to is nice I
can see all the way around Oh
wishing
they do that's why they shot at you oh
not Flint all right take your time check
out the house
slow down someone could be in there
oh my sweet Jesus
this time it's lupus is Jack yeah
this tip is C you add Mia's friend and
stream so we can play some pub loads
being judged I promise I will not
accidentally friendly-fire you that's
your stick I'll do another after this
one I'll do another friend accepting
there's nobody here nobody here that's
what they want over there
right
this can't be better with a smaller map
and fewer people know there I like the
amount there is to explore in the map
it's every section of the map is its own
little map and the the scale of it is
impressive it's just if I don't like a
game would be bad a small or not better
I think the map size is pretty good how
it is there are other takes on this
anyone's really big and there's no
vehicles what if instead of a shrinking
map every 10 minutes is beautiful you go
ten minutes got a kill you show up as a
dot on the map another radar see ya like
that yeah I think there are different
modes to be explored in this like we
like we talked about the beans mode yeah
you have to kill people to get a can of
beans
yeah well the 10 minute radar blood
might work better
mmm-hmm 10 minutes and then you show up
yeah now you're a target kill somebody
before against campers
yeah I mean this is roots to come to me
the shrinking map is to discourage
people from camping but I think like if
you died of a and that's why you need to
kill people for beans a can of beans
only last you know two minutes or
whatever and that and then like rate
that you get a radar blip to see where
people are every whatever it be it'd be
a different game I think there's more to
explore in the world of player unknowns
battlegrounds leading both dropped
realistic well at least that person is
very scared ha one you scared the crap
out of them so you know we got that
going for us
maybe gunfire shit out of temporaries
not as well you don't want to punish
sniping too much they don't or could
just get out of there med kids rush your
Jeep
yeah Jeep still ready to go get back at
your car man doing kidding you cheap man
fudge out of there elope take the
vehicle head back to circle blood though

brilliant strategy we're gonna hide in
some bushes guys it's gonna be great you

can see you for miles you will draw so
many people out of cover when you're on
fire yeah they won't even know what hit

tip we're coming to you I said oh oh my

wanted to go oh my god well the other
person sensibly thought you're gonna
land somewhere under with a plane and
they didn't know you're gonna try and
fly this is where I said I wanted to go
and look I made it
easy-peasy you're the other side of
everybody else is it my fault they
didn't follow the plan

very well thought-out plan thank you

actually running farther away I
shouldn't do that I should probably run
towards them I finished like third and I
didn't see anyone until I was shot

okay yep I'm going towards the marker
thank you
oh gee it's fine fine fine
Oh time at time I'm a good driver
okay
is this it was like disappointing
moments in this game was finding out
that you could not drive a truck oh
right you can't what you cannot drive a
tractor or a bicycle like there's bikes
hanging around and you can't drive a
bicycle either let me need ya graphic
sight in here if anybody needs it
yeah is that a vehicle yes have you
never heard a vehicle before where's the
holographic sight it's right down here I
got a quick dropper and keep your eye
out for people I heard that that car and
that I don't hear anymore which implies
that somebody got out of the vehicle and
they're now wandering around with guns
bolting in the mapup somebody another
gun silenced yeah now want that to be
your first weapon of choice well this is
this is my this is my oh shit gun for uh
for like in case someone surprised me
I'll just spray them okay the other one
is my is my think about shooting people
gun if I could get a two time scope or
something don't get too far away from
anyone else oh shit
filling this little farm
all right we're getting close to one
all right leave banning the place or
what I don't see anything else here well
where's where's the next one spawning
we're about to find out let's go these
houses are keep on searching for better
weapons okay it's right on the way dudu
we're doing great
feel like we're doing great still alive
right all three of us that started the
game oh hey we're we're at 75 percent
that's pretty good that's a neat touch
all right here we go here we go here we
go here we go here we go getting intense
on the new map you can drive minivans
I'm dying to see this new map its it
supposedly exists that it is pretty cool
overall do we have any people someone's
here
where
southeast hundred and thirty
top of the hill yeah they're going that
way away from us yeah but I shot at them
so that they might be coming towards me
okay
they're still here still on the hill or
they come towards the house is there
still one out there he's coming around
yet he's walking around the house jack
okay can I get you I'm crawling towards
you
he'll help watch it watch it
Suns coming coming it wasn't bad I
killed a couple people you did no I
think I accident I think I accidentally
hit the that stupid what do you call the
sensitivity - sensitivity button and so
like it wasn't moving as fast as I want
ah
Jax pan oh I know I definitely panicked
but that didn't die right away yeah oh
yeah this is hold on there we go blue is
what we're looking for here hey let's do
one more let's do it let's do one more
at least with this group yeah let me
take a little break to go to bathroom
sir anyway you can you can force it to
play that goddamn other map I don't owe
her a thing you can clip for preference
yes ask the chat while I go to bed
chan I'm waiting for responses is there
any way to at the very least increase
the odds of getting the desert map nope
keep quitting too you get it that seems
lame
as everyone on the team updated well I
do not know I know it is really odd that
we have not gotten the new map yet
but odds can be funny like that I mean
you can flip a coin you get you can get
heads ten times in a row
it's a blad MCU music is not in
guardians of the galaxy
which are you good at this game I'm not
very good at multiplayer shooters I I
don't enjoy them and therefore I I don't
get much practice with them it's like a
feedback loop the the honest truth is
the absolute honest truth is I prefer my
shooters to be just power fantasies and
multiplayer is built on balance and it
being fair for everybody but you're
playing Call of Duty where if you just
play more you get the better weapons to
start with by grinding but regardless
regardless I perform my shooters to be
more like doom
wish list for doom - I don't want more
doom i I don't I I don't have a wish
list I'm curious to hear what they're
going to do with it and I guess new
enemy types wish for what doom - oh yeah
more guns more enemies more violence
alright alright oh maybe maybe some
zombie soldiers that are more
reminiscent of the classic doom zombie
men unless like the big goofy monsters
with the energy blast I don't know sure
sure sure
doom on earth and make it jr. I like
that make it do me er well it'll
probably be on earth they'll probably go
that route sure sure
alright let's see if we get the new map
new map new map new map no whammies no
whammies no whammies you're going to be
the big badass who everyone is it on
yeah oh oh we're on fire again no new
map we're just gonna play until we get
that new map oh wait that's too much
that's not enough that's too much
that remember that big sword from the
very end of doom where the artifact
turns out it's actually just a big
glowing red sword yeah I would love that
to be an upgrade for the chainsaw tell
me that wouldn't be awesome that would
kind of be awesome like halfway through
the game you recover that and it's your
new chainsaw weapon okay Oh metal van no
we got middle VIN who are we missing
jack this server is lagging
Jack yeah we the server's lagging so you
might have lost one of our teammates Oh
No well then it's just the three of us
Lex why what I said we can restart and
try getting back yeah okay sure let's
let's all exit to lobby okay
exiting do we remember who it was no
who's my teammate I do not
oh hey there there van Duren metal
villian alright let's try again come on
y'all let's do it that's okay van Duren
we're here
we're here and now we got a second
chance at desert map go desert map go

desert man I hear crickets
I hear crickets oh no dang it
