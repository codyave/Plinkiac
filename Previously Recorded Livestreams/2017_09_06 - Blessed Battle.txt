Oh even though like I did a really bad
thing
I didn't retitle the stream so a lot of
people are gonna get an email now and
it's not going to say the right thing
that we're playing what Mario Rabbids
yeah well I think they're gonna want to
see this rich one once they know what it
is and - it's even better because now
they don't know what it is yeah rich has
no idea what we're playing also rich is
quiet what what rich is quieter than I
am
hold on figure this yeah yeah lots of
static on audio
or are we getting or were we getting
audio from the camera what what out of
the gate right out of the gate when I
tap it it goes away is that a compressor
thing there we go hey who wants some uh
some technical difficulties right off
the bat here we go now you should be
able to hear both of us well how about
some converse um confirmation that you
can hear both of us
yeah okay great okay so here's what we
got
chat I have not told rich the name of
the game we are playing he doesn't know
the game we're playing you don't know
what game we're playing I wanted to keep
it a secret from everyone right now I'm
just doing a display capture so you can
watch the trailer for the game that
we're gonna play live with rich Evans I
write I hope I'm frightened I hope I
hope you did get are you ready to watch
the trailer all right for the game here
we go okay
Oh since that game where the gods fight
each other the one that I had to get
censored they didn't like Shiva being
portrayed the way Shiva traditionally
was portrayed I don't think that's this
arises Oh God Oh God yeah yeah it was on
a sale on Steam yesterday and it for a
ridiculously cheap price Jesus has the
cross still attached to his hands and he
uses it to fight and it looks like it's
gonna be a good time so we are going to
play fight of gods we are going to play
fight of gods which I am frankly pretty
excited about all right turn that off
for now all right so we'll get this game
started this is so bad yeah and
obviously like I don't know if this is
gonna take up the entire stream but I
thought it was funny enough where we
might be able to get some comedy out of
this
now hold on for a second because I
forgot to update chaddy
my bad news display capture for that
yeah did you switch it to game I I'm
about to do that right now fight of
let's see here fight of dogs fight of
grodd's what just happened everything's
what's the name of the stream rich fight
of or how about dent how about no how
about this I said battle up up down down
left right God what do you come up with
the worst thing huh the worst thing
the well you know what this is called
rich spitballin I'm spitballing ideas up
up down down left right God like blessed
battles better okay I didn't hear that
sorry I was I'm spitballing religious
Rumble Oh see getting uh getting the old
and the old brain holy war that's great
what is this called again fight
update my main man geez right
okay we are updated there you go have a
laptop we are going to play fight of
gods are we doing this to player to
start with or well yeah or you know one
of us will check it out neither of us
gonna have the laptop if someone has to
be both have to have a controller
Madeline you know boy Bible thump oh
that's good bible thump Bible thump yeah
this work was inspired by cultures and
stories from around the world
in mortal combat
I prefer Bible thump in moral combat
immoral combat it's like two jokes
layered on top of each other weirdly or
dori then you just called moral combat
yeah immortal works
no immoral plays what I'm saying moral
combat
yeah but they're immortal so instead of
mortal combat it's immortal combat oh
sure
I like moral combat better why why
because that's their supposed to have
his morals
I was skipping this course giving this
so we can get to fullscreen action now
we played Mario yesterday Jack did not
update the title before we started which
is a mistake I have made many different
times
push the graphics to the best certainly
boom watch the stream crash ya chansons
a type divine judgment oh well you know
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna test it
out it's got a normal difficulty hell
dude I just wanna like you kind of gotta
play as Jesus right away don't let you
look at that look at that the Blues is
there Wilson okay so guys ooze okay you
got Buddha kind of our place Buddha you
have Guan gong I don't know who that is
you have Odin random Athena classic
classic Moses oh never mind I'm playing
as Moses with the Ten Commandments on
his back
is that a nubes yeah it's hard to choose
their Anubis looking good I'm a - I'm no
idea I'm a Taurus ooh
and I'm being Moses first I'll be oh
I'll be real with you oh he's got
different skin or you can unlock
different skins yes I'm assuming that's
Yahweh in the middle no that's random
Halas random random surely Yahweh is
unlockable I think that's Whitney
never really right it's it's there's no
one who you ask
image rights Holy Trinity a little bit
Moses apparently he's a God now Jesus is
God well not not if you're Jewish or a
Muslim not if it is not the embodiment
of God but if you're a lot of religions
yeah but just a prophet some people
think he was just a guy just a dude some
people aren't even sure he was right no
Satan right oh yeah you need a Satan
there's no real evidence outside of the
bottle outside of the Bible for Jesus
existence
probably should have looked up looking
for like like some kind of like Roman
census data or something right not non
non Bible letters or anything
referencing him
where is Inu maybe in an update
I've been down for Xenu this is this is
early access that something should know
oh how do you do special shit I really
should have looked that book at the
causeway Oh smack to you with the
commandments I'm hoping that jacking
button math my way through but I
absolutely cannot special special
special
here we go oh the holy light the holy
lady fills me
all right I got my I got my head strikes
now I got my mad my mad Moses scrat's
shit there's gotta be something like
plague frogs really oh shit
I'm just button mashing at this point
that seems to be like however I'm doing
that move the grab the grab and hit her
up with my thing that seems to be
working pretty well not every fighting
game ever
I don't know now this is every fighting
game ever just the one sheet small
attack
Moses brings the pain
Moses is like 120 years old he's gonna
die so he's young
didn't biblically Moses living to
something like 500 oh sure you know it's
something absurd like that it was
insanely long lived it's been a while
it's been a while since I read the good
book my friend I'm countering a lot you
know I think that's doing this
Moses was 900 so this is young Moses yep
history history of the world reference
but God has given you the 15 crack ten I
love you he's a master after I'm done
with this round I'm gonna look up how to
play this game I'm pretty excited about
that
I just wanted to jump right in Adam Noah
and other early guys all live like 900
years
well not in reality in reality these are
all people that probably didn't exist
certainly certainly so in Adams case
there may have been a farmer somewhere
who built the boat during the flood a
local flood there could be some like
inspiration for the Noah story that just
got ridiculously exaggerated as that was
in the course of centuries I was gonna
say all you know who what you know who
else lived for a ridiculously long
amount of time is Bilbo Baggins yeah
yeah you know even he aged he was he was
the oldest of the hobbitses there may
have been a farmer who like save some of
his sheep by putting them in like a boat
that may have happened sure
like wing of the river fluttered a bit
gotta ruin his farm but he saved his
goats
Jesus rich do you stand up in the middle
of a crowded theater and yelled Darth
Vader isn't real we're playing this game
and this wasn't my choice and this is
what we're talking about I'm sorry
staff miracle 10 commandments down down
forward forward down forward down back
mighty uppercuts like the only time this
ever came up with family was when I got
forced into the confirmation right so
you know fuck you I'm sorry you're so
sensitive about your beliefs
when I started more of the chosen I just
finished Mario Plus rabbits which before
I move on I might play that a bit more I
might finish up all the things
challenges
I should change this it's easy
I'm glad that they gave what they gave
city jiggle physics come back to button
mashing
first mistake was not picking food well
listen look at Moses Lord Odin vs Zeus
Lugh epic epic battle for the ages
that's fine
I try I'm just gonna I'm gonna see if I
can like go out like with a training
dummy training here we go
like there's a whole training section
it's a let's be the Buddha Eric the Lord
says the first high school football game
was a lot like my first time having sex
I was bloody and soaring in but at least
my dad came
we're doing this now what
go to menu setup the second player
patroller be sure make sure it
recognizes the two
I don't see my family
from game bar
when I go to the games menus and see
go to the star since just emailed
factorio as a gift to you email highly
recommend factorial okay
top-down survival game what fun is
building a giant factory to automate the
shit that's usually tedious in survival
games
okay so this is light let's medium is
heavy and that's for all
okay
okay
fighting on grass well six weeks have
been a practice room yeah this is just a
if you see on the way left it shows me
all the buttons I'm president so I can
practice should the Buddha have a lot
more arms you think of Shiva Buddha only
had two
I would do this super super super move
is down towards down towards madam so
Stritch you could pick any god to be for
a day and could remember it and the
ultimate superpower grants the ability
so he won't let you be the almighty god
you'd have to pick the correct god who
you gots what
what's a correct gun
it's a code what is a crack guys yeah
something game audio too loud I can see
the bar relative dust is okay pause for
readjustment how do we feel about this
that should be fine so at any point will
be something that isn't this I do I have
a back-up plan
absolutely I thought we might be able to
get some comedy out of this well we have
to be able to play together
oh yeah well from learning how to play I
won't get I don't get to learn how to
play oh yeah you definitely won't figure
out the second controller then we could
learn together Jack I guess no I don't
want to know
don't want to open game bar you keep
making new
Dubey sandwich says this may be my last
tip and stream for the time being
giving hermas on my path gotta say you
guys picked a fitting game for the
situation thanks for the memories
hope I don't die but I may not you'll be
fine you'll be fine hey it works yeah oh
great
alright it works now well yeah yeah
Irma's coming man there will be a nubes
I'm gonna be Anubis erm is coming to
that's two hurricanes right in a row
their second boss form nature that's
Trey Zeus
random okay so light attack medium tech
heavy attack grab okay this is just like
your it's called like DPS I don't know
what that means and then it's like lock
not block block is just pressing away
from some okay this is like your shoot
button I think : I think if I nope or if
I press towards you and shoot nope
now did something with Buddha and then
you do you can press like down towards
in one of the attacks and that does a
special or towards down towards or okay
let's go and jump is just up
Anubis destroys you oh shit
shit Oh Zeus is more powerful than
Anubis oh you know we should we should
do an elimination tournament to see who
what you guys is the goal sir each God
and either side of them sure well you
know what we need we need a fair we need
a randomized bracket who get to buy the
first round you know that kind of stuff
what is one of the one of those someone
in chat want to make us a bracket we're
just just survivor like once Zeus is
dead yeah I have to pick a new character
once I lose the Zeus okay sure
he loses Anubis you have to pick a new
character to see who's the ultimate guy
we'll see who's the ultimate guy okay
cool whoever's left on the one side then
what we could we can we can pick amongst
them all right cool I like it
come up come here
rich you're a fighting game master how
do you do this special attacks with your
what special attacks where the screen
goes dark and I press something's about
to happen I press the trigger button
it's obviously not doing me much good
oh this game is so janky yeah I mean
this is listen oh sorry yeah this is
this is a lot of okay so now you guys we
did the top 2 so we did the Zeus in our
new booth so I guess you're the bottom
half on the top halfs I don't want to do
this sure sure alright alright so how
about Athena okay we'll see if Athena
can take you
Athena versus Zeus oh hey there you go
hey twice we're--aw don't worry we'll be
Jesus Jesus is in there I'm saving Jesus
for last this one was also like $3.50 so
that's what you get it's gotta be a way
to summon fucking lightning I'm soos
shit
really guess I need to be closer agree
to do that I don't even know how that
happened right Oh Zeus wins that's round
one it's round one
keep throwing my shield at you
stop it stop it
now Thunderbolts come here get him get
him
yeah what is Zeus unlike an old
Chinatown curio shop owner whoa oh come

got on the other side zip versus Odin
Korn wins
mega cordon mega corn attack isn't very
powerful
SIF wins is this now just tits vs.
Christ yeah banish him - that's the
thing it gave me the power of corn
alright here it is
Jesus its wheat not corn uh yeah it's
wheat
yeah listen it's funner to say corn yeah
basically it's more fun than anyone yeah
corn is a funnier word Jesus versus
Jesus that's what we got going here I
love that that makes the whole game
worth it right there
Oh suck it Jesus
mega-girl oh come on Oh
came to nothing Christ see in three days
you get it because I was gonna kill you
see you in three days
Ron corn oh come on
make me waste my mega moves
oh holy lights the power of Christ
compels you
Oh mega corn
you can't hit all his corn and y'all
crucified won't do the super move this
is it was hard to do
oh okay is that it was that it was that
your last character sip that means that
means uh this lady right here is the
best of all gods all right syphilis but
you're out of wheat is the best of all
gods well god bless that cleavage right
listen all right so what no no this is
this is um unless you want to play this
anymore can we unlock stuff I'm done
with this yeah I know that's about what
we can get out of this right hold on we
can there's biographies
the central figure Christianity he is
regarded by most Christians as the Son
of God who died for the sins of his
people and who is resurrected after his
crucifixion character type close-range
combatant Jesus's variety of moves and
buffs gives rise to multiple tactics
forcing opponents into corners by
unleashing Holy Light is often the great
first step DPS resolution this recovers
Jesus's HP and bestows Jesus with a
damage buff to increase damage dealt
however this will also increase the
damage received this buff does not
disappear after it has been launched so
try to avoid using it if you're under
attack that's great well now I could
find out who some of these people are
like whose Guan gong the Taoists God of
War Guan gong Guan gong was a general
serving under the warlord lai bill I
know Lee oh boo because he's in Dynasty
Warriors he was defeated as early as the
CFI he was deified as early as this you
dynasty and is still worshipped by many
Chinese people his deeds and moral
qualities have been lionized and he is
also respected as an epitome of loyalty
and righteousness great who the fuck is
SIF the goddess of the fertility of the
earth shit yeah girl SIF was born a
second-generation goddess of Asgard she
is the wife of the Thunder God Thor and
is well known for her blinding golden
hair
scholars have proposed that sifts hair
represents fields of golden wheat and
that she is associated with fertility
family and wedlock wait was Siffin was
sick the girl fighter and Thor I don't
recall I think so the goddess of the
bounds right so his festival was SIF in
any of the Thor movies
yes that is lady oh really
so the warrior in the Thor movies is
Lady SIF epitome is not what I said
epitome huh epitome and I said episode
week just because I was reading oh sure
you're right absolutely all right well
shit sorry guys
we kind of know who Athena is who be the
goddess of the Sun and the universe
Amaterasu Amaterasu in full Amaterasu
omikami is the celestial sun goddess
from whom japanese imperial families
claim descent and as an important to
Shinto deity Matsui is often portrayed
with a bow and armor as she's holding no
okay well there you go
well shit now we know wait who's a new
basic god of death god of lost souls in
the helpless Anubis is the Egyptian god
of mummification and the afterlife as
well as the patron god of lost souls
come on
well shit there we go there's uh can
someone give me an uptight what's our
uptime on this
Jack finally got it close to right sorry
yeah I'm terrible with names and reading
Hugh really should be in this game that
would be great if Q was a was a fighter
what do you do
what boat Q's moveset big right it's
teleport one hour a minute he can
obviously he could teleport right it
would just turn you into whatever
instead of like summoning a dog or a
snake maybe he'd like Picard would run
out and run at you yes it's absolutely
ridiculous
all right well I'm good with an hour of
that if that's what we can get out of it
that was that was worth the $3.50 I paid
for it
oh it's cheap okay next game yes he was
worthless unless you can get John de
Lancie
