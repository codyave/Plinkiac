Jack: Yay! We're dancing! You can't see it, but we're dancing!
Jessi: Now you have to play the other Friends Forever song.
Jack: Yay!
Jessi: Your other favorite Friends Forever song.
Jay: The Saved by the Bell one?
Jack: Oh, wait. Hold on. Only through the elimination of violence can we achieve world peace.
Jay: I need to rewatch Miami Connection. That movie is so great.
Jack: It really is.
Rich: Oh, we stopped the stream.
Jay: Bye, everybody. We're gonna go watch Miami Connection.
Jack: Enough with this video game bullshit. We're gonna watch bad movies again. Um, that song is super awesome.
Jay: It's great.
Jack: That song is just the greatest. Um, let's get, let's see here. And, by the way, uh, we got distracted and didn't decide what we were gonna play next. Let's play the mosquito game. Let's play, we're gonna play the mosquito game next.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: Because why the fuck not. Man, do I remember how to work...oh, well, that's okay. I'm gonna be okay with that, Rich. Friends for eternity, friendship, harmony.
Jay: You're ruining it.
Jack: Shut up.
Jay: You're getting all the lyrics wrong.
Jack: Well, when you've heard it twice...I can't remember. I don't know shit about shit. 
Jessi: Mosquito man.
Jack: What?
Jessi: ...with that family...
Jack: There we go. See you again soon! Oh, yay!
Jay: See you in hell!
Jack: See you in hell. Okay, and...okay. And...oh, I forgot about this. The, the super fancy PS2 turn-on screen, it's, like, the future! Rich, do I need to do anything with the controller to make it go? Oh. 
Jay: You have to remove skeleton.
Jack: Oh, I should have removed skel...I should--
Jay: Do you know where that originated from?
Jack: I think it's, it's just a Dark Souls meme.
Jay: Okay.
Jessi: Um, people want, well, not people, one person asks, Jack and Jay, shirts off for...
Jay: What, what makes them think we're not already?
Jessi: Yeah, they're, they, they...
Jack: Of course we weren't.
Jessi: They're not wearing shirts, guys, they're not wearing shirts.
Jack: So if you want, we could put our shirts back on, and then take them off? That, do you think that would help? Um, this is how we roll now.
Jay: When?
Jack: Playing, w're playing a game called Mister Mosquito. Would you like to sit and watch?
Jessi: Yeah. Would you like to sit by me? Oh, yeah. I would.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: Wait, we're not getting anything on the stream. Oh we didn't remove skeleton, guys.
Jay: That's great.
Jack: Yeah. I've just...
Jay: What'd you do?
Jack: Well, I broke it, obviously.
Jessi: Oh. Prayer to God by Shellac is my favorite.
Jack: Oh, that's good.
Jessi: That's a great song. I played that for Jack, um, here four years ago.
Jack: I'm sure you did.
Jessi: I have.
Jack: I'm sure you did. I'm sorry.
Jessi: There is no...
Jack: Hold on, guys. We're getting the settings, we're gonna get Mister Mosquito up here. Pause for skeletons, or another meme. I fixed it. 
Jay: What was the problem?
Jack: Oh, because, uh, I reset the PS2. My capture box got confused.
Jay: Oh.
Jack: And so it just stopped sending the video signal. It got, it got scared and confused. Jessi, can you...
Jay: Shit got weird?
Jessi: Oh, update?
Jack: ...uh, change that update? The game...
Jessi: Ooh.
Jack: Update, we're, so we're updating...oh, my god.
Jessi: I don't know what just happened. Okay, um...
Jack: Yeah, we've been through that. The gate is screwing up the audio. You either, you either get the noise gate, or you get a really awful hum. That's your choice. Oh. Oh, Rich is coming.
Jessi: How's that coming? Should I update?
Jack: Huh? Oh, no. Also, change the game.
Jessi: Oh.
Jack: Oh.
Jessi: Oh.
Jack: Well, so now, click in here.
Jessi: Um...
Jack: We're, we're figuring it out guys. Yeah...oh, it's Mis-, it's spelled out. It is.
Jessi: Oh. You're right.
Rich: Right in front...
Jessi: Uh, can't...
Rich: Right in front of your face.
Jessi: Guess what, I'm blind.
Jack: What?
Jessi: So, I mean...
Jack: Okay, wait now, click on that.
Jessi: Like that?
Jack: Yep. And now hit update. And, updated! Okay, now we're gonna play Mister Mosquito.
Rich: I don't remember anything about how to play this game.
Jack: Okay. All right, well that's fine. We're gonna do it, anyway. We're gonna play this game. The jams are gonna be jimmied. The, the joovies are gonna be jibbed. The...
Rich: The blood will be sucked.
Jack: Aughhh! Oooh.
Rich: Yeah, I believe you can change the color of your...
Jack: Oh, I do want to change, oh...
Rich: Oh...
Jack: No.
Rich: I got it saved somewhere, but...
Jack: Whatever. Okay, stage! Start! Yay, Mister Misquit-oooh!
Jessi: Misquit-oooh?
Jack: I tried to...misqui-doo!
Jessi: Misqui-doo.
Rich: Misqui-doo!
Jack: Misqui-doo! Oh, yeah, we might need to change the audio settings. No, oh, I see them blipping. They should be blipping for you guys. Frame rate is shitty, yo. That's true, yo. Nothing we can do about that.
Rich: ...hear it. I wish we could hear it. 
Jack: Not a perfect system, Rich.
Rich: I know, I know.
Jack: Streaming...streaming was built for one person, and we're trying to do it as a group. 
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: This looks like a great cutscene. I don't know.
Jessi: This is boring.
Jack: They're talking.
Rich: Talking about stuff, and things.
Jack: They're talking about jimmies, jams...
Rich: About life. Things they should be doing with their life.
Jack: That's true. Thank you, thank you, gooddocks. We should take pride in the fact that we are the only people streaming this right now. So if, if there, if anyone is looking to, to watch some gameplay footage, live gameplay footage of Mister Mosquito, they can only get it right here.
Rich: Oh, is that a Twitch thing? You can search for, like, a game.
Jack: Yeah. 
Rich: Well, that's neat.
Jack: Yeah. It is neat. I use that a lot, like, I like to watch, I really like to watch FTL runs.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: You know, just to get ideas.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Loading takes a long time. Ughhh....
Jessi: You all right? Boring...
Jack: Oh, so, uh, Jack, Jack is playing the game, I've never played Mister Mosquito before. I don't really know how to play...uh-oh. Uh-oh! Space! Oh, I want that poster, um, just a poster with people on it that says SPACE. Okay, so what's my mission?
Rich: Uh, you're gonna have to land on her and suck her blood. I don't remember how to do any of this because it's been, like, ten years since I've played this game.
Jack: Okay, suck two tanks of blood, and there is one EX Tank in here.
Rich: I don't remember what that does.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: I don't know a lot of things.
Jack: Whoa. That's it. Okay, so left...this is left, uh, stick.
Jack: Right. There's literally a button for gas. Okay, oh, okay. R...R1 is go forward.
Rich: R1, all right.
Jack: Oh, my god. How do you stop?
Rich: You can, oh, the lightswitch.
Jack: How do you stop going forward?
Rich: Try, try L1. Go down.
Jack: Ah! Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right. So, so it's, it's like a, it's like a racing game. R1 is go, L1 is stop. Wait, I want to find an EX tank.
Jessi: They're saying choppy.
Jack: Eh...whatever.
Jessi: Oh, okay.
Jack: It is. I can see, I can see we're dropping frames.
Jessi: Yeah.
Jack: But, we can do about that, internet might be weird over here. Whoaaaa. So, sorry y'all. If, oh, it is choppy, I see it in the preview. Not a whole lot we can do about that. That's, that's internet speed. It might be ours. Oh, you know why? Do you guys want to know why it's choppy? Because right now, uh, if you remember Jay said he was uploading something to YouTube.
Jay: It was that upload?
Jack: No, it's, it's choppy...as long as you can still hear us, I don't care if it's choppy.
Jay: It will be done very soon.
Jack: It will be done very soon, guys.
Jay: What you all need to do is stop watching the stream...
Jack: Uh-huh.
Jay: ...quit paying attention to us...
Jack: Uh-huh.
Jay: ...and go to YouTube. But it's not up yet.
Rich: Now, I know at some point, there's gonna be, like, a vulnerable spot on her that you have to land, but I think...
Jack: Sure.
Rich: ...I think you need the...
Jack: I'm looking for the EX Tank. I'm, I'm just learning how to fly around.
Rich: You're just exploring? Okay.
Jack: I'm exploring, Rich.
Rich: L2 button, rear view. R2 button, 180 degree turn.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: R1 button, accelerate. L1 button, burst.
Jack: Uh-huh.
Jessi: This looks boring.
Jack: Yeah.
Jessi: Bye.
Rich: Oh.
Jack: Ohh...yeah, I can see that.
Jessi: Goodbye.
Jack: Bye, Jessi.
Jessi: Bye.
Jay: This game looks stupid. What are you, some kind of fairy?
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: What are you, some sort of magical creature?
Jack: I'm a mosquites.
Jay: Oh, you're a mosquito. Oh, this is the mosquito game.
Jack: Hold on for a sec, hold on. Okay, now, sorry about that, guys. We're figuring stuff out. Okay. We come over here. Well, Rich can come over here. You can sit on...
Rich: All right, I'm over here.
Jack: Okay. Oh, oh god. You guys have no idea how...
Rich: Don't, don't go, Jessi?
Jack: Don't go, Jessi. Yeah. Jessi's got important stuff to do. Important stuff to do.
Jessi: Oh. Yes.
Jack: I've got what to do? We all want Jessi to stay. I bet there's an EX Tank here in the garbage. Huh?
Rich: You don't even know what it does, you just want it.
Jack: The game told me there was an EX Tank. And that means it's a, it's a hidden secret, right?
Rich: Okay.
Jack: Oh, look. I found it. I found it.
Rich: Okay. Where is it?
Jack: There.
Rich: Huh?
Jack: Oh, I just collected a heart ring. Collect 50 heart rings to increase max lives...by what? Oh, so that wasn't the EX Tank.
Rich: By what?
Jack: Okay, that was not the EX Tank. But that was, that was something. Okay, so it's telling me to go over here. Telling me to go over here. Okay, what do I do when I get here. Did I miss...
Rich: Try hitting the buttons.
Jack: Ah!
Rich: There you are.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: You stung it. You turned the switch off.
Jack: Okay. Aughh! Whoaa!! What is this game?
Rich: It's weird.
Jack: This is so weird, Rich. I don't know if I like it.
Rich: That's okay. I, I wanted to play it just because I know it's weird. You've been spotted, Jack.
Jack: Huh?
Rich: I said you've been spotted.
Jack: Eh?
Rich: By, apparently, she didn't pay you much mind.
Jack: Oh, good. Good, good. Okay. Okay. Nah, she doesn't...whoa! Oh, that's like a quick turn.
Rich: Oh, there you go. Wait. Go back to her. Go back to her.
Jack: Oh, no. But look, there's...
Rich: There's a thing on her.
Jack: Oh. Oh.
Rich: That's where you go and do your [indecipherable], Jack.
Jack: Oh, I don't like this! This is weird, Rich! This is weird!
Rich: I know it is. It's the only reason I wanted to play this.
Jack: Oh, this is weird. I have to, like, suck on her leg.
Rich: Uh-huh. Uh-oh.
Jack: What'd I do?
Rich: Uh, you did something wrong.
Jack: I, I don't know what button, what button stops flight?
Rich: Uh, here. Here. Uh, zero, uh, O-button, circle button. Attack, stabilize, take off...X-button, take off. I don't see a suck blood button.
Jack: Aughh!
Rich: Oh. R3.
Jack: R3?
Rich: Yep.
Jack: Why?
Rich: Right, R3, analog stick button. Flying movement, pierce skin, and suck blood.
Jack: Jesus Christ. Okay, we're gonna...thing we can do. This is weird. I feel weird. I do it? Augh, I did. Get outta here. I feel weird playing this.
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: I do. Absolute...You don't see shit. You don't see shit, lady! Get outta here. What is this?
Rich: I dunno.
Jack: Room thing?
Rich: Thermostat?
Jack: Nothing. You know, like, it would be different, the weird thing is that it's, like, a young girl.
Rich: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack: Where it's, like, if, if, if I was, like, just in the jungle and it, like, it was like a horse or something, it would be fine. I mean, it would still be weird, obviously. The fuck? How do I do this?
Rich: I don't know.
Jack: The fuck? How do I do this?
Rich: Aim, aim towards...and maybe push down the R3 button.
Jack: I did.
Rich: Oh, she, she moved. 
Jack: Oh, fuck her. All right. All right. Can I get in? No. I don't know about this, Rich.
Rich: We don't have to.
Jack: Well, no, I mean, I, this is, this is weird enough where I kind of want...oh, look, VHS's!
Rich: What do they say? Anything?
Jack: No. Press anything on the TV? Oh, there's a little thing. You just collected a heart. Yay! I got a thing, guys!
Rich: You're so insecure. This ain't a porn game.
Jack: I'm so insecure?
Rich: Yeah, that's what somebody said.
Jack: I mean, I don't know if it's an insecure thing, it's just weird. I feel, it makes me weird, it makes me feel weird playing this. I don't know if that's an insecure thing. That's just how I feel.
Rich: For what it's worth, you're terrible.
Jack: Thank you. That, that does make me feel better. Okay, now I gotta get outta here so she doesn't spot me, right? All right, I hide over here, I hide over here, and wait for the little girl to go back to bed. And that's why it's weird. Cuz I'm waiting for a little girl to go back to bed so I can jump on her leg. Bed, little girl. See, this is weird.
Rich: Jack, there's nothing weird about it. You're just going to violate her with your mouth.
Jack: Exactly! You shut up, Rich. Okay. Okay.
Rich: All right, go there slowly. Get close.
Jack: Uh-huh.
Rich: And then try the R3.
Jack: Okay. R3 doesn't do anything.
Rich: All right. All right.
Jack: Help me out here. Where do I have to...
Rich: There you go!
Jack: Now do what?
Rich: There's some kind of meter on the right.
Jack: Oh, okay.
Rich: Keep the, keep the thing in blue.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: What are you doing, rotating it?
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: Okay, and then your tank goes up.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: All right. All right. That's not that bad.
Jack: Okay. I need, I need two tanks.
Rich: Yeah. Yeah. Fly away at any time. That's when she gets agitated.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: You can take off.
Jack: Ooop! So close, gonna get it! Ah, get...
Rich: Oh!
Jack: Oh, no! Ohhh! What the fuck?! You play this.
Rich: All right, I'm gonna give this a shot.
Jack: You come over here. This game is weird, and I feel weird. Oh, sure.
Rich: All right. I'm gonna give this a shot.
Jack: Yeah, let Rich do this shit, horseshit.
Rich: ...while everybody stands in front of the TV.
Jay: Oh, oh!
Jack: I think that helps. Oh, my!
Rich: Oh, my god. This takes so long to load.
Jack: Yeah.
Rich: What's wrong with this?
Jack: Very long. 
Rich: Why is she turning her light on? Seems backwards.
Jack: Maybe she's worried about people violating her.
Rich: To Catch a Predator.
Jack: Ha. That's a...
Jay: What was that? I don't even know what you're talking about. I just walked into the room.
Jack: Kinda lame.
Rich: Well, you know, we're the first and only people to ever stream this, so it's got that going.
Jay: There's a reason for that.
Jack: Okay.
Rich: You can fly anywhere. I think that's neat.
Jack: I mean, like I said, it, this would be a much more...I would feel better about this game if, if I was...
Jay: Oh, my god.
Jack: ...if, if we were, like, in the jungle and, and hunting animals or what-not, right? Then it would feel less weird. But because you're going after an underage girl who's sleeping in bed in little shorts, it's weird. That's what makes it weird. Yeah, yeah, because of the weird things you guys are saying in chat, it makes me feel weirder.
Rich: What are they saying in the chat?
Jack: Suck that little girls inner thigh, Jack!
Jay: Oh...
Jack: Yeah. That's why it's weird.
Rich: All right. We can stop. We can stop.
Jack: Let's, let's at least go to the next, um, to the next stage.
Rich: Okay.
Jack: Just to...just to see what's jimmying all the jams. Just to give us a sense of...
Rich: I can't even manage the basic controls here, Jack.
Jack: You can't?
Rich: The, the, the actual sucking of blood is...
Jack: Yeah, yeah. Also, that is weird. You know, it's one of those, you have to rotate and stay in the blue line and you gotta jam a lot of jims. It happened. Yeah. You guys, did you guys stop saying stuff in the chat? 
Jay: Oh. Yeah. It's gone here, too. What happened?
Jack: I dunno.
Rich: What button did you press to...aughh, I did it, and then I...
Jay: Get rid of chat?
Jack: Huh?
Jay: By accident? Where did chat go?
Jack: I might, I guess I might have cleared chat. Sorry if I cleared the chat.
Jay: Somebody say something.
Rich: Maybe nobody is watching us, basically?
Jack: No, no, there's people.
Jay: Like, what...
Jack: Okay.
Jay: Where is everybody else?
Jack: I dunno.
Jay: Are we crossing the streams by having it on two...
Jack: Oh, maybe.
Jay: ...done that before.
Rich: I dunno.
Jay: Weird.
Jack: All right, hey guys, something is not stir in the Kool-Aid. We can't see any of your chat. What?
Jay: That showed up here.
Jack: That showed up there? That's weird.
Rich: What did you press to do the sucking?
Jack: R3.
Rich: No, I mean to, to control the...
Jack: Oh, R3, R3 is stick, you have to stick your, your nose in. There you go. Now you rotate.
Rich: Okay. Okay.
Jack: You got it.
Rich: Oh. Oh, I see what I do.
Jack: This is really weird, guys. No one's in the chat room, and I just don't believe that.
Jay: Someone, someone tweet at Previously Recorded if you can see the chat or not.
Jack: We can't see any of the chat.
Jay: There's nothing showing up in the chat.
Rich: Good way to tell.
Jack: Whoa, I got a lot of tweets. Hold on.
Jay: There's always a problem.
Jack: There's always a problem. Um, no one's tweeting at me yet. Yeah, Twitch chat is dead for some reason. Sorry, guys. I, I'm just getting your tweets now. Uh, I have no idea what is happening to the chat. But...so, like, we didn't turn chat off or anything. We're still chatting. 
Rich: All right.
Jack: Oh, did you do it?
Rich: Yeah.
Jack: Yay! Good job, Rich!
Jay: Broke.
Rich: Do we have to restart the stream?
Jack: Uh, no. It sounds like everyone's chat broke. Well, something's broken on Twitch, guys. Really sorry if, if you can't chat. I guess we'll just wait it out. We'll keep playing and what-not.
Rich: I wonder if other streams right now are having the same problem, or if it's local.
Jack: That's a good, if anyone else is watching any other streams, let us know at Previously Recorded, PreviouslyRec twit. Thank you guys for tweeting at me. Uh, yeah, I think, yes, I think you're right. Mister Mosquito killed the chat. Mister Mosquito is too much for Twitch to handle. I think you're absolutely right. Yeah. I'm getting, I'm getting the, the loading circle of death over here. And I can't see anyone except for me in chat. And no, I did not put it in mute mode or anything like that. In fact, it's not even loading up for me now. Internet things. You know. Oh, wait. Now we're getting it. Now we're getting it. Okay, chat's back.
Rich: Wasn't somebody just saying in that chat how long till the stream?
Jack: Of course they were. That's just what people...
Jay: It's working again.
Jack: Yep, chat's working again.
Jay: Okay. Trying to update the website right now, too.
Jack: Oh...
Jay: There's issues with that as well.
Jack: So there's an overall internet issue.
Jay: Everything is a problem, always.
Jack: Yes.
Rich: The entire internet has gone down.
Jack: Welcome back to the chat, everybody.
Rich: Al-Qaeda has made their move.
Jack: Hey! Chat's working now. So, do you think the problem was that you were, that you were doing some internet stuff?
Jay: No, no. I wasn't doing anything at the time when chat went out. And now, look. Here, I'm trying to get the embed code. Loading.
Jack: I mean, yeah, we're soaking up, we're soaking up a lot of your bandwidth.
Jay: No, it's doing that, well, I guess it wouldn't matter which computer. I don't think it's related.
Jack: I don't know. Hey...
Jay: This is a simple thing.
Jack: This is a simple thing. Welcome to...
Jay: But, what, what we'll say, though, for people listening to this, I'm trying to update the website, and Jack is fucking it up by streaming in our studio. It's all Jack's fault. You can blame him...
Jack: Yep.
Jay: For no new video.
Jack: Fuck...you...Baaaah-man.
Jay: No, that's not true. 
Jack: It, no, it's absolutely true. I, I ruined...
Jay: No, we had this from before, actually. I don't know what the deal is.
Jack: Eh.
Jay: Sometimes...
Jack: Yay, chat! 
Jay: Are they being jerks now because I was making fun of you?
Jack: No, not, oh, that, they probably are just hearing that now.
Jay: Oh, yeah.
Jack: Remember, there's a, there's a significant delay. Goddammit, Jack. I want my new Plinkett. Absolutely, guys. That's exactly what he's uploading.
Jay: I'm uploading the new Plinkett review!
Jack: Yep. Did we, did we say what it was earlier, the new Plinkett review, our made up movie?
Jay: Oh, you made up a movie for the Plinkett review?
Jack: Well, every week, cuz...
Jay: Oh, okay.
Jack: They ask when the new Plinkett review is every week, and I always say it's coming tomorrow.
Jay: Okay.
Jack: But I try to give them a new movie.
Jay: You don't wanna know that the real Plinkett review is the third season of Family Matters. You don't wanna give that away. Oh, oh! Shit! Cuz the third season is when that show really started to go downhill.
Jack: Absolutely.
Jay: You remember the first season, before Urkel was even a character on that show? He wasn't originally a part of that show.
Jack: Really?
Jay: Yeah.
Rich: I hate Urkel so much.
Jay: Everybody hates Urkel.
Jack: No, I, I have no recollection of that show before Urkel.
Jay: It was originally just a show about that family, and Urkel was on one episode...
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: ...as just a one-off thing. And they're like, oh, finally something about the show that people like.
Jack: Yeah.
Jay: So they just ran that shit into the ground.
Jack: Absolutely. I remember Stefan Urquelle.
Jay: Oh, I wasn't watching by that point. I'm aware of it.
Jack: When Steve Urkel--
Jay: Not that I watched a lot to begin with, but, I know, like, like, wasn't there, like, time travel at one point, and he had, like, multiple characters that he played, and all this...
Jack: Well, the, the thing was, Jaleel White was turning into a handsome, handsome man.
Jay: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Jack: And so they had him use his magic science power to turn himself into attractive person, Stefan Urquelle, who...
Jay: I think he played a girl, too, sometimes.
Jack: Sure.
Jay: Urkel's cousin, or something, this lady...
Jack: Was there, like, a cloning machine, maybe?
Jay: I don't know. Nobody was watching it at that point.
Jack: Oh, no. And I'm sure, just, the writers at one point, it was like, let's see what we can get away with.
Jay: No one's watching. Let's do new things.
Jack: No one's watching.
Rich: All right. So do you wanna give this one a shot, or do you wanna do something else?
Jack: Did you beat the level?
Rich: Yeah, I already beat the second stage.
Jack: Oh, you beat the second stage already?
Rich: I've got this, I've got this down!
Jack: I wasn't watching.
Rich: I know you weren't. You were talking about Steve Urkel.
Jay: You know enough to know his first name.
Rich: That was, yeah, I know.
Jay: There was talking Urkel dolls...
