stars got our Stiltskin okay
oh all right here put that back put that
back that okay this whole area on your
right the brown background area yeah
that's your actual desktop okay this is
on the left that's assumed out version
there's things you can play around with
that I pull that out like click on that
pull it up
that's your rule book move that over to
your desk oh you can flip through the
pages basic rules
it starts off pretty easy I trimmed his
how to make sure everybody's got a
passport and you got to make sure it go
back Oh
make sure they are a are stowed skin the
citizen okay that's it our only our sole
skins with a passport can come through
and we are where are we first goes our
store scale arstotzka okay cuz you're
fucking country man fucking I'm loving
I'm wondering then you get you can flip
through the pages or multiple pages
screen keeps flickering by the way on
the stream looks fine from here well now
it's not but everyone's all starts
flickering see if it don't cut again
that's weird
there are other things on here doing
enough where it's annoying but I was not
doing it so I don't know well nobler
goes there look at that you see it yeah
I don't know what that is is the correct
thing to say
see like like you have to be like
specific with the pins some of these
aren't gonna come into play until later
days but like you have to make sure they
have like the official stamp from the
country they're from you have to check
the issuing cities oh my it's like it's
like if the are stowed skin it has like
a city for the the grit skin it's it's
the say you know it's forgery and you
can't let those people through okay so
I'm looking for these passports green
with the eagle yeah that's the only
people that can come through today okay
with a passport great
what is this and uh oh I that book this
book get the habit of keeping that on
your desk because later on you're gonna
need to go back to check with that just
to verify information okay Mayers here's
here's how this game works you make more
money what is this - that is a brand on
your desk if you want to does bring up a
desk audio transcript so somebody says
something you can go verify what they
say okay um you make money by letting
more people through or or denying them
properly okay um so it behooves you to
let as many people through as possible
to get money to actually feed your
family okay but then also if you want to
check them properly it takes time so you
kind of gotta balance doing a half-ass
job with making sure people with
forgeries don't get through I like it
okay okay
Green Eagle has a name pay attention to
nationality which has to be our stoltski
arstotzka that's gonna be tough okay
that goes here you think they want stuff
oh boy
yeah I don't think you're gonna have
much of use for the book on this day but
in general open it up open it up doing
it clean I'm not clicking the Hornet
believed anymore flickering uh no okay
notice I am alright see what they got
okay Irish drawers got we have to stab
them through right this stamp thing that
came up here's the thing and it says
Astros guy oh it doesn't have to be
aligned perfectly right I was doing it
again fuck him Joe know what that is
keeper okay hold on can I pause it yep
just it
main menu what's wrong
we're in flickering it's I wonder if
it's a resolution issue so I'll just go
down to not full screen that shouldn't
mess with you guys at all you should be
able to still yeah okay great
well you don't want that big green thing
so just make it a bigger screen area
because big as you can
well no no that's no that fucks with it
yeah I saw it you'll see in a second
you're gonna you're going to watch the
screen a lot of nobody can see the game
being played right this is looking that
bad it's pretty annoying
yeah it splits when I see it over on my
screen - I have no idea why as the is
the real there's no uh there's no
graphics option I got it oh yeah oh yeah
they're all this is that I hold on quick
and X starting over
I got a graphics option when I first
opened it I will I will redo that oh my
god also broke the computer a little bit
it's all Jays fault you're absolutely
all my fault
oh okay and everything's broken
Oh favors babysit stopped working yes on
the play papers please
yeah am i this is insane this this looks
like fun
okay it's not but it's fascinating all
the same that's sounds boring it's
genius that they managed to make a game
about checking paperwork see that sounds
funny in theory but I can imagine
actually playing it works it's strangely
works all right I will have to take your
word for it because I'm never playing it
I think you're gonna watch this game and
you're gonna see these neat things
happen but oh that sounds neat okay see
what happens
like when you have the guards drag
somebody away it's great yeah yeah oh
you can be a douche bag too like you can
you if you want to let somebody through
even though they vent like a forgery huh
if they seem like a sympathetic person
you can let them through anyway but you
lose money Oh like people will come to
you with sob stories good that's great
refresh okay other other people will
offer you bribes
we're getting there Oh
you guys can't see it yet Oh No
everything is broken of course papers

I mean the mother of my child which
killed herself

off the rope that's a motherfucking
video game yeah that one's actually
funny all right hold on we're closing
down papers please

what are you playing it through is it
just its own viola it's well I get a
couple options when I click the play
button I it says play papers please
launch windowed or launch software
rendering so I just tried software
rendering and the first time it was just
playing papers plays so now we're going
to try and launch windowed to see if we
can get rid of this flickering
fresh okay you guys
the other thing is you guys are not
seeing it this is the other problem
that's happening so we want to make sure

remember whether or not they'd have to
detain them to get the money I don't
okay
it's been a while since I played this
now and no I have never played Starcraft
I absolutely hate 99% of all realtime
strategy games because they're just
hectic and I don't get much out of it I
like strategy game where you can sit
down and plan your next move casually
not where you're just frantically
clicking on things and it's horribly
stressful
I hate fine games people like that it's
just that for me
DJing dates of birth don't match get the
fuck out of here look at the cold boot I
did okay watch somebody something okay
well yeah they're just catching up
oh it's this guy I am back again best
Sylvester Stallone movie we do we do
mean best as far as genuinely good movie
or best as far as dumb Stallone movie
that's
retaining that so I'm like I'm a casual
gamer because I don't like real-time
strategy games okay fine whatever you
like what you like I like really sorry I
don't like you like I damn what you like
I didn't say nobody should ever play
real-time strategy I just said it's not
for me by saying you didn't you don't
like it that is what you're saying no
rich I guess just like nobody should
like boyhood because we didn't like
boyhood and that clearly were implying
that nobody should best Frank Stallone
movie well that's easy
I'm Terabithia Beverly Hills no contest
I wish there was a better version of
Terra Beverly Hills out there water
sounds right most entertaining Stallone
movie hmm
ah mr. Stallone or Frank Stella
Sylvester Stallone um I don't know
spending a lot of time he's been in a
shitload of movies none of the
Expendables movies I can tell you that
cuz that's gonna be suck one of the
Rambo's I like everything like Cobra
that movie is so stupid and it is every
single 80s action movie cliche jammed
into it I haven't I haven't seen that in
so long Cobra it's it's entertaining I
watched another sort of incorporation
for the screen junkies thing I did about
eighties action movies and yeah it's got
the best depth of the main villain of
any of those movies the only thing I
remember about Cobra is that it was
almost sort of Beverly Hills Cop right
he was attached to Beverly Hills Cop but
he would make it darker oh yeah and that
that movie that he wanted to make and
dobro
I've been item okay is already just a
classic car in the movie and his license
plate is something like I'm awesome
something so stupid sounds great
good guy Jack good guy
I think they approve of your denying him
good somebody else those screaming let
him in let him in haha uh your expired
your expired dog sorry
tonight Oh over the top I mean I've seen
that well I did get a citation for
improperly denying someone yeah yeah but
you know the right thing that it isn't
that a great little thing it is that
this game can produce him on emotion
that I know I would go with rocky as far
as best real movies Rocky's looking
great it was a great movie but if we're
going with just entertaining like dumb
entertaining Stallone movie damn I would
say Cobra no Rocky's a great movie first
blood is a great movie and I like Rocky
Balboa ever called Rambo to being
entertaining I have it's entertaining
but it's so stupid it's like spits in
the face of everything that first blood
was about oh yeah but we know that yeah
yeah you just watch it is on its own
terms it's it's a fine dumb action movie
I uh I've heard the last one was kill
and I haven't seen it the last one is so
violent it's amazing really yeah it's
really gory is it is it but is it
schlock like the second one or is it
more like first blood it's kind of a
combination of both it seems to think
that it's some sort of more intelligent
movie about like real-world problems but
the gore is so great
and crazy so it kind of it kept is a mix
of the two come on what happened Jack
there's another terrorist attack that
ruined your mojo someone I let in
detonated a bomb the sudden went in or
someone just walking by I think it was
someone I let in
oh but anyway you be cleared see look
no he killed the gunner he killed the
guards but you know what I made $50 and
now my family's okay so no doesn't
matter to me I'm not your problem
anymore no dancers at Graceland Club
found dead no I stopped him from coming
in you have to get him arrested oh is
that what I have to do think yeah
you click on the the detained button and
then you click on the note she gave you
Oh whoopsie then you get him arrested so
you did the right thing but you kind of
fucked up I could I fucked up yeah
somebody fucked up
if I weren't reading the chat gal WRO
how you perhaps your name the Dolph
Lundgren movie you're thinking of is I
come in peace also known as Dark Angel I
don't know why it has two titles that
one's got two titles the blu-ray release
is called Dark Angel which is I guess
its original title or something but not
it's also called I come in peace I
haven't seen that since it was on cable
but I have to see of his because I I
liked it when I was young yeah Masters
of the Universe we got it out there I
know I know
very bad I liked it when I was young
going everyone says it's terrible
so well it's the classic 80s like we're
trying to save on money we don't have a
budget so they just go to earth they
just go to Babbo here's my question then
is it genuinely bad or people just
pissed off they're not in Eternia they
didn't have the budget for that often I
haven't seen in a long time but I want
to say it's bad okay I want to say it's
actually
but I don't remember it ever watch it
but all colored jeans must be searched a
new rule for the day
ah fuck you uh it was a cult Ian who
blew up the guards oh now she might
block the guards is she from culture
maybe I don't know you've lost all hope
for life because there's someone blew
him up I don't know what to say I say go
to jail is a communist country then I go
in the jail they're going to the gulag
yeah well should have got your numbers

the way
Nico and Kyo okay no don't ever hire me

someone to make like dick and fart jokes
at family gatherings I am your guy but
only family very well are just whenever

thoughts on mr. Mar snacks I know it was
I uh oh god I even I don't know if I've
seen it since the theater I liked it I'd
already join I liked it too ice consumed
like a bomb something I thought yeah I
don't think it did very well but I
remember being weird and funny I mean I
I have a dark sense of humor so I
appreciate it but yeah lots of people
get killed a bedroom yeah I I have to
re-watch it I'm kind of curious to watch
it actually cuz yeah I don't think I've
seen since if theater
I've seen someone recently it's not my
favorite movie ever but I like it yeah
yeah and might be the last decent Tim
Burton movie that's good pressure on the
mountain I think before that bad wood
which is a great movie
I found gender fuck she looked like a
lady look at the a sports a male I don't
know what a sport - at Mill you got to

month oh it's really great
they're good razors to harrys.com tell
Jackson you nothing will happen I'm
doing a coupon code Jack enter the
coupon code fuck what what are your
thoughts about Robin Williams death well
we're fucking pleased what do you think
our thoughts are yeah it's sad actually
we shot our Ninja Turtle episode
immediately after finding out that he
had died yeah I was kind of weird I was
back there setting up lights and rich
Kevin he said hey Robin Williams died
yeah hey just say I didn't seem quite so
on me hell no I know you didn't but hey
Jay yes then what that's what happened
no it was sad
yeah you know he's done so many
different types of projects like I know
some people don't like him because he's
too manic but that's not everything he
did I mean he's done so many different
things it's not my favorite comedian
stand up like George Carlin or Richard
Pryor no I like more stuff like Richard
but as his movies were quick okay well
some of them coming up yeah okay
world's greatest dad is one of my
favorite comedies of like the last ten
years I actually watched that that night
the night have you can check neither
both on the desk which is maybe a little
more of it because in that movie is
Sutton dies of auto-erotic asphyxiation
but it's a really good movie and he's
really great in it if you don't think
the fingerprints match I didn't really
get a good loan I know I can do the
describe but it came
his name came up okay okay so the
fingerprints - you gotta look at to you
yeah Jesus Christ I'm just a clerk I'm
sorry sorry
that's right now is that it was it was a
super shame like he's never gonna like
what fingerprints not matched her Oh oh
my god I think you guys my family's
dying and I just want to talk about
Robin Williams I'm probably alone in
this one of my favorite movies of his
pop I go really
I love Popeye I haven't seen that since
I was little yeah I just been too long
since I've seen that I just know it blew
my mind when I found out that movie is
directed by Robert Altman what it's a
great pump my movie I think it's not
Netflix right now I'd have to re-watch
it I haven't seen it since I was really
really little that way I think that
might be his first movie but over here
mark it's been a while I think so too
it's been a while since I've seen it but
I've seen it as an adult that I still
liked it I know how do i how do I do a
body scan give me I did give you the
option to know it if you need to it'll
come up yet you're gonna have to do the
discrepancy thing
Richard's confirmed for a horrible taste
Oh but does he like Popeye whatever I am
what I am
oh there you go there you go the Fisher
King the Fisher Kings a great movie yeah
yeah there's lots around William stuff
on Netflix right now the Fisher King is
a great movie but I like Popeye more
that's you can like Popeye bladder I'm
more real weird but you can like it that
that you know things things contour and
is there a rule for the weapon or
contraband in the book that's what you
would click on oh my god you have to do
that
oh my god fuck oh yeah and related to
what we're doing now I found out Robin
Williams as a big video was a big video
game fan yeah his daughter was named
Zelda Azam did you some of them have you
never seen those ads no there's ads
where they talk about it
really sentimental ads yeah they're
really tough to watch the big plays over
together
oh I named my daughter Zelda really yeah
I didn't know I thought that was
interesting
yeah World of Warcraft is apparently
trying to do something really big with
him with his likeness or something
because yeah he was big in the games
community and just you know like the the
hardest part was reading just about like
other comedians like writing about their
depression and how it affects them every
day you'd it was a really tough
oh wait wait no no no no no no no no I
see that you have a hang of it Jack your
name was changed from aleena to a Lina
fuck now no I'm denying your ass I'm not
arresting you how do you know if they
match her you try the discrepancy and
see if it notices anything click on one
of them a arms
matching data okay great
okay well sure fine whatever come on in
I wait wait stop go to the go that blue
paper again no known aliases Oh gotcha
so so Jack are you talking about the
cracked article from a few days ago the
cracked article was a really great read
also for I want to say salon.com
who's the guy that talked about you guys
on the radio
do you remember um Jim Norton Jim Norton
wrote a really great article too for an
online thing well just about just about
depression and how that can lead to
people being comedians and entertainers
it's it's very true and and yeah very
very sad what oh you don't have you
don't fuck basic rules all foreigners ah
come on come on foreigners must have a
thing and there's another thing here Deb
or is your into Kermit here fucking the
dead jerk wasting your time
well it's the days over anyway so I can
just take my time now emigrant forever
and did here to say that I'm immigrating
okay great
now you may as well be extra thorough do
you guys consider yourselves comedians
which is a good question I don't know I
don't know not really
we're just on site yeah we just make
goofy things I do we enjoy visitors also
you consider yourself I consider me a
comedian okay first of all I did comedy
for a long time I make guy works for a
comedy website I try to make jokes I
don't think I know I think I make we
make comedy videos
I enjoy comedy I enjoy making people
laugh but I'm not
that's enough qualified you know the the
question is is your intense to amuse
people like you know it is but my intent
was never to be in front of the camera
I'm in front of the camera out of
necessity
you know it's like my goal is not to be
but even even before you're in front of
the camera like you you know just
thinking of something like pork pork in
space whereas AG that's it's a dark
comedy but that's a comedy piece sure
would you would you call the Farley
brothers comedians sure absolutely
you I just call them cut comedy
directors well you know they're not
stand-up comedians but they are they're
comedians hey yeah I guess it depends
what we consider comedian I don't know I
know I lost my eye I just consider
myself a guy that makes stuff shit
you're an entertainer sure who works
primarily you know if I'm comfortable
calling myself an entertainer
ah that's the guy that makes stuff well
I I consider myself a comedian first our
proper definition is we read letter B
we're ready jack Jacqueline look wear
whatever you think we are look at your
family cold hungry my son is cold see
bacon hungry cold hungry hungry
I lost bacon cups negative 5 I lost 10
points in penalties because I let
assholes through fucking sleep try oh my
god
what do I lose your family will be sent
back to their village Oh No you are
under arrest until your debts are repaid
that's great oh that is great oh I've
never done that it ah and so I lost yeah
that's a great game yes that is a great
game it is ah fuck that that's great
that's really funny let's take a break
and figure out we're gonna do next oh I
do I do I do
um yeah hey guys we're gonna take a
little break that was a really fun run
on favors please down ha ha oh yeah you
didn't get in to the rebels no there's
no there'll be somebody who likes slip
you a piece of paper yeah and there's
like a like a secret code on it I mean
this there's a whole thing that happens
you didn't even get to ha ha ha ha
that's great they offer you a lot of
money to let their people in oh sure
yeah sure
oh man oh that's right we have resumes
oh yeah that's right you want to take a
break and work through those I'll play
the next game and you can read resumes
ok sure that's a good idea so here's the
thing we're going to take like a couple
minute break and then and then we'll
read some resumes so hang out y'all
