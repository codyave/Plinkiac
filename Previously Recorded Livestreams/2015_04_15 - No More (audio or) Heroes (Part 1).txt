my voice is too low because this mic is
piece of shit
and there's nothing I can do about that
well what the fucks are always louder
than me
I can't turn the mic up the mic is all
the way up the mic has turned up to 11
the mic has turned up to 11 and it
refuses to get any louder it refuses to
get any louder at all
alright I'm flying no more heroes and
I'm gonna be you don't want this rich
solo stream so I'm gonna be pretty quiet
anyway for a while so it is what it is
we'll talk about the terrible mic once
oh wait no I don't want a New Game+ I
want a new game and that's that's
obviously the new the the light saver he
has wanna skip past all this
and try to tell it to start a new game
from scratch for crying out loud
nothing is going right
yeah I don't want a New Game+ I just
want to do fresh game okay
okay don't worry girls can we can we do
that
what do I think of BuzzFeed using the
dicta birthday boy feature I had a pic
picture I don't even know BuzzFeed was
doing that as far as the no death status
of this run if it happens great but if I
die I'm gonna keep playing so that's the
plan I'm gonna try to not die but I
might and if I do well just fuck it
the gig assassinate the drifter so I
went where I was supposed to and waited
for the guy to show up and there he was
this cat well-dressed cool couldn't tell
if he was the shit or just plain aim
Sylvia Kristel an agent with his watch
my college association how about getting
readers the 10 killers above you and aim
for the top it's gonna be a long
what do you say bro join me let's see
how far we can take this
fuckhead
yo help me out here where's this
death-metal dude bad answer it's game
time alright so now I turn the game down
again we'll get there we'll get there
what I here's the thing here's the thing
here's the funny thing I did some checks
before this I did like a test recording
everything sounded fine I was a little
bit quiet but not unreasonably so and
the game volume was perfect relative to
me now I got it now we got the game
volume halfway before we're above and
where I change to the first time between
the too loud and the too quiet
hopefully it's good now I stopped it you
know what I'm gonna assume anybody
asking me to turn up the microphone now
is is just being a jerk I can't turn the
mic up for people who are just coming in
I cannot turn my mic up I might just end
this damn stream I might just end this
damn stream and go get my mic that I
need to wrap the towel around my head
for that's the only other option I can
think of doing should I do that
should I do that I don't know what else
to do
all right Mike is fine how's the game
audio now is the game audio okay I found
the sweet spot for the game audio I
would leave you but I would be coming
back after I get the old broken mic that
works better game audio is fine all
right I'm gonna I'm gonna continue as if
everything is fine my own headphones I'm
going through this game because my
headphones it's okay
as far as why I'm playing on my oldest
because I'm starting a new game from
scratch
turn the line down on the TV just a
chance the TV fast-paced action games no
down by fucking bullshit sound issues
see my last mic the one that you wanted
physically broke your earphone broke up
right
that was awesome a totally different
model of Turkish but it was a turtle
beach
people think I hate everything there are
things I like this and all of the music
contained within our sum
I think I think I could turn subtitles
on yeah just to make sure you can hear
it I'm turning the we load speaker off
that should come through the rest of the
rest of the audio jack will be here at
8:30 he has children
and that sounds like like a terrible
thing having children sounds awful
sounds like I've ruined your life it's
like it's like a stranger straitjacket
that you have to wear for 18 years
two straight jackets they require
constant attention
after I get the cherries
I always end up getting the power-ups
when three of a kind you get a different
color long-range energy blasts the
cherry speed-up time
where's the balance
I'm going I'm going to attempt to make
this ain't no death run but no
guarantees that's gonna happen and if I
die
for every triple7 you get don't use but
if I were to hit the minus key
usually you don't get this video
that'll be here around 8:30
that's the guy I gotta fight painting on
the wall
it's gonna shake hayloft you're gonna
have a painting of yourself made you may
as well work why not why not
suggest
yeah
it's stylish death
it's not always
ah goddamn it No More Heroes is there's
there's a version of it available on the
PlayStation 3
it's called No More Heroes paradise I
don't like the controls as much for the
regular controller I think this game
controls really good with um what the
Wemo I hate the way they make you do the
finishing moves
so that is that is Silvia she she runs
the the assassins association that does
the assassin this rankings she's the
girl you stumbled upon in the opening
cutscene of this game
you get to every boss and they do they
do give you a new wrestling move in the
I mean it's kind of silly because you
don't it's somewhat random I think I
think where you're standing when you do
a wrestling move might affect which one
you use the person you're doing it on
but it's kind of and you save them see I
have beaten I have beaten bitter CBB
rank clear not be ranked be difficulty
you know that means go fuck yourself
it's fine
five years ago a six 2007
quite beautiful wouldn't you say paid
for with the lives of many when you have
the strength to take life for yourself
that is true I am free of desire so long
as I have this scenery to look upon I
need nothing more please leave me you're
the one leaving in a body bag I'll only
say this once more leave yeah no huh me
leave you obviously don't know me you
don't get it do
hey you know what paradise is right
paradise this is paradise the place
where dreams are fulfilled well you've
had your dream old man time to wake up
this is no paradise all right then what
is it huh I'm glad you and I are on the
same page here
so no you have no idea do you
what a pity
arrogant crude little shits like you
come around from time to time listen
well the wall is high you can take that
to your grave okay my turds are green I
am not skipping any cutscenes in this
masterpiece
son of a bitch
you're joking right I don't care about
titles or power I just want to be number
one then most of the ways of the
assassin here's your ticket to paradise
right now about Frank be I'm damage
taken that's nice but clear time isn't a
I'm happy with that
all right to answer a question I saw in
the chat earlier no there there are no
stop-motion segments and space cops
whoever told you there's a hidden Darth
Vader in a stop-motion segment and space
cop they're just like they're just nice
kill Travis I didn't think you had it in
you it was rather exciting
congratulations you are now ranked tenth
how about some cash that should help you
busy bills I'm not feeling the sense of
accomplishment that I should so I just
got to do this a few more times right
yes and you will keep your promise the
Association cannot do and if I refuse as
the 10th ranked assassin you are now a
target for those who want to replace you
anytime anywhere
number 11 could be right around the
corner ready to put a knife
so what you're telling me is that I got
to continue fighting there's no way out
of this you set me up bitch quit your
bitching and get with the program
there's only one road out of here No
okay how about this if I become number
one will you do it with me
hmm maybe come on just once there we
have our character motivation
Travis Travis is going to kill the
world's top ten ranked assassins because
he might get laid it's great and it's
character motivation Jack would love it
Travis isn't stupid person and the
chalices have stupid he's just kind of
oblivious he doesn't care about anything
but himself and that that comes off as
being stupid it's just it's just extreme
self-centeredness I think Jack does hate
this game I was making a character
motivation joke it's a fart it's a far
escape thing with him am i ready anytime
gotcha
so those different things you can do in
the apartment there's clothes just like
ton of clothes you can buy in this game
I'm just I'm going to avoid a lot of
that just for for time sake I'm not
gonna grind for money to buy new clothes
I might I might buy one or two of the
jackets I like but I'm gonna I'm gonna
keep it pretty simple I only got one
difference my pair of sunglasses I can
wear the first game they're all
basically just Rhys kins on the same
clothes models
I think they figured if they gave Travis
a head he would be slightly slightly
less unlikable
the next fight has been arranged you
don't have a lot of time so I'll just
tell you what you need to know the ninth
ranked assassin is currently dr. peace a
doctor actually a detective a dirty and
unscrupulous detective with plenty of
dark secrets about him illegal
investigations illicit sales black
marketing he is your one-stop-shop for
marketing illegal goods in on top of
that he is a trained assassin he's been
doing some work for the Mafia and before
you know it he's up there ranked ninth
on the list to be frank he's good you
won't stand a chance against him you're
as good as dead what's it going to be
cowboy put me in coach $150,000 what a
hundred and fifty thousand lbs your
entry fee my overhead costs don't tell
me that you were not expecting so many
zeros on that price oh is that I am
ripping you off or some shit we have an
elite staff in the thousands personally
I think it's a bargain okay I got you
but you really think I got that kind of
dough on me what the hell am I supposed
to do you are supposed to do your job
you've been hired to kill someone so
just do it in quit your whining Plus on
the job training would be good for you
if you're interested I can introduce you
to an agent an advertisement agency but
really they're erasers I'll tell you
later I'm running late for my facial
catch up later okay
no yes yes Chad she is a gold digger and
that's that's why I love Sylvia she's
she's a great character she's a great
foil for Travis I know some people don't
like her I think she's great
this is uh robin atkin downes as the
voice and this this were all kind of
redeems him from having almost ruined
the Prince of Persia series though that
was more of the scripts fault than his
just playing the character they they
gave her they the the writers ruined the
prince and he was just he just had
happened to be the voice drain Warrior
Within
get on the bike get this on the road
just get this game moving
it's a bad day
what is my favorite boss fight in this
entire series
if you are like destroy man is great one
of my favorites is kind of a spoiler so
I'm not gonna talk about that
Alice and Margaret in two are some great
fights need to get a job to go on the
next mission there's a Wii game
lay that stop that was perfect
absolutely perfect
all right people come into the lake
there's nothing I can do about the sound
I think this this new microphone that we
picked up it's just terrible I have
everything on my everything is already
cranked all the way up the sound is what
it is that the old
this game does not have spikes you're
not enjoying this game I'm very sorry
this game is borderline experimental
that's that's what's great about this
game
so what's what's his deal of me putting
together a desk to deject tweet that I
was putting together the
TV stand
I put together a new TV stand for the TV
that we're playing the Sun one fight I
put together fringe before I kind of I I
enjoy an action
what kind of what is it you've seen
modern furniture it's fake wood it's
it's wood chips and glue just like
everything you buy at the store
killed some other guys too so I'm gonna
get a slightly lower score than I'd like
do that one other mission it's off to
dr. peace
what is my favorite beam saber and know
we're heroes one I kind of like the
blood berry I don't know the blood berry
actually no no the second one you get
the Tsubaki DeMarco cuz that one mixes
in some melee attacks with the with the
normal strikes and you get a lot of
wrestling kills that way which is which
is kind of fun
visually I like when you start with the
let's jacket her
the next mission
hey Travis the next file or a giant
destroyed stadium that the piece is
waiting for you hop to it
about that parking job how about that
that was great
everybody
jack-jack hello rich what's up can you
hear me I can hear you I don't know if
they're gonna hear you we've had audio
issues I don't know new mic is just
terrible but no I'm serious
I got everything cranked all the way up
people telling me I'm an extremely quiet
too quiet you are you are pretty quiet
did you did you turn it up on the handle
of the you know like on the wire yep
that's weird did you turn it up in your
