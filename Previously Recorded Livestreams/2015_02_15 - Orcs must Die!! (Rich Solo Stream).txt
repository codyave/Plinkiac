I'll say different things I really don't
give a shit my clock says it is 559 that
is the time I'm going by so so second
second I'm here at all we normally we
started these things at 8:30 I'm
starting at 6:00 and everybody is
complaining that is so sad
so absolutely sad okay I'm game I am
playing today would be works must die
why thought I had that up already on the
screen I did not start the game game is
starting this game is happy start rated
t blood gore and violence that's good
that's good
knows everybody's digging
and when doing fine there's everything
sound fine I assume everything sounds
fine this is a game volume like relative
to mine is that good
oh I'm not I'm not I'm not sad chat I'm
just I'm just cold
I just walked to the local gas station
to get something to drink and it is cold
out and this godforsaken city there's
God forsaken part of the world all right
we're gonna all right most people are
saying good so good good all right we're
gonna we're gonna slay some fucking orcs
this is the game and here is game I have
played to this game before but I am
starting on a new profile we're gonna go
through the game from scratch okay and
I'm not sick I'm just sniffling because
it's fucking cold outside okay here are
my goals for the game I'm going to play
on the the normal difficulty the warm
aged difficulty because you know easy
normal and hard they can't just do that
that's to starting from scratch my goal
is to get through the game not gonna
guarantee it at all but the attempt I
want to do five skulls on every map
which is kind of a perfect perfect score
I'm not gonna happen probably not gonna
happen not near the end but that's my
goal
barring that and I want to not die once
and not let any works past me I might I
might I might do bad on time but at the
very least I don't want to let any of
them damn orcs through I'm gonna click
on the Go button to start the game
oh my god I didn't press the key to
continue
I've spent 300 years fighting for the
order
I've killed thousands of orcs and
defended dozens of rifts and this is how
it ends one slip and a kobolds blood and
my skull cracks open on the gatehouse
steps so now the task of defending this
fortress falls to my apprentice that's
it then the world is doomed it's all up
to me now
rest well crazy old man first things
first let's see what he left me in this
spell book okay chap I am disappointed
it you know and not everyone in the chat
of course but some of you you damn well
know I do not skip cutscenes when when
it comes to games
I am the anti Jack uh here's how the
game works
you hold on I gotta I gotta invert my
why is the game to lob the game sounds
fine
assuming the game sounds fun
I didn't hit except girly
yes invert the fucking why I didn't
click on it three times because I didn't
want to do that oh my god alright so
here's this you're in this little this
little fantasy fortress area right and
this is a big glowing thing that is a a
dimensional rift that that leads to the
human world which I'm not sure whether
or not that's supposed to be earth in
this fantasy setting but that that leads
to human world this door outside of the
rift
what's pounding on that door are
thousands of angry orcs and they're
gonna break this door down and they're
gonna try and run all the way down here
into the human world where they will
wreak havoc and you see these little
blue lines going across that shows the
path that the orcs are generally going
to take and so then you have all these
different spells and traps you can only
pick so many of them at a time and you
put these traps down and these traps
kill orcs or slow them down or they do
something to assist with the orking the
fortress
yes I said we working because way around
we're gonna deep work the shit out of
this place there we go come the orcs
so I step on these little traps in the
spikes c'mon
in addition to my crossbow my infinite
ammo crossbow obviously bees first
levels are to be really bad easy
oh yeah
first wave is done in between waves you
get like a you seen I count down to
seven and six you get a little little
breather to set up more traps and I'm
sitting down like a car trap so they get
by my spikes the spikes skewer them then
they get the tar and the tar slows down
they get that far I can I can cut them
down with my sword its sward right
because it's got a W
we cut them down by cutter there
absolutely no threat at all see what
that I mean I'm in a reference to pain
there please
like
things are progressing well I don't even
need more crashing oh sit sit down or
just it'll hurt a lot
yeah just just me for now jackal will
show up later but now until exactly get
me around 8:30 till then it's gonna be a
quiet rich solo stream
talk and play game
how many of you are actually please
actually the first one doesn't have
co-op when Jack when Jack shows up we've
got a different plan actually after
after I string through this I might
stream Orcs Must Die to does have kalam
I guess I guess some other time I'd be
willing to play that and people can join
in but right now right now I'm just
doing the solo
all right as first few aren't that
excited I mean they're pretty pretty
basic level sir but the old man dead and
my apprenticeship finally over I can
draw on the full power of the rift I'll
get a new toy to play with every time I
defend a rift so for beating that last
level we got a new trap or a new item
every I guess you call them levels and
not missions whatever you want to call
them every stage you get a new weapon or
item respect the role all so we're gonna
use the arrow law these down here okay
so I guess I'll use them these are the
the DLC items yeah maybe a bit okay
but this fine actually happen
I just want to show you one facing the
ceiling zapper it's like a club zapper
for orcs
this is the best tower defense game on
stream i and steam I think so I haven't
played many tower defense games say the
honest truth I know
3d Dot Heroes has like a minigame tower
defense that I really like I probably
should play more because I kind of like
really liked this game I will know what
I will endeavor to seek out more tower
defense
wire hangers
why are you saying why understand you
want me to keep my children no more wire
hangers nobody nobody gets that than
they do you or whoever said that
Oshin
almost almost had a father
I forgot this entertaining and should
endeavor to fuck up walk
think of us a Futurama joke but it was a
mother robot like a child robot and the
child robot had hanging wires out of you
know out of its robot body and the
mother said no more hanging wires this
joke
mommy dearest Joe robots can't tell
jokes
there's the organiz hammer you'll see
what that does I guess it's kind of
obvious
other
$800 item akiles
Oh
flex and items have a secondary fire to
it crossbow like you saw I was doing the
studies people buy you some time
the sword specialist knock back don't
get much you said about
they'll like this
try this on for size put down some more
force bikes
yeah he's pretty much on the rails and
basically I've basically already wood
this needs Conan the Barbarian music
this needs heavy metal
guilty hug skinny pants get to go
fishing what's up
why can't its austerity
there we go on the rails on the rails
it's fine everything's fine I'm gonna
sail through this game no problems no
problems at all
by upgrades you can upgrade so you get
you get a number of skulls this you were
like reward for beating level if you do
really good you get five some orcs get
through you get four and so on and so
forth and then you can use those skulls
later to upgrade things tar is something
you end up using constantly it cost a to
upgrade its goals to upgrade I have ten
skulls yeah I'm gonna upgrade them all
right there we go
another day another fortress another
riff to defend they always seem to break
through the doors we should do something
about that this level usually gives me a
problem with the the par time there's
the time you have to beat it in to get
an extra skull and I had issues with
that and I'm gonna use the scorcher
stick-up thing that pops out of the
ground and shoots fire fire good
Frankenstein was wrong fire
good Frankenstein's monster
Frankenstein's monster who wasn't
hitting it I'm gonna get that wrong that
fucker jumping down my throat
not knowing that Frankenstein was the
name of doctor one for you yeah I know
alright here we go
skull some orcs
I smell
they love their skeletons isn't that
just the coolest thing
that one floor thing more will be at it
oh we have our first new enemy here
these are the crossbow works they shoot
at you I think that's obvious stuff
oh he didn't turn into fire oh there
I just don't stir bother you that bother
your sensibilities
this is a straight line headshots on the
wall
easy-easy of getting cocky things are on
the rails
I just gotta worry about beating you
time
it always seems to trip me up on this
you think that's better you see that
suppose Assam pops up there my old
strategy on this used to be too
guitar traps in there that I just
shooted the acid possible
I guess it takes you too long to walk up
there so tell him as many of them as I
can as early as I can occur
headshots
also you get a combo score based on the
number of traps that are affecting the
works
Sophie was watching through a car trap
while more things are sending fire his
way and like an arrow trap on the wall
with shooting arrows a time that that
that booster scored I'm not worrying so
much about combos going straight up
going none of the traps damage you
because this would be Terry a like I
couldn't even walk through here if the
traps damaged me so I'm fine I can walk
through swinging Mason it's kind of
necessary
it's game to be unfolded
wildly inaccurate machine gun fire
oh sure
I survived rub the Dancy does victory
dance
music great
right
I continued on you get the window for
beating that last state mushroom to work
with he think it's kind of an underrated
item for the orcs from the gate this
pits around to see this come in handy
sword cut a twin belt go with arrows tar
spikes
rocks come out of here they like to go
on either side this one say the blue
lines show where they go
typically
guitar right in front of the arrows so
by the time they get to it slows him
down some more cluster behind them
before the arrows go off wait chat
saying you can barely join me do you
want me to turn the music copper you
want me to turn me up what what is wrong
with the sound jet let me know let me
know what is wrong with the sound music
no wait am i doing my music turning
music up returning music down sound is
all good sounds good to me sounds fine
alright everything's staying as it is
one one spike traps not going to be much
golden edges I will add to it later
sunshine enriches troublesome times rich
mothers all the time
that's what I do
what was had by all
just keep adding spikes they're working
up great I assume they will keep working
out great
that's great everything's great
headshots will be
standard orcs like instantly
hang back pick offs money as I can from
a distance left traps do the rest
they get close switch to the belt
and dodge the fire one
how about some of this oh yeah
so first-person mode on this game help
it's not that I'm aware of
mom I know somebody's monitored
oh shit thank you
the back of the eye
a little present for you one for you and
one for you that's gonna leave a mark
rich do you like any realtime strategy
games I've talked about before I really
don't like real-time okay too stressful
trying to juggle two different things
that are going on once and two different
sides of the map with with strategy
games I prefer to have plenty of time to
just think about what my next move is I
don't care if it's not realistic is my
preferred style of play which is why I
love XCOM don't typically care much for
something like Starcraft
just going according to
he's fun
do this
that's down here we're not gonna get
that far but put those traps down anyway
say Chad I don't like the tension of
real time it's it's it's kind of
horrible that that horrible juggling
okay what's going on over here and all
guy did you try to manage things you
can't yes I'm sure there are people who
are godlike in those things but I can't
manage strategy with that because you
got to keep it simple because you're
juggling it's like I was playing a home
world I mean I like everything else
about a whole world other than the fact
that it's a real-time strategy game home
world I was like trying to juggle my
fighters at the same time I was juggling
my capital ships and it wasn't fun just
a headache
Jack talks about story and gameplay
homeworld is great I don't know if you
think that's up his alley or what image
action click the world just the manual
for that game the way they manage to
tell a story without having a direct
narrative with characters it's pretty
good it's like I remember the right the
manuals kind of written like a history
book for the race
ah we're done already
that one faster
yeah I saw that homeworld is being
released it's just I like everything
about homeworld other than the game I
like the idea of playing around with
large plates of ships I just don't like
the turn and though the real-time combat
this is like who's not much reason for
me to buy it I I had a copy of home
rolled back in the day I really wanted
to get into it I really did it's just
yeah I couldn't I couldn't all these all
these great ships and they're just
disposable units to build as many as you
can you send them out and things blow up
and you don't have time to coordinate
things ah it's not it's not for me
upgrade so I have I don't have the next
thing I have more upgrades not upgrading
anything we're gonna continue on rich is
too good at this game
not enough fuck-ups these are the early
levels trust me things are gonna get a
lot more difficult these attacks see
more
works for me I like it when all the
enemies bunch up for mass slaughter I I
predict
I am just going to coast through the
first nine stages that's my prediction
I could be horribly wrong and this could
end in some kind of humorous disaster
but my prediction is the first nine
stages coasted through no problems
things get hairy after that
we do my best though much to your
disappointment I'm gonna try my best
those little guys are kobolds they are
really quick and they run straight from
the ex they don't stop the Crichton
we got to watch out for that
when does the steam going till I read me
a while I mean Jack's gonna show up in
830 ish and we'll be streaming more
after that so I think you get a while
with streaming I mean until Jack shows
up it's just gonna be me
battling a little bit here and there if
you want you know I wouldn't even blame
you if you wanted to go away come back
home maybe enjoy time together people
you chat and that's reason to stick but
we know we know how great a conversation
I am when I'm just
especially when I'm playing a game now I
know not this next way but sooner or
later people are going to start pouring
out of this door so I'm just it sparing
a little bit early for that setting some
traps down in anticipation oh that is
this way
can't go back
I said those down when I did I could
have gotten ugly step right this way
stork
don't with some more
defenseless here
both the store and that other door
they're all coming around this corner so
I'm moving my archers over here
all right open the door
this exploding peril don't forget it yes
I think that would be a handy thing
really
a combo or a four on some of those
that's not bad oh by the refs see my
hubble's letting up a little bit low
just head by the rift in the rift
take these guys all out this on fence
set up over here
really overpowered
it's one of the DLC items I guess that's
that's the thing with deal secret isn't
it sometimes you get something that's
just overpowered
everybody bunches up around the barrel
and I blow the boards
we pour it and now there we go there we
go
not bad at all you'll see it's just a
way for a game's creator to realize
their little mission Oh bullshit blow
that out your ass teal'c's a cheap
fucking money-making scheme it's a way
to cut out content and charge you more
for it fuck you shove your DLC up your
ass
I'm creating those archers instantly
yes I got a little bit mad but we're
still friends we're still friends
another attack where our defenses are
thin if I didn't know better I think the
orcs were learning
so you get the entire before each level
I mean I already kind of know especially
there's at least really levels so I
don't need to survey around but you know
you have as much time as you want on the
normal difficulty to walk around before
the door gets knocked down and just to
plan out your attack like this one
the orcs come out of here and they split
up some good on that path and then some
go all the way up here and around so
then the new item I got for beating that
last mission was barricade and you can
use this to block out paths because you
it's it's to your advantage if you can
kind of funnel everybody into one area
so you can you can concentrate your
defenses out that one spot so rather
than letting the orcs go in two entirely
different directions I'm gonna block off
one of them and then gonna stack my
defenses in the other area take my sword
you know it's taking like the word
and I got a barricade which you're
actually you know what let's take a
wooden belt
it's like barricade and take an archer
its tar that's really all I need the
next one would just be padding and
fucking think yeah I think a barrel case
I want to blow something up I might use
that but I'm gonna block off this upper
path here right there so you see the
blue arrows now that you put the
barricades down the little blue lines
they come here and they stop they turn
around they go the other way I mean your
barricades gonna work if you completely
block off their access to the the
glowing blue rift they will break
barricades down they won't let you block
access to a barricade but if you just
block a path to one and there's another
path they'll take the other path and I
got this nice little overlook here and
we're gonna can afford mini right now
but we're gonna load this up with
archers and then we're gonna put the the
bottom bridge area down here we're gonna
slap some tar down there and we're gonna
win we're gonna win
unleash the hordes
many as you can of wants over home
quick though right
easy start throwing down some talk alert
archers will come next
great
best Star Trek captain anyone are you
saying Hart trap tower Trek as a joke
because I'm using the taro down there
was that a clever pun or was that just a
typo I'm going to assume typo I could be
wrong archers and it's just all gonna
get easier from here on out
launched up
he's easy
good times quick I go back into the
frame
a chance ass-kicking right there I don't
need trips just gonna kick everyone's
ass
these guys will just pull mom down like
the really kind of music
ever
more archers
so sorry for them
I guess I did use that barrel
we'll see if I need it
last wave
look at that look at that look at that
all into the acid
and you put down traps between ways
during the very food
you can't sell them during the way we
put more down
oh yeah like I said these these early
ones are gonna be pretty easy especially
if you know what you're doing there's
some stages down the road though they
just they basically just scare me
spring-trap this these are fun they're
not necessarily the most efficient
weapon but I personally get a lot of use
out of them this map there's a top right
- there's also a little mini-map
everything that's going on with an arrow
that's human it's really useful
sometimes we got two big doors and they
both go down these two hallways now
I can't barricade things off up here
because you're chill just break through
because there's no other way through but
I can put a barricade up on this side
because then they'll just go through
that middle hallway and I can funnel
them somewhere probably gonna have
archers focus on one side while I
personally take out the rest and acid
pits so I'm using a window
Archer barricade arrow spring
that's a fine loadout
they're all gonna come through on this
side which is where I won't put arrows
one little barricade here just to make
sure they don't like you know sneak
through here without catching any arrows
that's all my money that's all I can do
they are all dead healed up back into
the fray leave they come out on the
other side next we're in theory they
won't run into my arrows but they're
gonna die well before
get some archers up here cuz eventually
they're gonna start coming out of both
doors at once but he's first now notice
that there's one other stage
mr. spring traps
this will be good
spring-trap Birchers myself now they're
coming out of a forest a little bit
harder our first older
is he enough to do West it's harder when
they're bunched up with a whole bunch of
other words you're gonna get set off my
arrow traps you're already dead
possessed
holger on the other side oh shit hurry
up hurry up hurry up run run run run run
run
shit choo-choo choo-choo choo-choo
oh that got close that got real fuckin
close whoo
it's fun to watch it never look at that
look at that flying
okay
brutal
she's alive no deaths no orcs have
gotten through it so far every stage
five schools not doing bad put down some
more archers and if I can make this side
basically completely self-sufficient
that's good
yep there you go thanks Kong
ultra-smooth yes they are elf archers oh
I think names gonna call an elder in the
description tonight I'm not sure they
have the plate
I'll die
in the
if it ain't elven it ain't archers so so
they've never been real archers in
history every every every Archer has
been an elf I think you're wrong
come down
ostermueller
there we go
grace no I don't wish probably upgrade
the barricades but I think I think I'm
gonna throw my muse
except upgrade and let us move on my fan
of Lord of the Rings not not really as a
general rule I don't like generic
fantasy and Lord of the Rings is kind of
the originator of generic fantasy so
this map is actually pretty hard no acid
pits and a reason to bring the air belt
it feels cheap but I'm going I'm going
with the acid sorry a little bit cheap
and I'm gonna use archers and I'm gonna
use tar Scorchers and then we just got
this wall trap I'm gonna pick up one of
these
what do I consider on generic fantasy a
Star Wars
I'll think you know what I'll think of
more on that later but right now my game
is taking up too much of a percentage of
brain to think of other fantasy worlds
that have been less generic than your
standard fantasy with elves and orcs and
and and and with a little guys called
the dwarves
two-for-one are sure
so I kind of know this math I know the
first couple waves they're only out of
this door and then things get really
difficult on that door down there when
they break down that door and they're
coming out of both at once not good not
good
yes yes Dark Crystal would be
non-generic fantasy you don't see
Skeksis often or those weird four-legged
stilt things
I suppose he man can even kind of
counted
make it up with the Scorchers
that down below
and you know every in a few waves
sometimes to give you a break or you can
have as much time as you want to reach
your traps where you want them to be
don't let them all slow down and cluster
up before the flames pop up and in
theory I believe I can kill more that
way
important archers and then I'm just
gonna take out everybody that comes
through on the bottom on my own
take off
these guys
damn you
long sigh closely
or just be dumb
more archers will traps by the door
get get get thank you go mom the
Gauloise the guard okay
kill kill death right word die
we get smaller the other other white
meat
yeah
by
whoo
absolutely we'll run them down
who wants more traps I know between me
and the straps it should be enough
everything else archers
and he said like only two words yes
it's enough
keep an eye out constantly keep one eye
on that Minnie Mouse picture sometimes
sweetie by past those stairs
easy
what
yes
I'm not talking because you're getting
intense
yes archers archers archers more archers
that's already
as doing well hopeless top I like it
these jerks
they handled everything look great
run-run
oh shit
where are you
yes
ah split a ssin this game looks a
dynasty Warriors easy because I'm making
it look that way plus I'm still in the
early stages six upgrade points
I think barricades will be next Oh
woo
is anyone gun here we go ah the steam
trap which is completely useless
this is a trap New York walks over they
they just float up into the air for a
bit that's the trap that's what it does
it float mean they come back down then
they come back down what's what's going
on
smartness
acid pits some bring in a window and
archers archers archers all traps not
use it's our this time we're gonna get
some use out of the springs and then
that bad need anything else I don't need
anything else I'm gonna use some vampire
gloves what's the use of the steam trap
the steam trap I know it's it supposedly
it's good for building up combos if
you're going for a score like if the
stream leads up into an arrow that's
placed above the wall and you can you
can do combo II kind of things with them
but right now I'm not interested in that
I'm interested in death I'm interested
in orc murderer
like catnip for orcs
right
defense is set up
all of them
another door
this would be good
it sucks their health into you which I
suppose should be obvious based on the
name
it should look at thing tumble around
I got full minute without talking
members and main Shakman
right
but you guys can't wait till I have
somebody to talk to
I kept talking play games at the same
time not alone in that
this you made the name or
so that just happened don't okay we're
doing okay some new decorations traps
over here make this area self-sufficient
I can put in some more walled shoppers
over here something through your face
and stay the course things going well
things are going just swell how could
you love a gem in Seoul those dreams
they're terrible I've been quiet for the
last 25 minutes
just kill them just killing orgs it's
all I'm going and that's entertainment
huh easier than I thought
that's which cheap way
that VLC stuff is just overpowered
cement I did that mostly for speed
last wave just gonna load up purchase
nothing to do
it's already over
or should just give up
the dynamic
oh no that's oh shit
yup
oh I guess if you're tuning in late I
explained it when the when the game
started the orcs are trying to get to
the rift it's like a tower defense game
the rift is this blue glowing
dimensional portal portal that leads to
the human world and the orcs want to get
in there and just kill everything and
you have to stop them from getting into
the dimensional portal the rift I'll
I'll show everybody who didn't tone in
at the start of the stream that they
started the next to Matt and I can't
afford to upgrade my barricades yet one
more skull you get a lesser score if
work one or gets through I mean you
could let quite a few through uh I don't
I don't I don't know I think I think
they all have to get in for you to lose
but I mean it's kind of you know just
feels bad
if you feel like one skull on a level at
the end of each level you get like a
score based on souls one one two five
skulls if you do a perfect job if you do
it in in the allotted amount of time and
nobody gets through you get five skulls
if you either take too long or one work
goes through the rift you lose the skull
and it was like such a percentage of
orcs get through then you lose another
two skull and so on dogs they just kind
of they kind of rate the performance and
all right you can see my my this this
number here on this particular stage I
can only 2020s the number that I have to
avoid that's the number every time it or
cuts through the rift that goes down one
so that counts down I can what twenty
through it's different in some of them
looks like a lot more someone's thrown
five some it's fifteen and let me let me
select my my load out here it's kinda
like a tower defense game so taking
taking my sward doesn't like the tarp
trap that slows orcs down this is acid
bombs that melt orcs arrow traps they
they go on the side of walls and work
orcs go by the arrow traps the arrows
fly out new to this level is the push
trap what you put on the side of a wall
and it's like a little spring that comes
out and it will knock works over it will
knock them off the side of cliffs if the
trap is putting your a cliff barricades
kind of lock off areas you'll see the
stuff in action so what happens is the
orcs first out of these doors doors or
my canadian and you see these little
little blue lines coming out that shows
you what path the orcs are gonna take so
they're gonna they're gonna split up and
go down either side of this thing and
they're gonna run down here and they're
gonna try and get in the rift here your
goal is to stop the orcs from getting
here so there's that door there and then
on this map there's an other door over
here so you're going to have to split
your attention between the two doors
and put barricades up so I have to worry
about less pathways I'm gonna keep the
orcs from getting through on your side
so all the orcs that come out of that
one door door I'm Canadian today why am
i Canadian all the orcs come out of that
door they're gonna they're gonna come
down through here so I know that I can
line this area with a lot of craps to
kill those particular orcs work sink
work a lot work work
I'm gonna push trap here so that'll
shove them into this acid bath it'll
hurt a lot
this will be good
yeah that's a good spot for that
first few waves I'm good and have to
worry about that other door down there
so my goal is to build up build up this
side so this side is pretty much
self-sufficient and then when the orcs
are coming through the other door I'll
be able to and
right there that's the spot oh he's a
good one
spring-trap
site is pretty good at handling its own
affairs though this area off because I
know the next wave they're gonna start
coming out of that back area so I have
to hope that these traps these traps
take care of all of them the orcs from
that door
and everything over here I'm gonna have
to handle on my own
why are the orcs trying to kill you it's
their works
they want to get into the game or to
rape and recovery soon
he'll up you up
I know these things I'm looking at
this'll hurt
remember
Grossman now they're coming out of both
doors
can you ever have too many traps
thinking no two more waves
I'm pretty good the pretty
self-sufficient
all right the last wave
work over whatever
whoo
eyes
there we go that's not really wool woody
it didn't get that close I mean I got a
little bit hectic in that last one but I
wasn't that that was not all worthy I'll
be one later on hopefully hopefully
gotta have a drink a loved one have your
drink
what upgrade my barricades Tim you wan
you want a semi whoo whoo how's that
said semi enough all right this is my
new item for meeting that level hot
chicks but you know that's just that's
just great I get hot chicks for beating
that level here's what I'll show you
what the hot chicks do after the
cut-scene adolescence I was a lousy
teacher but he was the worst kind of
student dim-witted foolish and too
stubborn to focus on the fundamentals
that's why the order paired us up they
sent their best and brightest to learn
from other more patient warm ages I got
the bottom of the
the joke's on them those brilliant young
minds are dead along with most of their
masters slaughtered trying to defend the
rifts the world is still doomed of
course there aren't enough war majors
left now there are laughs if the last
one left standing is him I've made
contact with the orders Weaver's on the
far side of the rift the weavers have
read all the old books they should be
able to hook me up with magic goodies
okay for the record my drink was Diet
Pepsi so I'm sorry I'm sorry it was Diet
Pepsi I just acted drunk because comedy
all right
pick up my weapon loadout first and
foremost
built in the polar gloves archers
arrows yes tar and push traps
hey I hate the later partner of the
stage I do
alright enough time for the chicks
they're called the weavers
I guess they weave spells I guess that's
their thinking there's the elemental
Weaver and the steel Weaver steel Weaver
augments like your your traps and your
your archers on other your Guardians I
have gotten the Paladin chapter like a
big guys with swords but they they she
enhances your the people you summon and
your traps the elemental Weaver she and
enhances like your weapons the spells
you use like the wind belt and you can
you can see like it has a little
description of like little upgrade paths
she has you can choose one of them you
don't you're not stuck with the whole
game every every level you get to choose
one of the two actually there's a third
one that pops up later but right now I
just have the two right now I'm going to
go with the elemental Weaver for 12,000
points upgrade your sword and put my
crossbow and my thwart death word I'm
gonna upgrade that
you see all right so enchanted weapons
game the flame crossbow and holy sword
I'm not gonna spend money on it just yet
but then you can further upgrade you
know Trent on the brush playerhealth
doubled melee kills make you faster then
the final upgrade you know crossbow and
blade staff kills grant 5% of the mana
bar which helps out with your spells
spells spells are okay they're not as
cool swords
it's right now where no beccamike I'm
gonna even need them so we're sticking
with we're sticking with the holy
weapons Cantona so you see my crossbow
was flaming and my swords got like a
blue glow that flies down my arm
she's pretty deep pretty neat alright
this particular stage is an upper level
and a lower level
the orcs come out from this door and
then up above me there's a pathway above
me when they come out in the door so I
have to split my attention between two
different portals it's kind of a bitch
so fish traps
knock the orcs down when they come
through this way oh I didn't take that I
didn't say alright I'm dead I didn't
take the forest or trees but I'm gonna
have some arrow traps up here
so you now know that that elemental
Weaver I'm much better at decimating
works about tribes
easy easy
coming up the top
by
right outside of they come out next I
don't remember where they come out next
it's okay I'll be fine
it's all good oh these are the Knowles
come truce these guys they don't care
about getting in the rift they just
tracked you down murdered he or any
archers
if they hit you you get like poisoned
and you slow down so it's kind of a pain
in the ass you're not careful these guys
can kill you pretty quick especially
when there's more than one
speed and health do i watch don't waste
what I've given or the more shit dark
it'll hurt a lot
that's gonna leave a mark
faster
that's gonna leave a mark right there
that's a spot
okay it's probably not enough secure of
problems on their own but
kill them all
kill them all great words of advice
down below
constantly look at the math - just to
make sure numbers sleeping up on that
I got the top again
anyone good for what in my arms just
take care of it it's 20 okay I'm
assuming nobody got through oh boy
how do I want to defend this area
got a little present for you one for you
and one for a few I want this bottom
area not require my attention at all
in fact I want to go now keep those
should I've got no
maybe I will do further Weaver upgrades
after this next wave something things
don't go horrible burn an arc for me
we've got to our archers just nice
frost affects 33% duration I don't have
the the ice spell yet though when belt
33% increased force I don't know if that
pushes them further which actually could
be bad I might blow them into the the
rift so I'm just gonna go with the
everyone use it's done that much but I'm
mites
chatez saying I don't love you what what
is what brings that on
here again
the exact same damn path
was it your okay you know that oh this
is it there's the grand finale
quick
go back up top traps can handle the
crossbow guys
oh my our skill good good good good
this is going well
I have no losses
none of these guys gonna make it to the
rim I don't wave of these guys all right
hurry up hurry up hurry up
am I gonna look easy oh wait they're up
top the red tongue
whoo that was a whoo
they want to upgrade
afford to upgrade anything useful
language when does this game get
challenging I am kind of a veteran at
this game it is challenging the we're
getting into the stages where things are
challenging I'm sorry for your ears see
now I say this is gonna get challenging
and I'm right now I'm about to make this
look very easy though that that last one
you don't realize how difficult that
last wave yes I made it I made it look
easy goddamn it try it yourself and see
God yeah whatever whatever
you people fire I have I have fire now I
can shoot fire from my fingertips
because I am a god
do I even need anything else
not really
never use one of these before
they like this one
that's
oh no with elements of again that work
small for me
typically we'll make a good team burning
oil
don't waste what I've given all right
here we go
like I said I'm gonna make this one look
very easy cuz there's just a blatant
choke point here they all run into
making it look too easy I have to dumb
myself down a bit this won't hurt a bit
this is this whole stage it's just kind
of a gimme
if you know the strategy this is a gimme
I'm just gonna lay out some archers and
we're just we're gonna coast we're gonna
coast this one's a breather this one's
like you need a break through the last
level or two so I take a pick a nap I
guess the name is a cute this is called
choke point and you're supposed to
barricade this up I think I think that
was the intent
yes sir fire safety jokes I get it I get
it
I understand breakfast
yeah on the rails
I don't even need to build more I don't
even summon more archers I'm pretty good
to go this is just overkill at this
point come on wake up
and yeah why the fuck not
excellent
it's not rumors that booth marchers
I'm behind the barricades
and away we go
they're not even getting to the llama
anymore I've got so many archers kind of
guitar you know what it is
this is overkill
they're not even getting to my my choke
point disaster area trap of doom of doom
I'm ready to get her bruised from
crowding myself on the back that heart
you're you're probably right
you won't be sorry
yep there we go I can't move that I
can't do that you won't be sorry rich I
won't be sorry for what what mister a to
mr. a to 12
um oh I didn't even use the dead man uh
thing whatever I don't need it alright
continuing on pounder I'm not gonna use
that a highly situational weapon that
doesn't come into use all that often
yeah I'm gonna use that see this is just
one large open area to rifts they can
run towards this one will be difficult
this might be where the first orchids
through
I'm gonna need archers no longer eat are
gonna use the wall choppers might use
arrows
though I use anything else
berrak it was so expensive to barricade
all this shit off
it's now
I could barricade but I wouldn't have
any money left for traps
that's the Scorchers
and we're going with steel Weaver
increases money from traps I have so
many things to shoot does that hole
right there that spot just for you
for you one for you and one for you
look at three four now
oh boy
there we go
looking good
kill up me heal up quick heal up Chris
you look quick
yes
whoo
straight with the fire arrow guardians
alright here's what she does
orcs killed by traps and Guardians are
in 66% 66% more coins Guardian armor
Guardians have increased health I took
that swagging at this burning pitch
elves gain flame arrows and generate
more combos actually if I do that I
won't have any money left to buy more
archers so maybe what I'm going to do
instead is I'm gonna buy a ton of
archers first and then the next chance I
get then I will start upgrading the
archers in the hopefully they can hold
that one dorm
decisive I like that
perhaps tutelage
burning arrows very well then
whoo all right now look at all that
money I got
I have money in fire archers turn into a
duck shoot
oh hello here what's up
let me try and turn your sound up on my
end here okay talk to me you're on the
air
we're we're in the thick of it we're
fighting off some orcs I've got I've got
flaming archers um which let me I'll tab
here how is how is Jack sound chat how
is Jack sound is he - cool he's
somebody's - quiet incredibly quiet all
right let me can I get to a menu in this
game without shutting it down well I'm
gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna mess of the
game sound and then I'm gonna turn you
up on open broadcaster okay as far as
Jack being echoey as they say as not
much I can do about that if that's the
case I'm gonna talk I could see where my
levels are Jack can you talk in my radio
friendly voice nice even
well-articulated
words okay chat how do I need to adjust
Jack because they need to be louder an
hour or C good what do you guys
she's still quiet all right I can fix
that I can fix that
Jack talk some more I'm talking some
more this is me talking at my normal
talking miss levelness way loader way
louder we we are at full volume which do
you need me to be louder like I can turn
up my mic on my end well let's see what
that day want me to try that okay your
town is next rich can't make me not dumb
I'm born dumb and I'm gonna die down
that's just the way life is okay now
you're gonna have to do it on your end
okay now I just said it on my end
and I was significantly louder to me you
just saw more echoey anymore well that
echo is not the right word form you
sound digitally ish like a digital fuzzy
kind of off buffle does that sound much
better does it sound much better if I go
like this no no okay
they're saying I sound distorted hold on
I'm gonna unmute this dream
oh is that I wonder if I was too
okay now am i you sound better I don't
know about volume but now now I don't
the distortion is gone okay I think I
might have been thinking as far as
making me louder that's all you this is
yeah yeah well we've had the issue when
I call him when you're doing the solo
streams and I'm quiet we might need this
to start and stop the stream oh sure
sure I could try that
yeah let's sort it still quiet I'm gonna
start and stop the stream everybody will
be back in one second
