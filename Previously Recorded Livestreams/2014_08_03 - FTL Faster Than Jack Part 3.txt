hello everybody should I say hello
everybody hello everybody we're just
gonna let this amazing music fill our
beings our moment while we wait for
everyone to come into the stream
hey everybody starting a little earlier
than we usually do how long tonight is a
good question I am my a my only the only
thing we are doing tonight is finishing
this game of FTL so it could be ten
minutes it could be a couple hours I
want to say we have I want to say we
have three more worlds and then the
final boss battle so if our luck holds
out we could go for a while tonight
you should tell octave J says I should
totally do a bit of Isaac tonight you
know how about this if we go under a
half an hour if we go under a half an
hour we'll do an Isaac run just just to
even things out a little bit
that's right Billy hecka you're on the
ship
what hipster Superman says that you'll
be fooling around with terraria while
listening I think that's a great idea I
I messed around with terraria a little
bit it was a free it was a PlayStation
Network game that was free for a little
bit and I didn't get terribly into it
imma be that bun what's on the snacks
list tonight um I might let my very last
beer every usually every weekend I buy a
four pack of MKE brewing top freak and
finally Monday night I have my last one
so excellent snack one of my favorites
right now play don't starve already I
don't know if I'll get into don't starve
I don't know if I have I don't know if I
have the dedication for don't starve
what oh I apologize Ark and if I'm
interrupting your viewing of anything ed
Witten whiskey sour I like whiskey sour
I I also just like whiskey on the rocks
I really enjoy that any sort of on the
rocks for a while I was really into
vodka gimlets which is just vodka and
and lime juice over ice I don't know I
think that was an entire summer an
entire summer I drink nothing but vodka
gimlets
got a preview of the next best of the
worst no no we haven't filmed the next
best of the worst in Boise is always
good Mike and Jay were not drunk for the
newest half in the bag unless they drank
at the movie theater
we all saw guardians of the galaxy in
the afternoon then rich and I went back
to the studio to set up the stream and
Jane Mike and Jesse went to go see
boyhood and they filmed the discussion
that night while we were streaming at
Friday night there during the Josh
stream and so unless they drank at the
movie theater I don't believe they were
drunk during that filming yes this is a
jack on my stream this is a rare stream
a rare Monday night stream a rare Monday
night stream because we started this
game of FTL last night and we we are
gonna have a killer run we we're having
a killer run great items we've had some
ups we've had some downs I am
emotionally invested in this ship
getting to the destination so I decided
that we should finish this up tonight a
very special Monday night stream you
know what ed Witten wants to know my
opinion on spiced rum I don't much care
for it I'm putting that out there
I think the shake loose I think you're
still alive I forget we're gonna get
there vapor space says I just presume
Mike and J are always drunk that's fair
I think that's fair yeah nice try kiddo
he says he's just finished watching part
two like we are having an amazing run
I'd love some more weapons you know
we're gonna get to it I'll just move to
the continue screen so we can kind of
show where we're at here oh is this
where I left it I really thought we were
past this
we are oh that's right that's right
this person would they were trying to be
pirates and we had to convince them not
to be pirates that's right junk a die ok
shake I will I will call you shake you
no one lost in Technicolor this the
soundtrack does sound a lot like
Kraftwerk
I think you are correct
someone is asking what kind of coffee do
I like I like a nice light roast now
that we are in the summering months I
make my own iced coffee and so I brew a
cold brew a coffee concentrate so I tend
to use a little bit of a darker roast
like a medium or a dark a medium dark
roast because I find that works better
for diluting the concentrate but still
giving me that strong coffee flavor yeah
let's see who's alive okay so Mario
Mario is our captain fully-loaded
captain stats super captain dick the
birthday boy is still alive as our
engine guy fully loaded engine stats
Kieran is on weapons fully loaded
weapons and Kieran if we get you to fix
a couple more things we're gonna get you
we're gonna get you more some more
repair skill which is great we got Rory
Tate
Rory Tate is one of our boarding party
and look at that fists tat all Rory
taking
our kind of extra crew member he just
hangs out in case we need an extra
fixing president tres Jin is on shields
fully loaded Billy hack one of our extra
crew members Oh Billy akka is going to
be one of our fixer extraordinaires and
of course her roof one of the very last
to join is the second part of our
boarding party let's get everyone healed
up while we kind of wait for everyone
Mauri Mauri I get in there Mario get in
there Kiran get in there
shake get in there everybody heal up
getting nice and healed previously
recorded live condiments and coffee junk
ed wants to know how many new Godsmack
albums I will buy the answer is zero I
can't I can't even name a Godsmack song
I'm very sorry the shaky that's right
you are
Jake is a redshirt you're just there
you're basically there to fill space and
really sorry about that I'll actually
hold on for a second guys
sorry about that okay now we're back now
we're back to it everyone's fully healed
so here's where we're at
let's see where we're at actually can I
am what can I see here we got a hundred
and five scrap that's great can I see
the normal difficulty
something I could see where we were in
the grand scheme of things I think we
can do that once we want to jump to get
more energy I should get more energy
we've been we've been kind of evolving
back and forth basically yeah my only my
only concern is I'd love to get two
extra weapon slots to get my swarm
missiles up and running and if I could
I'd love to get a fourth level shields
just because why the eff not you know
let's see here
do you like rush um you know the few
songs I've heard but I'm not a brush fan
okay so let's let's let's les what do we
want to do well let's see what's in the
area there's a store here so I should
save that scrap for healing actually
yeah let's go to the store first and
then we can always double back here go
here here let's heal ourselves first get
some fuel
grant recovery armor it's always we
don't have anything to sell let's see
here zoltan bypass shield could be
really useful right now because I want
to say that the end boss at one point
gets a Zoltan shield so I'm gonna say
fuck it and we're gonna get his oath on
shield we're gonna get some fuel and
we're gonna fix the rest that we can
orient it Lee's gonna try to get us up
to the green great another field alright
great
I think that's that's a good start now
now we can really fuck some enemies up
all these FTL streams possibly
confirming new spacecab move it maybe
maybe and I do see PI 460 asked what my
favorite they might be giants song is
there's so many probably a nying maybe
statue got me high anything off a flood
and you're getting off a flood I love
slut alright what are we gonna do here
sector six can I can't look at the whole
map I don't know where sector six I
think I only have two more sections
there's a great sectors here here here
here
earrings that I can probably do let's
give that a dresser alright alright
we're gonna reject that off or we don't
need that and actually I can get rid of
my medbay and one more two engines do
that even this might be smart go here
down here here yeah let's do that okay
here we go battle music despite their
precautions pirates have begun to harass
the local Zoltan settlements across this
sector one such pirate sponsorship and
moves into attack alright so they have
you can pause the game any time quick
refresher is they have a teleporter so
they're gonna come and teleport on our
ship they have this could this looks
like a bomb they have a laser and this
looks like a beam weapon beam weapons
cannot penetrate shields but if they can
get your shields down really fuck up
your shit so first and foremost we need
to get rid and they don't have a med bag
great and so what we're gonna do first
and foremost is we are going to eff up
their engines we got our burst laser in
our flack warming up let's start an
effing up their engines
all right so they teleported over here
and they're gonna mess with our doors
what can we do let's fight them you know
Sultan's aren't known for their fighting
skills I don't believe my flak cannon
your wall right
black boom nice
was that oh that's their bomb
great-great-great black cannon again I'm
it out and they have no weapons and
they're all dead
excellent now that their ship has been
emptied of hostiles you search it
eventually you find a prisoner who
offers to join your crew but I'm so
sorry Joel we don't need you
you can only have eight crew members so
sorry we would love to have you
great great excellent excellent job
shake and Billy you really you really
brought your a-game
you helped defend the ship so thank you
thank you for that Jack the flag attack
that's right that's right
good girl I know it's a Monday stream
it's it's unusual because last night
during my solo stream we were playing
this game and it got way too late so I
wanted to save it for today so that's
what we're doing that should catch you
up all right so I can move here
let's move here can I get another I can
let's get another bar just get that
engine up to full evade 40% of aid
that's great
before I can probably do that I can
probably do that one hit all these
points get all the scrap we can you jump
into a debris field that used to be a
zoltán cruiser
unfortunately it's NGS core takes you
for the attacker and retaliates they
refused all hails all right ng crew
engies are pretty weak they don't have a
med bay what do they have drone control
oh I think these are missiles yeah all
right let's get in there and start start
an effing up their drone control hacking
the other so they're hacking our they're
hacking our our viewing system our
scanners if you will so we can't see
what's going on in there but that's
alright because we are gonna fuck them
up yeah if they time their shots right
which luckily they don't a lot of the
times but if they time their shots right
they could completely remove my shield
and hit me with some of that stuff so we
obviously just don't want that to happen
there we go there we go get back up
there shields
we're gonna take out their drones as
quickly as possible actually I think we
have enough health where we can just
take out the remaining two energies
before they get any of their weapons
online let's do that yeah get him get
him get him get him
Brock guys are slow rock guys are slow
it's gonna I have my thumb on the pause
button the spacebar is the pause button
and I just have my thumb on it
constantly because if it looks like
their health gets too low just pause it
eject them out of there great excellent
scrap reward everything is awesome
that's great one that was a great one
John kilo asks can you have more than
one ship in this like a fleet or is it
just one ship it's always just one ship
the more times you play you can unlock
different ships that have different
abilities but it's always just one ship
you know there are some things that are
constant like you always can only have
eight crew the upgrades you can get the
optional upgrades are usually the same
but you know you just choose in what
order they're in
but I love some of the different ships
are really fun like you can unlock this
ng ship so it can be it can get pretty
fun but it's always just one ship which
is nice I hate this this is the worst in
Nebula levels where there's just nothing
there because that gives me nothing no
scrap no nothing three fuel left gotta
watch that come on
all right I can do distress and then
exit need that's crap need that scrappy
oh nothing
alright damn it
kind of a waste of fuel but that's what
happens sometimes
and we jump to the next sector oh my god
no we only have one more sector before
the end of the fight this is great
alright and we're out of fuel
all right so what happens when you're
out of fuel it is obviously it says no
fuel and so I'm gonna turn my distress
beacon on and what we're gonna do is
wait and what it does is it waits a full
cycle and see here although your lack of
fuel cells prevents your ship from
jumping you can still use your impulse
engines well you spend some time
exploring the nearby system yes dammit
dammit dammit dammit
a rebel ship jumps nearby I wasn't
looking forward to patrolling this
border sector but here you are the most
wanted ship in the area just asking for
me to find you it looks like it's my
lucky day they power up their weapons
alright so this is gonna be a awful
awful fight I think what I'm actually
gonna do is take off the burst lasers
and warm up the swarm of missiles they
have an anti-personnel drone here they
have a helper drone here and they have a
med bay so my boarding party tactics
aren't going to work that well they also
have what looks to be a four missile
launcher r4 lasers so this is a bad
weapon right here and this is a big
missile launcher and so the our only
objective here is is killing them as
soon as possible and if we can destroy
either this or their med bay
then we are in luck I just won one flag
one fucking missile let's get our swarm
to three and just rain some help
alright great so now we are going to
flak their shields and missile their
missiles
boom nice it's nice
okay got a fire let's get a rock guy in
here to help put out the fire
how we doing otherwise
I'm pretty good all right now let's flag
their shields again and we are gonna
swarm this Jimmy here come on whoa whoa
whoa who's dying dick the birthday boy
we are not losing you dick the birthday
boy dick the birthday boy get into the
medical Bay
we're gonna have a shake little huh zero
repair skill yeah shake little we're
gonna have shake little coming in there
and help repair and why not mantis isn't
doing anything right now
fucking hell eat more missiles so the
way these four missiles work that is
really cool I can fire one and it's a
relatively short time or I can wait
until all of these three little
canisters fill and I get to fire three
missiles it's just obviously patience
game all right here we go
lagging their shields
yes taking them out one by one
taking them home all right now everyone
get back to your positions because we
need our engine guy in the engine all
right never mind
rotate back my mouse is acting up again
Rory tape get back in there you get back
in there I'm straight I'm putting out
fires they're gonna take this fucker out
I swear it you get in there helping
repair your shields you get in there
pair them shields
see if we can put their drums a little
bit
dammit dammit not doing the greatest and
I have no fuel to run away so I need to
kill them and it's that anti-personnel
drum that's really gonna fuck with me in
there repair you and for fair oxygen do
it do it do it come up you can do it
shake low now you stay in that shake low
Oh No shake low oh fuck go get in there
that was disheartening to say the
fucking least
ah terrible all right breathe breathe
everyone
oh yeah
everybody breathe Mario Mario he'll take
the birthday boy he'll Kiran he'll
back to places
Rahil Dresden he'll Billy he'll all
right
back to it Shaco you need to heal
alright kilo we're just gonna wait for
our oxygen to come back to a hundred
percent giggorilla i I was initially
just planning on finishing this game if
I think I said that if if I die in under
a half an hour and we're getting close
to the half-hour mark if I died under a
half an hour I'll play something else
maybe my place around a binding of issac
but I had initially planned on just
finishing this but we'll see we'll see
if we're in the mood I mean you know
once you start playing games it's really
hard to stop you're right
you're right I need to reverse
polarization that always works this is
just the worst we are in a seriously bad
position here because now the red line
of the rebel fleet is here so we're
gonna wait and here they are they're
gonna get us they're gonna get us on
this turn here they come
so
swarm on engines on we're gonna go full
fucking boarding team here and you know
what we're gonna board is in their
boarding area boom
how do I pick that up didn't see that
coming did get fucks I get an airplane
black
no that's oh that's right whose time you
can get them you can get them you can
get them now you can't you go over there
Rockman go in here and finish them off
with a teleport back those lazy fucks
get our guys back get our guys back okay
their weapons are completely down but we
can still get attacks from other things
but we need to destroy them is the thing
done done no this is actually this is
actually something they added they
recently added a huge expansion to FTL
you know new characters new alien races
new new things and one of the new things
they added it was further incentive to
stay away from the rebel fleet so and
you not only have to fight the rebel
ship but the other rebel ships who are
in the fleet are firing at you and I
that's what happened I had these guys on
the ropes because all their weapons were
down I got hit by another part of the
rebel fleet
yes John Kela we lost a lot of good
subscribers on that ship yeah let's do
binding of issac what let's say fucking
let's do a binding of issac oh god damn
it that's just it you guys are gonna see
a black screen don't worry about seeing
a black screen I'm gonna get binding of
issac up and running but you're gonna
see a black screen what a terrible way
to end FTL a terrible terrible way to
end FTL all right so what do we need to
do either we need to go here
here we're gonna get it real quick here
guys don't worry
quick quick does this do it this does it
great
here's Isaac here's Isaac and we are we
also all that I need to also enable our
joy to ki because I play Binding of
Isaac with a controller as I do most
things you're absolutely
