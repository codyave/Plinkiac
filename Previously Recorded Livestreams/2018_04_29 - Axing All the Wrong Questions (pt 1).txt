it's muted hey hey hey what's going on
you guys missed all the riveting
conversation about how I was talking
about how we couldn't tweet the riveting
yeah we're early the original plan today
we had plans film a review for this yeah
but I I would like to play more of the
game I would like I would like to get
further in the game before we do that
rich isn't quite at a point where he can
talk about the full game yeah I would
like rich to finish the story with doing
that I'd like you to finish the story
problem is we don't get games two weeks
advance yes that is the problem and
enricher you had nothing else happening
this week no other no other things to
watch no other big reviews to do the
other day yeah that was that was off the
table a few days ago oh yeah I
understand I understand it's the jury on
this game still I'm actually liking it
those game was growing on me more and
more than more I've plated
I have very complicated feelings about
the game and overall I don't think I
like it you cannot count but there are
lots of parts of the games that I do
like of the game that I do like right so
you know it's complicated I do like the
head and there's a head hanging on my
bell temple in the lake of the night and
I'll get you to your home I promise that
had talks to me and and he's funny you
know Scottish accent yeah this head from
Norse mythology talks to me in a
Scottish accent yeah I think it's that's
fine that's fine it's fine
conversationalist
here we go boom
so you're still playing breath of the
wild basically as soon as I got done
with the story to this game I went right
back back to breath of the wild and I've
gotten a little further in the ballot of
champions DLC once you get past the
one-hit obliterator stuff it's it's
sailing well and you know like when you
have time to focus on the one-hit
obliterator stuff it's very it's nice
it's neat it's a different way to play
the game though I did discover while the
one-hit obliterator
replaces all other all of your melee
weapons yeah you still get your bow and
arrow yeah so then it's just like oh I
can destroy everyone with my bows and
arrows and not worry about getting hit
at all so Jack what I I asked this
knowing full well the answer no yes yes
what is your least favorite aspect of
Zelda breath of the world my least your
same least favorite aspect of it you
know obviously like I have a few qualms
with the game but I overall I would say
my least favorite aspect is the weapon
braking the weapons braking the weapon
braking thing I don't I don't like
having to constantly pick up new weapons
it's like when they break yet I like
being comfortable with my one weapon so
you were you were all excited about the
DLC at first because you thought oh it's
gonna make the Master Sword permanent
fixture permanent fixture permanent
fixture that Master Sword and love that
then you find out no it really doesn't
it just makes it stronger
Oh Jack what how much would you give for
a DLC or something that would give you
infinite durability how much would you
pay
Oh infinite durability on the Master
Sword okay yeah infinite durability on
the Master Sword and that and then we
could assume that I could pick up the
Master Sword you know like it never runs
out of energy or whatever runs out of
energy
whoo would you would you pay $10 for
that yeah I don't know if I'd pay
attendant you wouldn't pay $10 for that
I don't know I you know that's that's a
tricky question your biggest gripe with
the game yeah we're willing you were
really what it was 20 what you were all
over that when you thought the the DLC
was gonna add in durability well but you
get you get bonus content with that like
yeah you're talking about standalone
just one weapon DLC no other content
yeah no no you hear you get like oh well
you get some trials you get some new
stuff to do you get some new bonuses and
also ah you know maybe five bucks okay I
thought it might be more your single
biggest gripe with the game good uh yeah
I I will I will say this upon my second
playthrough I've changed up a lot of my
playstyle and I'm avoiding a lot more
fights this time and so it's definitely
less of an issue for me okay Jack rich
what if I told you
that that theoretically theoretically
you could go home tonight and have
infinite durability on your master sword
what infinite durability Jack how would
you feel about that I would call you a
liar and a fool you would call me a liar
and a fool I I would say rip I'd say
rich Evans there's no mods on the
Nintendo switch so Jack what if I told
you that in theory you could go home
tonight tonight and have infinite
durability on every item in the game
every weapon every elemental weapon
every shield infinite durability endless
what what if I told you you could have
that I would ask you how because this
seems like a pipe dream what what if I
told you jack what if I told you that
this isn't a joke I'm interesting how
interested are you more interested in
just one moment
I finally tweeted okay now I mean okay
now that I'm telling you that I am NOT I
am being dead serious
I can get infinity go home tonight yeah
have evident durability not just in the
master sword but on all of the fire rods
all of the Spears all of the clubs so
that all of the shield I could just have
whatever weapons I wanted whatever
weapons you wanted all the time all
right
how much would you pay for this I don't
know man I'm sticking with my $5 I don't
know how important this is I what I
don't know what the gag is here I'm not
kidding
what if I told you Jack the only price
was your soul jack
you know you're not a believer you're
not a believer you don't believe in
Souls would you would you would you give
up your very soul to have a husband of
durability on every item in Zelda Jack I
would need I would need some some sort
of clear-cut legal definition on what
you consider my soul to be because you
know a lot of people think that soul is
just like you know your free will you
wouldn't you go home tonight all the
weapons infinite durability tonight you
know what you know the only thing a cost
Jack you need to play it on an emulator
the the the emulated Wii U version of
the game which which because if you play
it on a good enough PC actually looks
and runs better that the version on the
switch I believe that it has mod Jack
and you can have infinite durability on
everything in the game but it would cost
a little piece after you've cost a
little piece your soul Jack you'd have
to use an emulator I am downloading it
right now I do hear they've gotten it to
run pretty smoothly I do hear that would
you do it
No
no what if I told you Jeff what are you
can we just keep this what if I told
Jeff it happening all night because I
love it
not only jag can you get infinite
durability on the master sword on all of
the magic rods all of the magic swords
all of my Spears like I could just all
of the she'll have a shield that never
breaks and never break the sword and
like just not only that oh there's a mod
you can play as female link an extensive
mod where they have not just changed the
model they've they've gotten a voice for
it oh god they've gotten some I think
some new animations and some new facial
features just for the female link mod
what if I told you Jack that the the
bastard cycle you get the DLC yeah you
can mod that to be a giant floating
banana that that interests me I don't
really care about there's another mod
that turns it into the Road Runner the
the Looney Tunes Road Runner yeah that
guy sends a goofiness for me but like if
you're just telling me that they could
give me the motorcycle without having to
work for it you know night sock you can
play as linkle winkle li n ki and a li n
k le Winkle Winkle that's the female is
female link tonight wait for DLC to come
out you just got to play it on an
emulator guy just have to give up all of
my morals yes for and it would be
everything I would ever everything you
ever wanted out of that game Jack you're
the dick PC running at 4k oh my god oh
my god native 4k no upscale and go and
probably significantly smoother than it
runs on my switch cuz I still get a lot
of free traffic
oh Jesus I was curious I thought this
might be the thing that gets Jack to use
it oh I know I mean that's tempting that
early you own the game yeah I know
that's a bigger bigger issue than just
that that is fairly tempting fairly
fairly telling you can tell rich was
looking forward to this bit all day I
was you know not looking forward to this
bit all day rich texted me at like 11
o'clock last night basically and you
just said said Jack just in case I
forget I have something I need to talk
to you about on stream and this is like
11 o'clock at night like so rich I was
like I'm about to go to bed and he's
like I made a special text just to me
like this is going down I don't I don't
I don't care about the infinite
durability but there's some other visual
mods I show you out oh that looks neat
though sure new versions of that shield
bet looks neat I bet that's what I'm
interested in yeah yeah
no that would be nice and you know I I
get it I get it not not quite enough to
tempt me but very close yeah mostly just
because I don't know if I if I feel like
playing it after I'm done with this
playthrough I don't know if I'll feel
like playing it again
I see I'm half I'm half way through it
my free play after hearing about all
this shit I can do with the the emulated
version I'm gonna start from scratch
again
I think halfway done with a complete all
the shrines playthrough yeah fuck it I'm
starting over starting over certain
emulating all right I mean that's you
know you can mod out the rain slipping
Oh see now you're talking see I would
hesitate to do anything that would
change the gameplay as much as I find
the rain slipping irritating yeah marine
slipping is very irritating weapon
braking is very irritating but
these are kind of like core gameplay
elements but oh but oh man that is that
is very tempting rich knows I disapprove
he also knows I'm not gonna go out of my
way to stop him I'm not gonna do more
than waggle my finger at him like he can
do what he wants he's a grown-ass adult
paid good money for the game I filled
the zero guilt
exactly exactly we go with I'm not I'm
not harsh on on anyone's vibe here we're
just we're just talking
I and you know what I hope you have fun
thank you I hope you have fun and I
guess that's are you gonna do are you
gonna mod for infinite durability I
probably won't do that but I thought
that would be so unique I was like very
curious how you would react to that cuz
that was your big complaint that it was
my big complaint and and like I said
actually a lot of that has been
mitigated my second playthrough because
I've learned so much from my first
playthrough where it's like I now know
how fighting enemies is really
unimportant and so I just you know I go
around I don't worry about weapon
durability though it still does bug me
every once in a while like if I haven't
really awesome happened I love it and
then it breaks or like the how how
breaking you know you get it like a
hammer and you're smashing rocks open
and they break all the time an axe to
cut down trees
did I ever owned a game genie for a
console item for the original NES it's
the only one I ever had might have had
one for like the Super Nintendo cute put
in a little code you get you know fast
play or infinite bullets or what yeah
that's cute I might have I don't know if
I used it much
three of sweet Goulding's bones and
spread them across the lake bring me her
bones this emulator mod is no different
than a game GP the the emulator mod
isn't my problem my problem is with
emulation in general though Oh mods I
have no problem with mods are great it
is how many mods do you get away from
the intended game yeah right then it's
like yeah you're having a single-player
game having fun
exactly no I have actually no problem
with any mods yeah whatsoever my problem
is with emulation in general and
obviously we've had so many
conversations about that we're not going
to deal with it right now but know my
mantra game away man I just thought that
might be the thing that the map man that
might be the thing that makes Jack pause
it definitely you know that it gives me
pause to think like ooh that was a big
problem I had to do
I Brown Adam Sandler I did see infinity
war with my kids we're not gonna we're
not gonna get too deep into infinity war
talk as obviously it's opening weekend
rich obviously saw it I also saw it we
won't spoil anything today no send you
to chat
no spoilers no joke spoilers no nothing
be cool its opening weekend we're not
talking about if Mike and you know what
my wife didn't get a chance to see it
but me and the kids went and if my kids
can be respectful of spoilers you can if
a goddamn ten and six-year-old can
handle spoilers soak in the chat
true-blue review yes I see your tip can
I spoil Justice League yeah Justice
League is out of the spoiler zone go
ahead yeah that's been out for a while
as someone who works for twit for twitch
moderation you overestimate the chat I'm
asking you to be to be on the same level
as a six-year-old
well that's asking for a lot but I
believe in you you can do it it's
opening weekend
it's opening you have a heart now am i
right maybe Wednesday maybe next week
we'll get into deep spoiler talk but
yeah for now just let it be overall I
thought it was pretty cute I got some
issues with it not too many I'm probably
gonna see it again mostly because my
wife didn't get to see it and she'll
watch the review the half in the bag
you'll know how I feel about bumping it
was a giant oh right yeah the half of
the bag is out you'll know exactly how
rich feels thank you jack
no problem get hack silver do either of
you have a favorite game in the favorite
character in this game mine is Mamere
the head yeah I like my mirror really
thought about it I'll you know Kratos is
funny he's a easy he's a fun care of
these are good Drax and this he's a bit
Drex in that really played for laughs
but yeah practical to a fault
one-pass didn't want to meet alone that
night
I like when creo says boy well then you
you'll have a lot to like in this game
he says that a lot actually I think
we're coming up on what might be what
might be my favorite location of the
game ice ice world oh yeah this is it
cuz cuz right now Ritchie you are on the
journey to get the tip of a chisel yeah
of a giant chisel okay that's what you
are on a journey to do and you need that
you need part of the tip of the chisel
in order to open special door my ability
to concentrate the story is gonna be
minimal tonight absolutely screaming no
but this is one of my favorite locations
and to see why in a little bit like
right there look at look at that that's
the Giant's hand you see like the
fingernail and like a ring ring like
that's neat a fucking big-ass dead giant
that you get to crawl around
yeah get it together
one nice nice Oh big with big whiff
Ridge let's see here true blue refuses
hey guys I literally just finished
watching Weird Al's UHF when your stream
started and I absolutely loved it thank
you for recommending it Jack I think it
would be a perfect perfect for a review
quite possibly I know I called it a
classic flash dream and rich disagreed
so at very least rich is wrong and we
know that so that would be a good start
to a review is how wrong which is
because UHF is absolutely a class all
right whatever
UHS UHF is an awesome movie and
hilarious I like I do wonder how it
holds up because some of the some of the
references were of their time yep but so
I don't know I don't know how a younger
generation would feel about UHF button
unit 603 idiots as rich is wrong well
there's the first time for everything
your kids watch you in UHF and they'd
say what's a librarian they know what a
library yes
banged out what I librarian is no they
would just wonder why Weird Al isn't
singing his songs because they they know
Weird Al their songs and they're like
when's he's gonna sing the song what's
the Conan
what's a book hey now what books is kids
know what books is settle down I know
what books is where would they know what
a book is because you know they go to
school and shit they read the books
they're giving them tablets well they
also have tablets but also books books
are still a thing
what's with the poor game audio you know
what I actually don't know and we've had
this issue before where the audio is
crackle II and I don't know why and we
haven't figured that out it might have
something to do with our Elgato Game
Capture card but it's also sending janky
audio to us and I'm sorry that you get
the janky audio but we can't really fix
it ah there it is look at that look at
that didn't they say earlier that the
frost giants weren't really giants but
he is a giant frost giant they did say
that the frost ranks weren't really
Giants but except for him who was real
giant and he's dead with a giant chisel
in his fucking hand and it's great
yeah yeah I did I have completed the
game I have finished the game on heaven
hundred percent of the game but I have
beat I finished the story and I was
hoping rich would have time to finish it
as well but I understand
another big review thing was happening
this week so as I'm liking the combat in
this check the combats the combat is
perfectly adequate rich it's cool it's
just adequate it's good this is not but
mission I'm sticking with that equipment
what you hit him in the butt with your
axe Ridge
oh you got it you got to get better at
that Perry this is the first time I've
run across these enemies and I'm not
familiar with the timings Jay I'm sure
Pat was taken I will discuss my full
feelings on the game when rich and I do
our full review and I don't want to get
too into it yet
I have many feelings on the game some
positive some negative some Mitylene
it's all over the place lots of talk
about I think it's it's good weighty
combat my actions feel deliberate you
know yeah I think there's more to it
than that
the whole thing it's a whole thing
Dark Matter says let me guess Jack hates
the unskipable cutscenesthat's nice
kappa cutscene it's a little deeper than
that dark matter yeah i think i think 10
out of 10 is going a bit far but I like
this game oh yeah I think anyone who did
a 10 out of 10
my there might be something wrong with
that person
Felix on Mars I don't know where your
Felix Omar says is it worth it
considering it's so short it's not short
it's not a short game the the story will
take you at least 20 hours and then
there's a bunch to do other than that
and I'm gonna be honest for an action
story that's a bit long for an action
adventure oh yeah I think for an action
game like 10 to 12 is actually a good
length and so yeah I don't know where
you're hearing that this game is short
because it is certainly not with all of
the side missions I could I if you were
gonna hundred percent it I guess you'd
get 40 or 50 hours that's a pure
estimate based off of the story that I
finished and a little bit of the side
missions that I've finished so
what does it say oh and you know what I
haven't played the new I know slay the
spire recently released their new
character and I haven't had a chance to
play I don't know 10 out of 10 is
equating this game to blood-borne which
seems ridiculous to me it is yes yeah
whoever whoever has given this game a 10
out of 10 you should raise an eyebrow -
and we talked about this a little bit
last time is is you know 10 out of 10
means perfect 10 out of 10 means there
is no problems whatsoever this is a
perfect game and you can say that about
so few games you can't say that about
amazing games so you know but if if that
is how a reviewer feels about it then
you know I guess that's our viewer feels
but like to say 10 out of 10 that's
weighty to me there are very few games I
would give a perfect score out of light
like I you know we talked about this
little last room where it like to me
portal portal 1 that's a 10 out of 10
that's an absolutely perfect game no I
couldn't find any flaws in that if I
tried everything about that game is
beautiful but even a game that I love
and I have at this point you know 150
hours into it like breath of the wild
there are some flaws to them you know
that's an 9 out of 10 8 out of 10 that's
almost perfect
you got stood for those guys you gots to
throw a thing at them that's a No
look around on the ground that's what
this blue no no no oh wait no oh that's
the red I'm looking at the glowy blue
part but I guess you have to I guess the
red things are in the way I know what
you mean um
so you gotta find I've done those before
yeah yeah oh there it is my I was going
straight to the blue part and I missed
that they were surrounded by the red the
red part yes yeah like this or breath of
what breath of the wild I like better
portal was like a three hour game yes a
perfect 3-hour game and after that
absolutely perfect game there's nothing
wrong with a short game right if it was
any longer they might have felt a need
to stretch out a segment too long or
might have overstayed its welcome or you
know had you retrace your steps or done
something to make it not perfect portal
is perfect every little bit of it every
short bit of it is perfect how quickly
can you beat Super Mario Brothers oh so
it can't be perfect
nope yeah don't shit your pants exactly
10 out of 10 perfect game very short
game some of my favorite games can be
beaten in like five hours oh yeah yeah
like mauricio 596 says to me short games
can can never be perfect that that
articulate yes
that's ridiculous if the experience only
lasts a couple hours but it's very
satisfying why why where do where do
gamers get in their head that something
needs to be X amount of hours because
some games are 40 hours right and so
that means they should all be 40 hours
exactly even though that's not
appropriate for every game that's like
saying every movie you know because most
movies are 90 minutes every movie must
be 90 minutes like that's an acceptable
average but sometimes they're longer
sometimes they're shorter sometimes a
movie isn't the right medium so we turn
it into a TV show and it's better and
it's five hours but over you know in
one-hour chunks and it's better that way
no every every narrative story in a
visual medium must be exactly 190
minutes exactly
is blood-borne a 10 out of 10 for me
might be it would be really hard for me
to think of a criticism for blood-borne
a thing a problem I had with it if not a
10 out of 10 you know 9 out of 10
definitely 10 out of 10 maybe I'd have
to give it some thought
jack is it possible you can like a game
that has some flaws more than a game
that has less flaws but the highest you
start is good is that not possible of
course it's possible of course that's
possible you can't get too caught up in
numbers yeah
well that's that's the whole problem
with the number system is you know for
for me and this is only speaking for me
because I know rich is about 2 is it
does disagree with me but I would give
something like Firewatch on an 8 out of
10 if I were yeah a number kind of
person but I would also give breath of
the wild an 8 or a 9 out of 10 obviously
those are two wildly different
experiences huh
but for me like if I were to break down
the numbers similarly that's probably
where they would end up but so wildly
different that you can't even compare
the numbers it's almost like it's a it's
a more complex situation than just a
simple number score yeah replayability
is a fact that you'd be entertaining
absolutely a game a game like the zone
of the enders 2 can be beaten in 5 hours
I've probably played through it like 10
times yeah yeah
but you know let every game is different
and so judging different things by
similar standards is it is a fool's
errand my friends
it's more complicated than than oh you
prick
then scores or numbers
oh that wind up is very satisfying when
you get that wind up perfectly and just
slice through someone with your axe yep
Mauricio says a masterpiece with flaws
is still a 10 out of 10 for me right and
to me that's insanity because 10 out of
10 means no flaws like 10 out of 10 is
no flaws and so you're saying a
masterpiece with claws is 10 out of 10
it's it's it's that logic doesn't sit
well with me but again numbers don't
necessarily sit well with me it's a bout
of minutiae of detail it's about context
dreamer take a no riches I don't know
well I'm looking
but there is no game with no flaws so
that logic doesn't make sense when
reviewing game says Red Ranger
agreed what's Tetris swamp what's
portals flaw
what but but that leads to my other
point of it doesn't make much sense to
review things with numbers
it's about it's about something greater
than numbers and there are games with no
flaws what's shadow of the classes is
gone
what's portal flaw was Tetris is flawed
what's the original Super Mario Brothers
for
what happened easier to do that me hey
Jack do you hate animes know I like
several animes I like several animes I
don't extensively watch a lot of animes
but I like like how do you feel about
portal 2 it's fine
I like portal 1 better for the two is
fine
not my favorite I didn't like I didn't
like a bit of portal 2 I thought while
the while the new like all the all the
new puzzle elements were cute it kind of
took away from the simplicity of the
first portal you know it added some took
away from the simplicity well yeah you
know the bouncy gel the the slippery gel
all that stuff is yeah it's cute but
more variation didn't necessarily do it
for me but it was fun I love potato
GLaDOS that was that was great that's
just fun that's just fun yeah it's fine
it was all fine not as not as perfect as
portal but still pretty good see that
that was a fun fight that's a fun fight
yes the the fights are fun I my my issue
to dip a little bit into review talk is
the fights are fun I think they're a
little too few and far between for my
taste and you have to put up with a lot
of malarkey in between your fights it's
a little trick my people can pull a
special way of not being seen
you can be invisible more like I can
step into the realm between rounds and
your mind doesn't understand what it's
seeing so it sees nothing at all that's
how we avoid ever having to actually use
the weapons we craft hmm
we can't hear the in-game sounds do you
hear anything in the game we can't go
too loud because when the battle starts
but you let him touch this again just go
up a little bit not too much
how about that is that better yeah cuz
we you know when the battle starts then
then it'll get nuts come on
I can hear just not when you're talking
that's how we want that's the point
that's exactly how we would like it to
be
dude dude thank you oh yeah Brown Adam
Sandler that is a little too spoilery
but that's very funny I got your tip
pretty amusing this one okay no spoil
spoiler spoiler spoiler as far as what
speak to you
it is somewhat awkward menu yeah and
that's but that's the best I can give
you on that don't spoil Jack for you
know I I've seen infinity war so if
you're gonna give me a tip to spoil it
that's fine but don't spoil it for the
chat hmm that's that's the important
part
don't spoil it for chat you need 24
smoldering embers where do I get
smoldering embers where do I get
smoldering embers there is a what do you
call it there is a vestigial world a
world in which you do not necessarily
need to go to that's like a burning
world and I believe you get smoldering
embers in the burning world because you
know there's there's there's there's
Midgard which we which we're in now yeah
there's the world you went to before
there's Jotunheim there's there's other
realms you can go to yeah to get shit
I don't think I was enough bang for the
buck for this one to be worth it
well it means neat looking though you
can't like them I like it I don't have
any member I know I know
boy don't even worry about think you can
think ahead oh sure without that one's
nice big big defense buff that's good
big cooldown buff yeah could be that
could be nice it'd be neat well they
seemed all-around worse some of them
some of them do
do-do-do-do-do let's see here i am matt
white says hey Jack and rich I have
finals next week and feel like the
weight of the world is crashing down on
me how do you deal with dress poorly I
can't I am of no help to you absolutely
of no help to you poorly I turn into a
quivering wreck of the yesterday fries
yes many many tears and you know myself
is I just take it a little bit at a time
I'm a friend if if you find yourself in
a situation where you when you're
overwhelmed just start breaking up the
overwhelming things into pieces and
tackle a little bit of your problem at a
time
okay in order to do this one big thing I
know I need to do all these little
things and then eventually you do a
couple little things and the momentum
starts to break it up into smaller bits
my friends
it's okay to do some things to better
your personal health a little meditation
time take 20 minutes of quiet time just
don't listen to music don't do anything
take some time to get inside your own
head has tried that that really helps me
when I get stressed out as you do like
three pages of free writing have you
ever heard of this it's it's a wonderful
weight you know all that crazy bullshit
that rattles around in the brain at all
times if I find myself getting really
stressed out like if I have a lot of
projects yeah what I'll do is I will
free write three pages which is just you
keep writing until you fill three pages
in a notebook then you love to paper
trail of your weaknesses you can't do
that well you can burn it afterwards but
the point is once you get them out of
your head and onto a piece of paper I
find that it relaxes just some I get it
yeah what well that didn't work how do
you get so that could be something that
is helpful
if george RR martin that tip with its
did you they he did a really great like
Q&A; with him and Stephen King recently
george RR martin and stephen king and
they had a funny little back and forth
about how stephen king just writes so
goddamn much in georgia or martin it's
just like what what the hell how do you
do that man it's like sometimes I'll
just look at a blank page and stare at
it all day and that'll be my day and
Stephen King's like just right who cares
if it's garbage just write it write it
out then I wrote a book while we were
having this conversation it's garbage
but it'll sell great and I wrote it but
the point is if you get stressed you got
it you have to find some way to deal
with it or it will eat you yes
fuck brother no brother no who cares if
it's garbage
Stephen King 2018 guess what my friends
that's a lot of the creative industry
you just got to do it you'd be surprised
how many bad movies have we watched over
the years rich how many bad movies have
you seen in a movie theater just do it
just make something and and you've done
it who cares if it's garbage
did you see Justice League someone made
that in fact that several people made
them oh this guy has wicked reach yeah
what difficulty setting that's what I
thought is the balance setting yeah a
fair challenge yeah don't let your
dreams be dreams that's right that's
right
just do it
just fucking do it but you waste your
time on garbage when you could be
productive well unless you're trying to
be unless you're trying to
professionally be a writer in which case
sometimes you got to just do some
garbage sometimes I just got a makeshift
this is the shield Perry does not work
on him I know you've been failing and
the shield Perry only works when it's
yellow if you see the red circle that's
something you can't pair and so you just
have to dodge the red circle but when
it's a yellow circle and can shield
Perry and you've just been missing it
but if you see a yellow circle it can be
Perry but you just have to hit the
timing see so that was red and you can't
yeah and that one I think he just missed
the time nice dodge nice dodge
was not exciting what yeah okay so Perry
knocks on the hall
well you've been slowly knocking around
we're off in the whole place hey writer
used to writes fail writes more than
write some more like anything you just
need practice is true like for for
anything in the creative field sometimes
you just have to put all the garbage out
there and then you just edit it later
but so I think a lot of people in the
creative industry get or who are trying
to get in the creative industry gets so
bogged down and making it a perfect
Hanoi from the get-go they forget to
just make things because it's not
perfect so why even write it down if
it's not perfect but you just got it you
got to write the garbage first and then
you make it you make it perfect later
who's the third man talking if you see
on Crate OSes belt here which can you
get a little closer move the camera
around see that dismembered head on
Kratos his belt that's the mirror and he
has joined us on this journey and he's
kind of our guide he's going to get us
into Hilton Heim but first there's much
shit we got to do first
first in order to get us to yard in
hyeme there's many things we have to do
if yours
but Mamere Mamere is is another is a
good always comic relief companion with
us did we sever his head we did on his
request rights Odin Odin had trapped him
in like a forever tree or something you
know something Nordic whatever and he he
had been trapped in a tree for hundreds
of years and so at his request we
removed his head and now he's just a
hell and my favorite part of that is
Kratos just refers to him as head like
he doesn't call him the mirror because
his head where we supposed to go yes
classic Kratos am i right he's fun he's
a fun character
Mamere burritos yeah practical to a
fault kratos is fun with these other
flavor characters like by himself he
probably a little bit much but there's
enough comic relief around him claim
that thing yeah
why are we going up and what we need is
all the way down there see yes boy head
woman I just leave smashing the ice
what how would want to turn the hammer
to Atlanta near the difficulty let's see
here
baba yaga Lalo says will there be any
spoiler talk of Avengers at the end of
the dream no no we won't even do a it's
spoiler time cut off thing today cuz
it's so fresh it just came out this
weekend maybe on Wednesday we'll do a
cut off time yeah but I mean even then
it's it's pretty fresh and and spoiler
alert there's stuff to spoil I have to
imagine though by Wednesday people who
are going to see this movie watch us
probably have probably have already
right so so my guess is like the second
half of Wednesday well we'll make a
cut-off point say now is the spoiler we
discuss
but not today no no spoiler talk today
and you as well in the chat no spoiler
talk not even jokes
Tom mcbowser trap says Jack so Jack does
a game with a parental relationship in
it appealed to you more because you're a
parent well he hates it so I'm gonna say
I mostly don't like it that's true I
like this I know yes yes rich mostly
like said I mostly do not like it here
here's my here's my joke about that
is uh the there is no in the game there
is no tell your son he did a good job
button
so that's Kratos but that's kind of the
story of the gifts even in Zelda there's
a pet your horse button and you get and
you you you you get a stronger
relationship build with your horse and
Zelda than you do in this game I'm not
gonna Pat my kid in the head he's a
barely adequate warrior he's in there
he's shooting arrows maybe if you patted
him on the head a little bit
he'd learn something instead of just
yelling at him Kratos has worked with
fifty other archers it would be better
for the job right because Kratos took
the time to train them and encourage
their murderous abilities
try that I missed something I'm barely
in the middle of a puzzle oh yeah you
might have needed to listen to him oh I
get to but something you might have
missed him say is it was written it was
written back winter okay
winter spring summer autumn that is also
true in Zelda there is no pet the dog at
the stable button which is a crime that
is a crime in Zelda that you can't pet
the dog rich is playing daddy issues
drink are we playing daddy issues
drinking game absolutely prepare to get
crunk at every point
but I guess I was kind of expecting I
was expecting a little something
gameplay involved with the bonding with
your son story whatever and and so as a
parent it didn't really resonate with me
because you know kid doesn't get better
as the game goes on yeah
but there you have very little to do
with that besides you beating up people
you beating up people gives you
experience to pass on to your son
so parenting no but you don't do
anything
I get experience in the end in the menu
you click that pass on to my son you
know but you don't do anything besides
click a button in the menu okay give me
a give me a encourage your son button oh
you and you're already 30 bullshit I do
i I'm sorry that I want gameplay and
story to have thematical elements that
work together it's an option not a
necessity today I'm trying to move the
art the other art form forward if you
want to beat things up and have fun yeah
that would work that would work too I'm
having fun beating things up or ago I am
fine with this
yeah that's a little preview of the
episode full episode we'll probably end
up filming later this week which needs
to get a little further well it's kind
of come what happens with the other
thing and by the early next oh sure sure
yeah well we'll get around to it there's
what I'm saying yeah we will make a God
of War episode
do I love that's my favorite that wind
up big two-handed x-wing very says not
shocked at all the very freedom
big whiff big win right there but what
I'm saying is there is a lot of this
game that is satisfying combat there's a
lot that works all I ask
yeah there's a lot that one so this
isn't a total failure as far as I'm
concerned and I'm coming down hard since
that story also rich you need to hurry
there's water coming
oh if you don't beat the bad guys fast
enough so I just got it I just got to be
the back if you don't beat them fast
enough for four classes
Jack one of my favorite things about God
of War was the spectacle boss fights
does this game have those it's got some
good boss fights um what do you mean by
spectacle the the big big boss fight
okay
the big boss fights that are sometimes
cutscenes sometimes they have some of
those yes I'm not as big on those but
they're certainly at least one Brown
Adam Sandler yes I'm sorry that you went
away from for a little bit but I did get
to your tip I didn't read it because I
thought it wasn't spoiler but it was
very funny I thought so
I don't I won't read your debt because
it's oily
yes turbo Dangerfield were early today
we we originally were going to film the
gotta for review episode today but rich
I wanted to get further riches and as
for a fur as as we'd like them to be
rich 10% more fur maybe 20% more for
well how far am I in the story you be
maybe I'm gonna say only halfway okay
I'm gonna say about halfway but you
might be like 3/5 maybe a little more
than halfway
oh look at that look at that then you
kick them right off the thing that's
awesome it's great yeah I'm getting
confirmation of people saying a little
over half or rippin fuckin hell
- punches
and the kid died in the fighting no the
the kid can never die he can be knocked
down which just means he's not available
to shoot arrows and the you know the kid
does a lot on his own shooting and
fighting bad guys but actually like like
what you just saw rich do is you can
actually point to things that you want
him to shoot and it's very helpful and
indecent in the fighting again like
especially with you especially those
dumbass witches where you really need to
shoot him a couple times to stun them
but you know the kids alright once you
get the kid leveled up a little bit and
he does more and you you can level up
his arrows and make his arrow stronger
it turns into a little badass he's out
there he's jumping around
he can call Egon summon beasts with his
arrows
how we feeling about the story is fine
it's a fine idea four-story fine idea
first story I think it's handled very
poorly which I can't get into for
spoilery reasons he wants to pet the kid
button i water that's a kid button why
can't i pat my kid on the head know
there's some other reasons too there's a
lot there's a lot of problems I have
with the story but just a little button
it's like hey wouldn't it be great if
like after a fight you could be like
good job you did adequate and maybe that
would affect like how the kid levels an
encouragement button what about what if
I don't like how he did then you say
that and that affects how he that's that
affects it all that's like a decision
you'd have to make as a parent and that
what if that would affect the gameplay
that'd be crazy
then that would be like theming story
with Jane pool and that would be a great
idea
stupid witches
a helicopter parent button right like if
you encouraged him too much
it maybe stuff what happened not enough
or in the wrong way or it would just be
different paths and it would just be
different depending on how you will
whereas parent or or how will you feel
Kratos would be as parent like you would
get to mold that wait
is there a Jackie's wrong button
absolutely absolutely
kid what are we doing
there's the jakka's wrong button
exclamation point Farscape
that's the jack is wrong button type
those buttons into chat and you get the
jack is wrong
oh also there's another one apparently
exclamation point Germany which says
when asking it for Jack's opinion on
something remember this he wasn't sure
if Germany was in the United Kingdom err
which that has very little to do with my
opinion that's just this geography are
you doing hitting guard instead of aim
Oh
well what I'm saying is geography and
knowledge of pop culture things are very
different you did well
the boy just having a little fun you big
jump there's like five commands about
Jack being wrong yeah yeah it happens
it's important to take things in stride
what is the last book I read the last
book I listened to as I've been
listening to more and more audiobooks
recently is is differently morphus the
new Yahtzee book the new Yahtzee
audiobook which is absolutely fantastic
yeah yes it's beautiful and recently I'm
starting to listen to in the completely
opposite direction I started we are
leaving there Bob but then got
distracted by a different audio book
called the color of law
yeah which is a nonfiction book about
the issue about the history of racial
segregation in city plowing that sounds
depressing it oh by the way horrifically
depressing but very interesting it's a
real downer you could have read a fun
book about space traffic yeah yeah it's
a real downer but but but also really
fascinating so that's me reading with my
ears I find that works better with my
schedule you know I can I can put on an
audio book and then like get my laundry
done do the dishes and stuff I can
multitask that way now let go and get
the chests nope
that's not an option it's not an option
to let go and go down and get the chest
cuz you could obviously get there easily
jump down there get the chest that is
not an option
you have to wait for the cutscene thing
to happen and then maybe you can get
down do you think one retains the
information the same way having read it
as long as you're paying attention
Zelda has ruined visible walls for
gaming oh my god right you just want to
climb in everything like I can't uh
there's there's no way I'd be able to
like you know I know rich does you do
this a lot were you like listen to stuff
while playing video game very frequently
and I can't do that I wouldn't be able
to retain any information but if I'm
doing the dishes that's that's a pretty
mindless activity and I can retain I can
listen to a book and for the long term
you know yeah I there's no way I could
do anything like play a video game and
listen to an audio book and still retain
the information so that's a really good
way to put it our avi Rossum says Kratos
is godhood is only limited by the game
design sometimes Kratos can do re strong
and amazing things yeah and sometimes
you just he can't jump sometimes he
can't do anything jumps you really
should of course do you think maybe rich
Evans is just so much better at this
game than Jack does a different scoring
of the game they're really they are
really hammering you there today rich
they're just out for blood
I mean I beat the game so it's not it's
not your day today Jack we're just we're
having an off day that's fine you know
what that's fine I have cake and ice
cream at home I'm gonna go home and eat
cake you get hammered for God for
opinions you you you just missed out on
an
an infinite durability weapons and Zelda
by emulation stance on emulation is all
wrong everything's terrible it's okay
we're all here having a good time
everybody's here
we're having a good time it's a lovely
day what a wonderful wall of ice okay I
guess we gotta keep nope
ship don't try to do anything clever
rich just do what the game wants you to
do with Jax stance on emulation I
generally don't care for it for several
reasons we go legality morality well
also super legality because we make
money off of these streams and so
emulating and streaming it's you know I
know no I don't know what Twitter's
policies are I would avoid it streaming
it yeah but seeing as I own is all the
breath of the world
I feel no guilt playing an emulated
version of it that's fine
ah script but the fuck is that there's a
wolf you get the wolf pack
yes both rich and I have seen the
Avengers I'm not gonna really talk about
it though because spoiler because it's
opening weekend but also apparently
though we don't really need to worry
about spoilers because according to box
office reports everyone has seen
anything fucking everyone has watched
this movie already as it has made
approximately all the money can I
counter this guy
yeah I'm gonna guess there's no good
counter for giant hunk of rock falling
on me we fucking throw mountains around
the crane houses godhood is very
dependent on I understand this
let's see here Edo kinetics hey guys
what would your top five boss fights in
blood-borne be would you rather see a
blood-borne prequel or sequel if you had
to choose that last one I really don't
care I'll be with whatever they want to
make I'm not a Laura more a lower whore
I just made that up I like it that's
from the dick punch him right in the
deck yeah whatever
game from software wants to make I'm
with them they've earned they've earned
enough credit in my book they get to do
what they want
top five bosses is a big ol I don't know
my friend
big ol I don't know why there's there's
so many boss fights that I loved and so
many is somebody that I hated but were
very rewarding to eventually beat and so
many that were just a big pain in the
ass I know everyone hates it but I
really like the Mikkel osh fight cage
head guy right the cage head guy yeah
you know running around the stairs and
then and then just you know ending in
the brawl in the room and I thought he
was he was he was spooky I don't know
where it rank that fight
listen good once the oh the king who is
the king of blood of cainhurst master
yes that's a fun fight
was the master of ligurius I don't know
llegará so yeah there's a mcGarry's
great yeah that like that that fight was
really boss I love that I like a good
duel with human-sized enemies yeah
that's fun one father gascoigne I mean
the shadows of the Armand yeah three
shadow snake guys oh yeah yeah yeah
those are cool really just just any to
me over the boss fights is just like any
new enemy you came across like a
normal-size enemy you know the first
time you come across an ogre it's the
biggest deal of my knowledge the first
time you come across the snake head guys
in the forest it's the most unnerving
every new and the bug-head enemies once
you get to the lake ah it's so weird
I loved all of them like you don't even
need I didn't even need the bosses I
could I could be satisfied with an
entire blood for clone with no bosses
just just weirdo enemies what difficulty
level is he playing on normal normal
people so obsessed about that and they
really are I don't I never understood
that this is uh I believe the developers
call it balanced but it's normal
because normal is easy these days no
this one hasn't easy
this one has a I'm just in it for the
story mode
until one of your finger
wouldn't that be nice
wouldn't that be nice of you yes the
game isn't perfect it doesn't allow you
do anything you could conceive that you
could possibly do Jack I'm I'm very
sorry that the game did not psychically
read your mind and realize I quickly
read your mom it's me right there rich I
came across that same situation I have a
note written about it which is why I
bring it up wanna I have many notes
about this game I have a specific note
about the fact that you have exploded
gems right there and a giant oak and a
giant frost ogre and you can't use the
exploding gems on the giant frost ogre
that four to ten yeah that's right what
I'd give it so rich lexis game more than
Jack yeah I think that's very safe to
say yes and maybe it didn't help that I
was coming right from breath of the wild
to this where you can do whatever die
yeah mister but that just seemed like a
thing that made sense to me like oh yeah
how fun they're giving us the exploding
things here
nope can't use them
pant can't pet your kid can't use the
exploded gems can't jump down to the
treasure that you should be able to for
out of time was I looking for more
exploration elements no no but like like
I said this sounds like exactly what you
were looking for though no well I I'm
saying a specific thing here is they
give you an exploding weapon that you
can't use during the flight you can't
use the exploding weapon for any fun
it's it's just a I was hoping for some
more gamey type things some more options
it's not necessarily exploration just
more gamey type things
I want I wanted I wanted to be able to
make some more choices it's not
necessarily about world exploration just
I wanted I wanted to need to make some
choices
can't you shoot the red crystal and make
it blow up I don't know if that would
affect the overall
gulpy this is a spoiler free zone for
infinity war please know infinity war
spoilers even if you are joking and
making up a joke spoiler we say none of
that because no one knows what is a joke
spoiler and what is not so no spoiler
whatsoever usually anything any spoiler
type things will result in at very least
a temporary chat ban we have I don't use
his stuff enough do you have the wolves
yep
I think so I recommend the wolves they
do a decent amount of damage and a
decent amount of stunned and it's it's
it's nice at least for it to start off
it stuns a bunch of enemies first one
you get if you're gonna be the weakest
it does pretty alright
and I feel about the are three finishers
you earned them I like them this the
whole stun mechanic stun damage versus
axe damage but the stun damaged heals
over time and it's more effective on
some enemies than others I like more of
a word for it it'd be nice if you got a
little bit of health regen but in
general I like the mechanic and some of
that some of the are three kills are fun
yeah yeah I I too would like a reward
I mean sometimes reward as you kill the
enemy for sure it's not always fatal
I'd love a doom esque if if you can pull
off one of those kills you get a little
bit of health or a little bit of a
Spartan rage build-up that would be nice
yeah yeah yeah if not health because
they don't wanna be too much like deal
might be fine at that increased Spartan
rage yeah yeah yeah
but yeah it's the
hey go nice nice deflecting
fuck it I'm punching you all
also that that's one of my favorite
movies when you do a big move and your
kid jumps off of your back and shoots
anymore
it's so bad
I didn't need extendable claws that's
there like that's it's almost like their
second form once you'd beat once you get
them down in enough health they grow the
claws so they're more dangerous so it's
it's actually nice it's like a second
form for a minor enemy and it really
makes you think about how much you want
to damage them or it adds a little bit
of a an oh shit moment where you see
their claws going they're like oh I have
to finish them quickly or else they will
hurt me more so it's actually a pretty
nice pretty nice little mechanic
chalk-white I don't fully hate the game
there are a lot of things I enjoy about
the game and the combat is one of the
things overall I do like the combat it I
have my issues with it but I love it and
it does not feel but mashie
it does not feel button-mashing but it's
good solid
combat I gotta think about what I'm
doing why I'm doing it and you know what
your ex is cool I'm putting this out
there
I love the hole for the axe but your
back to you it's cool there's a lot of
difference between going there in hand
and using the axe yep and you get those
cool moments where you throw your axe do
a little barehanded call your ass backs
back to you you almost wonder if they
were working on a on a prototype Thor
game because you know that's that makes
sense
that's me your and then they couldn't
get the rights or just didn't want to
deal with with dealing with Disney's
lawyers
or Disney not even anybody can use Thor
just can't be Marvel's version that's
right oh right
or if they put together a prototype to
sell to Marvel and Marvel wasn't buying
and I wasn't sony's like oh those the
Kratos in there I'll pay for it I was
fully expecting y'all near to be an
unlockable weapon in this I'm assuming
it's not as you have said nothing about
it if it is it is it's not anything I've
come back okay and you beat the game
Bobby the store something like that
would be part of the story yeah
not even Disney can patent ancient
mythology yeah you never know man
well they're two they're two strokes
away all right in ancient mythology this
Thor's hammer always come back to his
hand yeah or is that something Marvel
can patent right or could they at least
argue it and they have the money and
lawyers to where sure right now you're
talking all the things people are saying
they think it does in mythology don't
they okay came back so they can totally
do that then I don't know much else
going on right now
the travelers Oh disgusting smelly
covered in God knows how many little
beasties but gorgeous armor let's see if
I can't make something more sanitary yes
oh the dwarves once you retrieve the
whetstone please take class of handling
isn't me old near the Spartan armor in
hello I don't know the old near I think
I'm pronouncing it correctly is Thor's
hammer think they named the armor in
halo after it oh there you go
what are they saying they're saying he's
metal oh yeah no it's named after Thor
Thor near yeah you ol near yep
Mew Mew Mew that's always my preferred
pronunciation Mew Mew
it's a mythological thing and halo did
not invent the name I neither did dizzy
no they didn't you could you you could
have your own wheel near in a game oh
yeah but just to be safe we're not gonna
I don't I don't think alright if they
did start developing this as a game
about Thor not Marvel's Thor but just
mythological Thor yeah it's not
necessarily Marvel that scared them off
it's like we could we could attach this
Thor idea to this God of War franchise
which is popular right right and we get
mad money that way it could've just been
that oh yeah I know in in my in my head
Canon which I'm sure is not true at all
the original intent the original intent
was to sell the game to Disney like hey
we can't we can hook this up with your
Thor franchise and and that's that's an
income for us and since that didn't work
they took second best which is selling
it to Sony which is why God of War has a
hammer or has a an axe that returns to
him also it's very possible that this
was a God of War game from the beginning
I don't know yeah and I honestly just
don't care look it's a neat axe
I love that you can throw it and it
comes back to you I think it's neat
beef thirst says Jack please stop saying
Mjolnir it's physically painful to
listen to how do you pronounce it
properly the beef thirst I will try to
stop saying mule near so often and I'm
sorry that my pronunciation of Mjolnir
offends your eardrum and its proper
pronunciation just keep fucking saying
it I was planning on keeping on saying
mule near no matter what because I get
to do what I want
I got a mic in front of me me own ear
once you retrieve the Winstone mule deer
ooh I like mule deer baby does he have a
guy's head on his belt yes that's Mamere
he talks and he talks Tia and he's his
life he's helping us find our way to
Jotunheim the land of the ice giants so
we can spread our dead wife's ashes on
the tallest mountain in all the realms
cray doses new dead wife as opposed to
his last dead wife that's a really
important distinction because he also
has a new kid very distinct from his old
kids who is dead well this is his live
kid this is his live kid also his new
kid right
Surinder
the old format the man said no this
fight is mine boy go
I think we've been introduced to these
characters before these are Thor's sons
otherwise known as Stephen Harold yes
are these Natalie Portman's kids or yes
Thor and Jane Foster finally had choice
and begetting agnya that's why they're
so pretty look at him
dizzi Deb no it's not it's not a plot
device it's it's the plot motivation to
have you take the wife's ashes today
that's the it's not I mean I guess it's
a plot device but it's also just the
plot it's the kicking off point to our
story of a father and son rebuilding
their relationship
taking a
a real-life journey but also a journey
development okay okay I get it doesn't
need
well look and there are convenient plot
devices in the story there there's a lot
of there's a lot of you need a thing to
get to where you're going bring the
thing back to where you are now oh wait
eating another thing there so there are
that but but generally taking your
wife's ashes are not a it's just a
that's the boning
if I were Thor I'd get a paternity test
blonde and red-haired sons one you know
genetics can that's that can be a gamble
- you know he's a god so it's all it's
all crazy you she washes stuff well is
mythological Thor even blond great
question or if we have we been so
indoctrinated with Chris Hemsworth the
greatest of the heavens that that we
just think that's how I assumed thought
it's a blonde because he's North in a
Norse God but
also though like it's all messed up I
have some friends they have three
children one blonde one brunette one red
and just genetics are messed up
my mother I thought him both left-handed
your mother and father are both
left-handed now if you look at me you
know they don't know my mother or father
I look very much like both of them okay
there's no shenanigans going on there
but I am right-handed which shouldn't be
possible is that how that works
yes interesting
because no I look just like that so no
shenanigans yes I highly doubt it
there's just too damn much of my father
and shit
your face trying to wail your digits
which his love of baseball forced to
mention quite fabulous baseball
predominantly right well everything's
that predominantly right-handed
everything because people one of them's
just ambidextrous dizzy death says I'm
not ragging on the story just an
observation about how most video games
still just use MacGuffins too much I I
don't think the mother's ashes can be
considered a MacGuffin as they are
integral to the story that the game is
trying to tell like a MacGuffin is
something that can be replaced with
anything and I'm a guy wants the
diamonds the bad guy wants the microfilm
the bad guy wants them and it doesn't
change the pot at all exactly but this
is a story of you know parents and
children and so I don't think the
mothers assets
considered a MacGuffin okay whatever
he's doing I don't like
that's right axe man 808 says avatar
used the literal unobtainium rough right
in that story unobtainium could be
replaced with any thing
mr. glyph says okay Kratos wants to take
his dead wife's wisdom teeth to toss
mountains same case I don't know if
you're trying to be funny but the point
is the dead wife it's the dealing with
the dead wife that's integral to the
story so even if you were taking the
dead wives sword to the top of the
mountain in remembrance of her
it's the dead wife part of it not the
ashes part of that makes it
all right let's see here
gobbledygook says so I've decided to
study artificial intelligence
it's my new purpose in life how would
you describe the AI in this game most
importantly how is the AI of your sole
companion does he ever do anything
stupid he's lost every now and then have
you had any good that I mean I've had
him like stuck somewhere else in the map
yeah he's gotten stuck on me a few times
to where I've had to actually like
restart from my last say I'd say it's
pretty pretty basic AI knowing very
little about AI I'd say it's pretty
basic I think you can reflect that back
to
nothing you know there's no light like
we said there's no like infighting
between monsters there's no there's no
goofy monster stuff they all just kind
of attack you and leave each other alone
is done
milk started
that was a silly little animation psycho
where he he was just taking your ax it's
not doing much but now you know the kid
does a pretty decent job on his own like
taking care of enemies doing shit
I can't remember
fuck you
that was close rich you did it
you came really close chad is reminding
you to use your arrows more don't forget
about and you know you have the balls to
or whatever it was
the arrows don't seem all that effective
on these guns maybe I'll switch to your
Billy arrows because I think that might
yeah and don't forget about your animal
for helpful friends experience
gobbledygook says the new transformers
power of the primes this season premiere
is this Monday on machinima Ron Perelman
Judd Nelson will in Wheaton and Mark
Hamill are lending their voices most
things I'm looking most thing I'm
looking forward looking towards some
form of power of the plan I'm happy for
you but I haven't I haven't given much
of your shit about transformers in 30
years
is this a new car I assume a new cartoon
there's Bulls a trip well rich rich has
the boars right now I like the Wolves
just because they do decent regular
damage and stun damage you know they all
have their pros and cons
which do you have you have a healing
stone and and don't forget about your
like your two power stones
there you go now that that hit him for
20 nice see that's fun calling your ex
back and seven smack people on the way
back to you that's such a poor thing
is this supposed to be Ornstein and
smoke its Magni and Modi Thor's kids I
don't know how accurate that is to Norse
mythology
but that's what we got Magne and Modi
get a bridge
window
oh it's accurate that's spirit
all right kid I finally like you oh no
where it's the sickness you got too
worked up boy why didn't he do that at
the start of the fight because they they
were stronger
they'd beat him down and he's able to
stick his fucking axe in their face I'm
fine
keep an eye on him you weren't a trophy
you did it that did what you do you're
the trophy so how is this kid even alive
after that kind of battle remember that
Kratos is the fucking god of war and so
his kid is also a God anyone like one
quarter gone at this point well Kratos
is full guys then the kid would be half
full God Kratos is the full God of War
you didn't you didn't finish playing the
God of War game Oh God at the end of God
of War after you defeat Ares God of War
you become the god of war right yeah so
you're full he's fuckin was Kratos his
mother or God or was crate as his mother
oh yeah morning oh I think in one of the
later games we find out that his dad was
a God but his mother I don't when he's a
god man sure sure God into your name get
you where you need to go he's full God
and we don't and we don't know anything
about the mom can now be unlocked right
I didn't I never play the original games
I don't know what we know about Thor's
mother Kratos his mother Kratos his
mother yesterday
how can create OHS be a god at this
point didn't he lose all of his powers
at the end of God of War 3 I that I
don't know I've only played the first
guy but in timey-wimey man it doesn't
matter of it matters
he's got or not a god sometimes he has
problems jumpin
