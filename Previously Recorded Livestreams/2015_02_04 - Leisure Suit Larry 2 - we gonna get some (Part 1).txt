that was terrifying
oh my god our own ad nearly deafened me
worse I was in TV playing the the sound
is that we're like it shouldn't be
what's coming the video I guess my
graphics card is able to handle sound
for when you plug it into a TV it's nice
let's say to see mine I never hear sound
on my own TV at home
I don't know any the remote we're trying
to sound out on TV cuz that's gonna
happen again

- huh dads
yeah we have to suffer through ads um if
we want to watch this dream also who
would linked us to a woman is afraid of
owls that was the dumbest SNL sketch
I've ever seen that was really awful you
know sometimes there's that setup where
you know what the punchline is gonna be
but it still catches you by surprise
yeah I mean when the joke is only
somebody just kind of losing their shit
running around and breaking things and
tripping over the oh that's the function
Oh Oh like oh sure that's great I loved

also professor pun thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it because it's
definitely clicked as bang on that's not
shown up it's not shown up why is it not

like a 30-second delay in my headphones
yeah I'm excited for the game to start
so I can just do an audio testing Oh
asshole thank you for subscribing for

Suit Larry - right and Darth meringue
geez dark place thank you for
subscribing
we very much appreciate it and I also
enjoyed Darth meringue geez Garth
Maggie's dark place um you see that one
ah our Crime $29.99 thank you for
subscribing
we really appreciate it it's true we
very much do hey this is Leisure Suit
Larry - yeah we're it's an adventure
game we are playing it because it is I
believe the only classic Sierra parser
adventure game that I haven't played and
parser is is different from the
point-and-click I actually have to type
in what your character does I assumed
this was a point-and-click and it is not
no it is a parser which using context
clues means that you type yes you like
you still use the arrow keys to move
around but like if you want to search
the cabinet you type in search cabinet
and then if you want to use an item you
have to actually describe what you do
with it you don't just like click
randomly on the screen until something
happens love it you have to think about
how you use the things you have I enter
odd you love that also Questor fest
thank you for subscribing these past
four months
so okay now because this is an old game
yeah this is this is ancient DRM yes see
back in the day they could not stop you
from just handing your copy of a game to
a friend and letting them install it and
then giving you the discs back and one
person could buy the game and twenty
people in the neighborhood could have it
right you couldn't I don't know if it
was hard to share it over the internet
back then but there was still piracy yes
so while the the actual copies of the
game were easy to make and pass around
hmm they figured the hand books were a
little bit more difficult to duplicate
yes so what they did was they they had
like information that you had to verify
in the handbook before the game would
start so so we have like a little PDF
file that I I generally I bought this
off of GOG calm how strange
yes this is a other than this handbook
DRM this is a a DRM free game that I
have bought off of Gog and it comes with
a PDF file that's got the old manual so
I'm looking at PDF file of a pages from
the book where it's got pictures of
different girls and their phone numbers
and what is her number seven four four
eight seven four four if I need to click
in the window right bingo
okay okay also yeah Oh give him four
four get the mouse out of there H damn
mom will give me a second jack and mouse
out of there well that's actually kind
of part of the game too you might be
able to click on things here in there oh
it's it's like this they're starting
when they made this they're starting to
move towards play sure sure so there is
some point and click functionality great
all right we're starting
Leisure Suit Larry goes looking for love
animist primal thank you for subscribing
in several wrong places and I'll just
get through a little okay
and several wrong way is animist primal

happening here did Larry just fall off
of his own Croats I think he fell Teddy

saw on out of the corner of my eye it
looked like Larry took a header that's
titled I would believe that this is what
are all these balls delightful you make
any sense
what are these balls
I don't think we're hearing the game
music in the stream well we are not
hearing the game music extreme oh well
well maybe it's just something you have
to cook it'll be okay sorry everybody a
rich doesn't want to figure it out yet

hot tub in lost wages in your luxury
penthouse apartment in the land of first
game okay at the end of the game
remember big finale

here well I are that is you stammer why

calendar if you guys miss something that
is a game-ending fuckup
do you want us to tell you is what the
chat is asking I mean if it's a
game-ending fuckup
what do you think what do you think rich
we made it through I think I think save
frequently I made it through Space Quest
yeah it took a couple days but I knew
about game-ending fuck-ups though I
think I steered away you Stevie like
like for example if anyone was was here
for the Space Quest adventure I got
really stuck at a couple times like I
got really stuck in the ship yeah so if
there's something that we are super
stuck on um then let us know that is
what I was saying all right all right
I mean well and we'll tell you guys will
say you guys tell us you know what's
going up sir apparently I can't spell
calendar look Kel and dirty ale see ya
Yin D yeah I think it's a are you think
they are oh nothing look up okay
there's a mirror you want to look at
more the mirror but it might say
something insulting I don't think we
were spelled with an O is it least not
there you see a barbershop
haha okay that's kind of clever
okay it looks like we are back up
streaming sure yes we are back we are

question how much did you guys miss oh

to the computer so that's our bad one -
how much did you guys miss the mirror
and the barbershop joke oh did you you
saw the backwards Burger ship okay great
well then we just left the barbershop
and now we are in the slightly seedy
section of the city by the seashore
possibly he's true it's what she sells
okay Jay is working and so I have his
mic down at the time but if he wants to
say anything I will turn up his
microphone and he will talk to you but
let the man work I'm doing visual
effects
say that again Jay I'm doing visual
effects there you go six hours some
three seconds of the movie
that's how movies working yeah here's my
piece of advice for aspiring filmmakers
yeah don't make a movie that has visual
effects in every shot of your film
unless you're George Lucas don't do it
great weight avoid sprawling science
fiction epics let's go get somebody else
oh yeah if you have a team of like
seventy-five to a hundred visual
sardis then I would say go for it what
what movie was that we were watching and
we got to the end credits and the visual
effects it was like some brick of text
like the whole screen was metal that's
every movie now especially Marvel it was
a Marvel movie I know but well they're
all like that and in the Iron Man 3
there was joke could be effects artists
joke 1 yeah like they they put in extra
ones oh really
maybe it was Iron Men through them
that'll fuck with people it's it's been
numerous movies now yeah and now you
understand why because you've been
trying to do them all yourself
yep great I mean I understood why before
but it was fun to make fun of them now
doesn't seem is money sure okay alright
we are now in a slightly seedy section
of the city welcome we find her
I don't know ah there oh this way I
think was the studio so I'm gonna walk

it's just humping I'm sure it is just
humping and every time you thrust the
dog barks yeah it'sit's pretty surreal
yeah it's too sad for me to find funny
yes it's because it says you're just
watching a guy who's clearly mentally
ill you know desperate for attention as
I love Randy Quaid we've made fun of
Randy Quaid but it's it's yeah it's kind
of sad yeah yeah and the less attention
you give it the better yes that being
said I understand completely why people
are fascinated by it hundred so we used
our last dollar okay so we don't need
that last dollar for something in here
right
like I'm never quite sure when I okay

generalization I don't like it um I
