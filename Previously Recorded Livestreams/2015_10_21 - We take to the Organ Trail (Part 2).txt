key is right for your future future Jay
okay okay so now we gave away the steam

to enough to get can lose that that's
crap man I'm sorry okay so here we have
a ps4 version of Oregon Trail and let's
see what's the what's the next trivia
question they made scavenging a lot
harder yeah yeah oh
nice gotta shoot those before they
become an issue
Jack sticks I like that there's no way a
ps4 could run this game you have to turn
down the graphical settings a little bit
in order to run it on your ps4 yeah yeah
see I before they did some major updates
like last time we stream this yeah it
wasn't that shape yeah I got there
pretty easily just by scavenging
frequently oh sure that's why you want
him to start on suicide because you
thought it might be a little too easy

another trivia question I got nothing
I'm in the middle of car fixing Jack
rich has nothing nothing give me give me

favorite scene from the Back to the
Future trilogy one special one just
think of a moment in the Back to the
Future trilogy that you really enjoyed I
I liked a lot of a lot of the weird
future stuff in Back to the Future - you
know like um who was it that was like
floating upside down because they heard
their back was that George yeah I
thought that was hilarious
I remember thinking about exactly how
could they have known rich if once we
get to floating upside down technology
your back is gonna be fine
yeah fake Crispin Glover that's right
that was fake Crispin Glover
you know what I don't think there is a
worse back because you like Back to the
Future 3 is obviously weird and it's you
know it's just them like farting around
and making a Western but I still think
it's enjoyable I think it's you know
even back I think even Back to the
Future 2 is weird
listen the best back to the future is
back to the future everyone knows that
part 2 is a little confusing a little
convoluted oh my god you need a med kit
do not have Medicaid
and back to the future is the best is
the best to the future that's funny and
no I don't I think it's interesting
because it's so different than the first
one yeah I give them full credit from
being slightly risky with it they didn't
just remake the first one which is kind
of what the third one is I mean it's in
the West not the fifties but beat for
beat the plot feels similar to the first
sure sure just trying to get this in the
past don't have the right fuel stars so
we need to do a special thing with this
train so we get up to 88 miles per hour
we got to fix the emotional problem
before we have the action similarities
you know what I never thought about it
like that
oh I didn't that's fine
you can do it
you knew this
fuck you I hate this part
oh yeah that's funny stick Lords what's
your name
Clint Eastwood what kind of stupid name
is that we need everything we need fuel
a few old auto shop okay yeah we need
repairs more than anything perfect
thoughts on Michael J Fox for what we
need $38 for one no I mean he I enjoyed
Michael J Fox and the things I've seen
him in I know you know I have no more or
less information than that
I'm Michael J Fox what are you thoughts
oh my god a fox
yeah you're doing great rich you're sure
talking about Michael J Fox oh he was
also doc Hollywood
remember that doc Hollywood you like
it's been so long since I've seen doc
Hollywood I don't remember it being
terribly good but you know it's fine
whatever that's fine that's fine
not Doc Holliday doc Hollywood or a fox
yeah we're all kinds of fact great
what do you why do you need money fuel
fuel do we need fuel yes
did you did we learn how to scavenge in
town yeah great Oh big old bag of money
they go bag of food hobo Oh zombie ate
another hobo that's great I took care of
that hobo for you I mean I guess we're
all hobos Oh screamer $25 any more than
that okay
is that enough I don't know I don't know
how much you need what do you want to
buy I need to $4 you need $4 they have a
hundred food ten for a buck
there's all the fuel lemonade nice nice
wait you're selling your fuel well oh
okay well move slowly but you don't need
med kits that was risk sure that was big
risk sure sure
what supplies and carry capacity not
only that decent supplies and GPS Bajor
city decent supplies GPS I don't know
what a GPS is but as I am you must cross
a horde of zombies it appears to be
docile you have the cowcatcher
they're docile man docile
right there right through cowcatcher
do-do-do-do-do you get caught in a
blizzard the cold will tax your health
and well you'll have to drive more
cautiously I like how it's like everyone
blames me even Tiberius Kirk he's like
yep that was me that was absolutely me I
lost it my bad
no my kids have not seen Back to the
Future yet you get you got very tired
losing that battery like he had to lose
it out in the woods
really so we got a little tired you got
a little tired man I have the greatest I
have the greatest app on my phone and
it's called kids media and it tells you
all the swear words and every movie ever
made
yeah and I'm gonna look up Back to the
Future right now let's see let's check
out the language zombie activity load
you wanna try scavenger you're 5 ammo
yeah sure why not
why the fuck not ok so here's what this
app tells you about Back to the Future I
love this is why I love this app
occasional swearing includes damn
butt-head shit ass asshole son of a
bitch hell bastards and Jesus Christ as
an exclamation
where the the app I think has slight
religious overtones in the 1950s it
seems a few racial epithets epic
epithets are used and the bad guy by the
bad guys including Irish bug and spook
and a mayor is referred to as colored
these are all the things about back to
the future
that's crap tents crap oh that's great
you needed that and you said my food
yeah all right epithet yeah I know
that's a tough word for me to say I put
that epithet so but overall you know
they give it a positive rating they say
9 and up a lot of cuss words so that you
know my boys probably won't be watching
it anytime soon but yeah eventually
they'll see it that's one that kids need
to see I think
I know oh yeah you know that's a good
meet Packard attempted rape equals safer
children if they say Jesus though you're
on the app I wonder if they talk about
the attempted rape hold on maybe that's
in the VAT there's a violence section in
an early scene an attack by a squad of
terrorists includes automatic weapon
fire and what appears to be a
significant fatal shooting I love this
app other sequences include suspenseful
car and skateboard chases a character
threatened by a shotgun some perilous
scenes involving a tall clock tower and
punches thrown between high school kids
bullying a significant theme occurs on
numerous occasion the bully initiates an
exaggerated off-camera assault on a high
school girl but she's never really in
danger when he tries to rape her she's
never really in danger
yeah suspenseful skateboard chase yeah
the rape attempt he's really strong but
they they're passing that off as it is
she's never really in danger I love this
oh wait no way there is a sex category
to let's see here
in the sex department a few kisses and
embraces some flirting teenage crushes
are a key part of the story with hero
Marty becoming the object of affection
of a girl who will grow up to become his
mother while perched in a tree a boy
spies through a girl's window
mr. quenches measles Oh mr. glitch gets
around what's this new bar radiations
Oh a bad choice you went into the
radiation this bad oh sure if you ever
want to have a good laugh get yourself
this kids media app I love it I play a
game with my wife sometimes where we
just like list off all of the stuff it
says wrong and we try to guess the movie
that's - one of my favorites that's
great do another okay should we do that
should we do that should we play a game
this is all this is what I should have
done to give away the keys play guess
the game from the kids media you know
what we'll just do that as a string Jay
oh you know what Jay has a bunch of DVDs
to give away he says he has a bunch of
old movies that he's either like bought
on blu-ray or doesn't watch anymore and
he wants to do like a mega giveaway
right so what we'll do is we'll find
their information on the kids media app
and then see if people can guess them in
whoever guesses it right gets it that's
how we'll do it
this game it'll be great
good kid what are you just gone out what
are you going on there was nothing there

from Dave's office okay okay so we are
playing guess the movie based off of
what the kids media app has to say about
it and if you can guess the movie
correctly you can win a steam key for
Oregon Trail and I'm so excited about
this game and here's the thing because I
know a lot of you will just want to
guess anyway and if you if you already
own the game or don't have steam that's
fine

in the fucking head
nice nice okay we have steam keys let me
open up the kids media app okay we
aren't subscriber on the mode here is
what here's what it's happening I'm
going to list off how the kids media app
describes a movie and you have to guess
the movie also subs if you could turn us
into you only get one guess per minute
but can you put the room into slow mode
because you only you only get one minute
so here's what am I gonna say wait I'm
gonna I'll wait till the room gets
turned into slow mode alright it's gonna
be great it's gonna be great
nice okay here we go ready here's how
they describe the language of this movie
no strong language is clearly heard but
much of the dialogue is obscured by the
thundering
sound effects who knows Oh No
so that's how they that's how they
describe the language here's how they
describe the violence intense constant
violence of all kinds including against
women characters die in explosions and
car crashes and are shot and stabbed
with arrows a pregnant woman dies the
dead baby is cut from her womb mostly
off screen fighting chasing nightmare
sequences flashbacks disturbing imaged
diseased flesh blood transfusions did
you figure it out yeah it only works
during the day oh sure oh there we go
and chaos
14:28 gets it with Mad Max fury road Mad
Max fury road that was the first one I
wanted to try it out so uh chaos I will
be sending you that steam key in just a
moment we'll just so we'll get another
one do you have an idea for a movie you
can type it in
engrossed in this okay okay so a little
okay so now we're gonna go a little less
recent how about this I'll give you the
let's see here what about okay type on
this this is yeah it's it's okay so this
movie I'll give you the decade this
movie is from the 90s okay that's
that'll be my one hint you know I think
this room is now somewhere okay so here
is this movie we will start with the
language this is what kids media app has
to say about this movie
it says profanity and cursing is
pervasive throughout fuck in all forms
is used in nearly every scene there are
also several ethnic slurs uttered
including the n-word and ugly references
to Jews actually they don't get very
specific in that one let's see if the
violence can help you guys out from
start to finish

positive messages no this movie is about
a moral unethical and illegal behavior

almost all cases they show no guilt or
remorse there's a movie I love this I
call a picture film rot rot
hold on Maul rattle and chaos for know

be an interesting one oh I know I know

the room is now in slow mode so are we
ready
this movie is from is that right
2002 well that's what the app says let's
start with language because that's
that's always a fun place to start with
hmm a few instances of shit said by the
kids lots of name-calling and low-level
swearing crap but jerk idiot and other
colorful insults let's take a look at
violence oh that's too specific we can't
go there let's see here let's look at
sex
is there any sex the boys google teenage
girls and the camera lingers on the
female anatomy one of the boys tricks a
lifeguard into kissing him they go spike
1382 gets it with the sandlots nice one
spike 1382 oh yeah as soon as you guys
got the kissing one you guys got all
that I was giving a little bit away with
the kids but spike 1382
nice Oh where'd it go where'd it go
according to the app it says 2002 the
Sandlot that's well then the app has it
wrong I have many apologies I was just
going by what it says on the app Sandlot
- I'm looking the Sandlot beside the
Sandlot - was 2010 oh well then the app
has a typo on it okay
many apologies for everyone who's
looking at 2002 movies button
many many pounds I thought it was
earlier than that 93 the the moral of
the story doc trust everything you read
is don't trust everything you read on an
amp but it's still it's a hilarious app
I always like look up movies and to see
what they say about it like like like in
that one they say but no redeeming value
none let's see what they have to say
about the same line hold on
positive messages in the sandlot
positive messages about friendship and
loyalty family relationships are more
complex but characters intent is
generally good that's true that's true
let's see here
do they have positive role models the
kids are typical preteen boys shut up
but face quantifies as Riddhi witty
rejoinder but they clearly care about
one another when it counts even though
the film is set in 1962 some parents
will question the way girls are
portrayed the way they were supposed to
be right 1962 maybe that maybe they
portrayed them a little too evenly for
1960 there was one girl who wasn't in
the kitchen she had an opinion there was
a woman and she was wearing pants you
won't believe it
