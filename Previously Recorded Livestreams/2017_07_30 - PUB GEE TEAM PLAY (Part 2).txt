okay
Texas panhandler says I bet $3 that
you'd both be dead before the alive
count hit 50 grats boys you made the top
50% I made her lose here's you I guess
one of my issues with this game I've
made top 5 twice really that's great
I barely saw a soul yeah
that's the real issue the real issue of
the game is there there is skill you
know aiming your shots tactically moving
around there is tactics both of those
both skill and tactics can be superseded
by dumb luck are we are we ready to move
on are we oh yeah we go again yeah are
we caught up on just that was it good so
yeah both get both can be superseded by
dumb luck which is just one of those
things where yeah if you happen to land
in the middle of the circle you can
fucking take your time most of my
gameplay footage
excuse me ugly / most of my gameplay
footage is me being in the middle of the
circle finding some decent items and
then hiding in a bush for 20 minutes and
then you know someone will walk by me in
the bush I'll shoot him I'll loot their
stuff go back in the bush cuz I'm in the
circle you don't have to move any plans
to group with viewers for pub games I
don't know like right now listen we're
barely handling two-player at the moment

looking for anything
we got bombs we're in a house there's a
little muzzle other shotguns joke I got
I got two good guns I'm happy with you
some more ammo a cave what does it take
it's a seven point seven two six two six
I just dropped some of that actually I
want some five two millimeter why did I
just drop some that because I didn't
have anything
could've been one house over
if see if I spot anyone flailing we have
plan ah no no we don't we're hanging out
here until we have to move no we should
start moving forward let's head I put on
the map inside the circle there's like a
tiny at northeast of us there's a tiny
little northeast this way oh yeah seven
oh you're both 9 million everyone if we
come across a 45 handgun am i someone
shoot you never know it could be by the
pond or the town over there
that's head let's head north east oh
yeah all these trees nice cover it's the
element
plenty of bushes you know and you know
why I have a bad habit of pointing my
reticle at the ground is is because
sometimes it gets in my way like the
white distracts me and so I pointed at
the ground just to see everything better
and I know I need to get better at just
pointing it at whatever I'm looking at
just in case I want to shoot at whatever
I'm looking at I know that is a really
bad habit of mine and you know what I
will try to get better at that but like
you know if you if if I'm pointing up
there my body blocks some of the view so
if I point down a little bit I can see
more of the terrain you dig but I do
understand that that is it bad that is a
bad gaming habit of mind
shit
well I'm gonna check this there's an
east side of the hill here see if I see
anybody
just at night you know what that is rich
has a nice feast it's like we're heading
towards that radio tower what's getting
into crazy car chases maybe we'll find a
car rich fun
maybe we'll find a car the action is a
little too far too few between I think
that's the point
I really think that's the point
oh really let's get the house get ready
for a fire fight
so another door
thank you nice
what
if you could watch myself
oh there's seven six two in here we got
a guy in the area I'm not worried about
that right now okay there's a nice
helmet here oh okay
we got a guy in the area we also have
bombs going off yeah no all right I got
these two windows covered as soon as
bombs stop going off we got a my guess
is maybe the other guys by the car yeah
it's about just a normal bomb just a
normal box I don't know if anyone else
is here unless he's on the other side of
the car
all right I'm opening the door let's
storm that fucking car okay I'll go to
the back you go to the front I'm in the
car just get in the car just get the car
let's go let's go
let's partner my debt all right
the bombs going it could be great
we don't have one bomb luck here anyway
well you know we have this circle luck
so if we got shit bomb pluck and big
circle like I'll take it
nice stop by a rock you just cover you
know like I don't like being I don't
like being a loud target
you see no it's just do you see this
like gun glitch in my on my screen oh

person let's try different I don't see
anybody moving rich I don't see anybody

of them yeah you got one of them whoo
rich the bullet magnet Evans
whoo well that was exciting that was
Bunker exciting oh it's too bad
the enemy got you rich the enemy gotcha
I legitimately am really sorry for
shooting I was fine it's a fantastic
stream moment I got so spooked that I
saw someone I cuz Jack well you know
what but he was mostly healed after I
shot him and then we just we were up
against two people who who works better
than we didn't it's alright I'm enjoying
this and in Paris do always find my me
that's as I remember do you remember
earlier in this dream when you said I
wonder if there's friendly fire
you stopped with the I'll go to the left
business well you know what we had
already cleared that little bunker area
and we were moving on to the next one
and like in my head I was already gonna
go down the stairs and so then I quick
turned just to check my back and I saw a
figure and without seeing your name over
and I mean you know because well next
time well because here's the thing next
time I'm going to take that moment to
check and they will shoot me and
everyone in the chat will be like why
didn't you shoot him bunker was a bad
poker was the most fun I've had in this
game bunker was a good idea we we were
in the circle we had decent cover that
was exciting we made it look this isn't
gonna be my favorite game it's just it's
just not but coop two-player duo mode
it's kind of redeeming at my eyes
single-player is just a lot of fun
well singles not really single-player of
singles there's a fat load of bullshit
mm-hmm know that bunker was great that's
well that's what you want you want a
little you want to go somewhere and go
on a little adventure I had good reasons
for shooting he well here's the great
thing is you know they're eventually our
families will find our bodies and and
you will have so many bullets in you
they won't know that they came from my
gun but Jack did not kill rich jackets
jank injured rich I shot rich merely and
then afterwards I was calling out to
rich I was saying where I was where and
then I saw that the person was still
crawling around and you know could be
revived so I was like they still got a
partner somewhere rich they still got
partners somewhat and the partner was me
what do I think of the sriracha craze
sriracha is a fine sriracha is a like a
fine spice I know there are those people
that use it on fucking everything you
got a dirty tank top that's not me jack
there are people that use sriracha on
fucking everything and those people like
what's wrong with your taste buds but
you know a little sriracha here and
there isn't bad I'm more of a just a
salsa person put a nice salsa on
something I like I could put salsa on
just about anything but you know what
yeah here and there a little sriracha on
some that's fine you know little rooster
sauce alright let's see here where we
anonymous is rich and Jack finally
caught a live stream shame it wasn't
Friday the 13th I do honestly enjoy
Rich's epic driving and Jack's mad
travel skills
thanks for the hours of entertainment
absolutely you know what maybe we'll go
back to it maybe if they ever updated
we'll go back to it and play a little
bit more let's see here endo cram says
hey Jack how was Vulcan purple my space
bazooka Vulcan was amazing and by
amazing I mean there was absolutely
nothing in Vulcan that was special and
that's what made it so special to me
Vulcan for those who don't know last
week I was gone on a giant road trip
that ended up in the middle of
Bumblefuck Canada and it was farm
country Canada and I can't before if you
don't know like if you've seen a farm
like I grew up on a farm and the farm
country in Canada is way more than you
can ever imagine
yeah it's flatland so you can see
miles and like 90% of the people who
live in Canada live near the water
I believe with that I believe that I
mean I'm sure it's mostly just in the
big cities but but like its its father
mostly those cities that are mostly
along them right you go further north
doesn't care go largely deserted oh sure
yeah once you go north north absolutely
but but also there's just giant chunks
at our farm kind of like America like
weird like the middle of America they
don't got a lot of people that's all
farms we just lower the game audio oh
yeah and anyone can go to my Twitter
Thank You Tiberius I took a planet bunny
in pictures Vulcan so but but what I'm
what I'm saying is imagine here you're
standing in the middle of the road
nothing but farms as far as the eye can
see and maybe a house in the distance
there's nothing there in the small town
we were staying in Moss lead was the
name of the small town we were staying
in Moss yeah we had two restaurants a
diner and a fanciest restaurant no gas
station or general store so if you
wanted to buy something you had to drive
40 minutes to Vulcan or an hour and 20
minutes to Calgary what was the deal
with Vulcan the volkens story whoa and
I'm getting it you're getting this is
the setup rich this is the setup to the
Vulcan store so I just want you to
imagine being in the middle of fucking
nowhere and there's this town called
Vulcan and that was the closest town to
where we were staying and it is a town
that is named after Star Trek yep in
fact you drive in on the main highway
and there is a giant Starship Enterprise
original series Starship Enterprise and
I see that immediately and you know like
I'm driving with my mother my children
and two giant German shepherds and I say
pull over right you know my mom was like
what are you talking about it's like oh
you go over here like we need the gas
anyway go fill up a gas and there's just
and I'm reading this and it was this
giant statue of the Starship Enterprise
and the town is named Vulcan after
Vulcan
and so like I'm just baffled by why
there's a Star Trek town in the middle
of nowhere Canada so we continue driving
I start googling it and like this is a
real town there is a convention a Star
Trek convention in town the very weekend
I'm there called the vol con I'm
fascinated and so like we get to our
campsite where we're staying and we
start unpacking and they say okay well
we need to make a trip into town yeah we
need to make a trip to the general store
and I said you're gonna Vulcan and I say
yeah and I said I'm in let's go janna
pretty sure Curtis from Iowa but I could
be wrong go on right right Mos Eisley
and Vulcan no ma Oh Mos Eisley I get it
like the most lies they can't yeah we
were in Moss we mostly one word which
does sound a lot like most Eisley you
know if they want to start up a
competition with Vulcan
and so I go into town and the town is
kind of half-assed Star Trek everything
there are giant murals of Star Trek and
also like really faded poorly kept
murals that start and it's all innocents
ear because this is just a fucking
gimmicky tourist it's of course because
no we stopped by some of the shops and
we're talking to some of the locals like
we were talking to we went into the pet
store and the pet store had two cats
running around so the boys loved that
yeah playing with the cats oh this one's
seven and this one's captain we named
him after Captain Picard and then she
goes and seven I don't know if some of
them have numbers and I'm looking I'm
like do you mean seven like seven of
nine yeah and she's like oh yeah I guess
whatever and I was like don't you watch
the show and she goes no I'm sorry she's
like really no one in town watches the
show or cares about it at all and I'm
like really
you got a Star Trek town and I was like
why did you name your cats and she's
like oh the the the tourist board guy
came by you know we got these cats here
he gave me a couple names I could name
him I thought seven was cute he gave you
a little name it was a tourist guys that
you know make it happen
this is your pet store lady tour
they're gonna come in here and we need
star trek shit all of the crosswalks my
favorite part is all of the crosswalks
had the federation logo directly in the
middle it actually looks really cool
tell me tell me that you like the walk
and the don't walk sign is like this
tell me there don't walk is like this
rich here's what I'll tell you it's such
a small town
they don't have don't walk and walk so
they did have yeah makes sense they
don't have no oxides they did have a
bust of Spock with his handprint in it
okay because a few years ago before he
passed away
Leonard Nimoy was the was the Grand
Marshall one of their parades and so
they got a statue a bust of his of Spock
face and his actual handprint nice and
in copper or something and you can put
your hand in his hand
giant hands by the way better than mine
was very hard part because it was a big
guy yeah big funny looking guy rug and
funny look at her shirt and
funny-looking exactly cast an alien in
the 60s that's what you looking for he's
a big dude so so that was really cool
and like you're seeing all the murals
and some of the shops like they had a
secondhand dress store called make it so
and has a picture of the card on it
sounds like a joke I know it sounds like
a Simpsons gag did you show you pictures
no you did you show me make it so oh let
me show you make it so it was on the
window oh god wait but you know it's
even better check out right here he
looks like that one like Jesus painting
they got smeared and lady tried to fix
it restoration Riker botched restoration
Riker check out my Twitter check out my
Twitter at at har Lac I posted a bunch
of the pictures you'll see a bunch of
they had an auto repair shop that was um
works auto repair but what I was saying
to myself is like I said well and I was
talking to my mom who doesn't give two
fucks about Star Trek and I was like
that's a funny name to name the auto pot
she's like well I said I said well that
generally Ferengi's are kind of kind of
shysters they're kind of like like
cutthroat businessman and they and they
will they'll take advantage of consumers
at any point because quark was on the
list of names the tourist board gave
them exactly yeah yeah and that's what
she goes are they probably just didn't
care yeah I was like yeah they don't no
one care because no one cares
Jimmy Scotty's Oh Scotty's what was
there was a Scotty's there was there was
a majority right work our way down the
list exactly an engineering thing we're
stopping when we get the belong on this
no one cared about nobody cared about
vana did she do anything in Jim Miri
yeah she was the chief engineer I just
remember her battling sure she I'm sure
she had no she didn't battle that much
oh really the only thing that sticks out
about B'Elanna was when she was gone
what was more just problem was the
writing was owed and the characters the
setup for bolaños is half Klingon woman
who hated her Klingon half she didn't
like the aggressive things yeah it was
fine she didn't just she was angry odd
she didn't like that about herself oh
sure I'm sure you're right
but yeah there was there are so many
Scotty's is the borrow Scotty's pub I'm
sure I'm sure there was a Scotty's pub
there they were so I'm sure you guys are
probably looking at it but here so
here's the fantastic thing so obviously
like I'm going through town giddy as a
schoolgirl my kids hate it they just
don't understand what's happening and
like they've never seen Star Trek and I
was like shut up this is great
I'll buy you a cookie at Spock's bakery
I tried and I tried showing it to him
once and they got bored I'm not pushing
my interest on my children
you know when they're I bet when they're
a little bit older we can watch that
together yeah they're just not ready for
you I love Star Trek when I was a kid
they had same kids hates Star Trek I
loved it they have more options now
growing up and you know what they didn't
really hate it they just didn't
understand why I was so excited to have
them stand in a transporter that was out
in the open
I'm just like why why do you want me to
stand on this day I was like shut up
stand on him so the most amazing thing
I'm looking into the Volcom which I
unfortunately I could not go to any of
the volcon because the whole reason I
was in Canada was for a family funk
yeah which happened to take place Wow
you know during the volcon so I couldn't
slip away because remember Vulcan is 14
a 40-minute drive from wearing right
right
but the Vulcan had big guests this year
and two of the major ones that I
remember off the top of my head one is
the guy who invented the Klingon
language which not a star but you know
that's a sideshow he has a sideshow you
could ask him some interesting
linguistic questions yeah yeah yeah you
invented a whole new language that's
fucked up yeah all right great but so
but the big star get the celebrity yeah
the on-camera celebrity was chief
O'Malley's daughter O'Brien Oh chief
O'Brien's daughter because I was so
wrapped up in the story I want I want a
daughter to be the punchline chief how
sad was this though okay no she wasn't
the girl who played like you know the
the toddler yes daughter or was it like
the one episode the time-displaced
teenage daughter Molly time-displaced
Molly it was the little girl it was the
little girl Molly who is now a grown-ass
woman and I checked out her IMDB that's
it
of course the front toddlers you don't
know if a toddler gonna act or not when
he grows up right I do
I'm not a big as big a Trekkie as rich
as I obviously like the shows but not as
much deep snow sign no no I've barely
watched any decent even though even
though Brian was on TNG he was
I don't know if his daughter was on TMZ
I think she was just you know but so
that's the thing that was their big get
is this this person who hasn't acted in
20 years and was was like on nine
episodes of Deep Space nine that's it I
mean everyone says deep maybe maybe as a
grownup I would like deep space 9 better
but coming fresh off of next gen Deep
Space 9 wasn't my jam she was on Kitchen
Nightmares the family restaurant was
failing nice are we done with this yeah
let's do one more
what time is it I almost I will do one
more fine okay yeah so that's that was
the that was the wrap-up of the volcon
unfortunately I did not get to stay to
see any of it yeah it's it's if you're
ever near Calgary and then want a day
trip it's so bizarre to walk through the
town of Vulcan okay okay and it's still
hard for me to process so I I got one
new t-shirt from my road trip I'm not
wearing it I got I got a can of the
future not a Star Trek dude you're not
wearing it because it's Canada t-shirt
I'm just not wearing it because I'm not
wearing it you mean like right now
you're not wearing it it sound like I'm
never gonna wear it I was like was this
an x-rated shirt it was rich no I'm just
not wearing it today I will I'll wear it
I'll wear it
I'm looking for a new carry pistol what
are your thoughts on the fn57
I don't know what the FN five-seven is
you know carry pistols are tough you
want you want to short enough barrel to
to conceal properly if you're if you're
concealed carrying which I assume you
are because most people do and you also
want something that you can take to the
range off and I'm if I'm a bigger fan of
I'm a big fan of revolvers in general
only because they're so easy to clean
hopefully with any I get you know waiver
it's done with when I try to shoot you
in the head with my crossbow
I just wanna see if it sticks in your
head you got me in the ass I didn't even
seal and camera I can see it sticking
out of my ass I just want to see if it
sticks in your head it sure does
going to first-person look look look go
on the first person on the plane
look at me turn to your side look at me
the whole game all right we go where we
landed where we landed all right the
cluster houses up there on planes left
shit three two one go
which whatever going for those little
ones that look
jigsaw puzzle pieces jigsaw puzzle piece
oh I think um it's not any case you're
looking for a good carry gun I'd say go
revolver because remember most of the
time you're gonna be using these at the
range in fact hopefully all of the time
you're only going to use it at the range
and after you use a gun at the range
it's really important to clean it
properly so it works when or if you need
it oh these oh these houses okay try to
get out roof try to get on a roof and
revolvers are just significantly easier
to clean
oh is that you yeah that's okay there's
no guns up here and this is a hotbed
there's a backpack over here on this
other side okay okay
generally these areas are hotbeds I'm
keeping a lookout for anyone else
landing I wanted a little bit of
excitement Jack no that's fine
grab the backpack ground all the shit
that's fine rich we're in the excitement
no bullets for this gun there's a gun
over there yeah revolver all right I've
got the ammo 407 maybe I don't know but
I have no ammo you probably took the end
here I dropped an ammo okay all right
there's another gun over here by me
pistol fancy more than Amelie her gun in
here I'll take it
yeah 45 caliber that's that'll do some
damage as far as handguns go all right
there shots already there your phone on
here
how are you going here yeah it's already
over there
this one this door is open oh there is
no door cheek pad interesting cheek pad
I wonder what that is
come on gun gun gun gun gun didn't get
in getting good gun okay we're right
outside the circle so we're close enough
where we can we have a little wiggle
room to explore come on different house

cover
son of a bitch wait he's going around
he's coming around
oh I see him I see him rich that's here
right - right
at son-of-a-bitches toying with us
I got me
wasted so many bullets on that farm
he's out there driving around still
over here over here oh he killed some
somebody killed somebody over here
there's crates
no honest if he's driving around again
oh shit we gotta get moving again
Oh helmet nicely helmet how far do we
have to get moving fuck I think I saw
another I saw another thing another car
that we can use where are you I'm
picking with a Suzie wish I don't think
I have any ammo for but no trusted truck
rusted truck alright well shit we gotta
go
we have
are you alright
oh come on it's not the truck you saw
them was rusted yep we got two and a
half minutes we gotta run yeah it sucks
you're out the circle yep it's sucks
when you're not in the circle alright
here we go here we go here we go three
buildings we couldn't find a decent
long-range weapon alright and now is
someone shooting at us or just shooting
to shoot
yeah man yep someone's shooting at us
someone's shooting at us over this hole
huh
I'm working on serpentining damn it gosh
dang it gosh dang it
there they are on that hill there on the
hill on the high seas Oh God
yep you're gonna die yeah you know what
unfortunately I was checking your screen
to see how you were
it's fine oh yeah I just know that was a
person I was shooting at a person you
guys missed the good guns where were the
good guns they know all the good landing
zones you missed two rifles and those oh
that's right those crates
those stupid crates look great stood you
I must say I I just grabbed health items
and ran because the blue circle was
closing in on us one more game one more
you know as long as you want I don't
give a shit hey I got another to do
great and are you using delay to counter
ghosting no I'm not - our fans right now
are playing this game and trying to get
in with us and if you are don't be a
dick how do you even know if you're on
the same server with someone
that's my question is there a way to
know that I don't know who my free will
look was a little broken I hate your
play much I'll hit your play button just
keep playing this there are there are
two there are usually two ways I end a
match
you know like either either I feel like
I did okay and maybe I could do another
one or fuck it I'm never playing it
again
I never have a super strong desire to
keep playing playing solo I've just I've
mostly just had fucking I ever Markel
never wanna play this game yeah yeah
that's you pretty much just that that's
usually what it is absolutely numbers at
the bottom tell what match it is the one
numbers at the bottom Oh
so if someone read the numbers at the
bottom they could figure out what match
we're in well whatever I don't I
honestly just don't care that much when
I come in and this game sucks for solo
playing yes that's the general consensus
I think you know I get a little more
enjoyment out of it than rich guys
better I get no enjoyment you're getting
no enjoyment
I despise going at so low lifes or two
people here I've enjoyed this but and
then watch part of us cuz I'm your
friend you know yeah
let's see here
oh you want to go to the ruins I'll go
where you live eject ruins on top of the
mountain on top of the mountain nope to
your left
you see me
I don't see you my cursor I see that
yeah oh you're gonna be very far away
from me I will meet up I will come
closer to you I'm going those little
town down here at the base of the
mountain I see you
I'm coming close to you
I was gonna have bad
I'm by one little house here and I'll be
by myself but I'll come and meet you
after I leave this house real quick fuck
I missed two guys that landed in that
area I was just by so that's probably a
bad idea to go there okay come to my
little house I'm heading right there
right now I'm sprinting oh cool
is that it one cool gun are we near
anything cool this is this how homes
over here I'm sprinting to okay
and we're very far away from from and Oh
from the circle mm-hmm fuck oh fuck
all right well let's try to find a car
or something oat maybe run for the water
any boats
anything only thing I have is a 2x scope
who are you upstairs yeah drop it I want
I think
this thing doesn't have amazing range
button oh there's people here there's
people here well I have nothing all
right
are you dead dead
got one of them
you're out of ammo Oh oh god damn it I
can't ah God
get my gun velu crate by me where are
you I was dead in front of the house
mm-hmm
you know what has never come up before
I've never had to drop my gun so I don't
have anything quick bound to it how do
we drop guns
nope well shit Oh
I've just never ever had to drop my gun
before and now I have two guns with no
bullets did you drive away I hope you
drove away I think he picked you clean
yeah he picked you clean already I'll
try I didn't even have a gun
yeah oh I think he revived his friend
too Oh
well gosh dang it
that
there we go well I figured it out too
late yep oh wait no that just dropped it
and I didn't want to drop it I think
those are your options well I want it
for later if I find cool bullets I mean
I'm gonna die where did I drop it poor
rich I know I know
well now I know I dropped my cool gun
wrench and I can't find it in the grass
I shot one of them that was exciting
oh darn oh woe is me yeah now no one's
around to check my six but that's how it
works sometimes cuz we didn't find a gun
in time and now I'm gonna die and he
revived this friend so I don't get a car
stupid this search for a gun is
captivating I know I know you're like a
cross between mr. Magoo and mr. bean man
I'll take it I'll take it a Magoo bean
see if this house has anything
well you know I always I I often forego
melee weapons because you say to
yourself when am I ever gonna need a
melee weapon right until we need a melee
weapon but I would've had a melee weapon
there I would have I would have well
alright well I got a gun that's
something
yeah rich didn't stand a chance there
are people there and he didn't have a
gun nothing he could do sorry rich I
failed you yeah oh yeah oh yeah I know
that and that was I take full
responsibility I take full
responsibility for my failure
check out some loot crate's and see what
you got over there check out your rank
that's a it's true you know what at
least this time rich I didn't shoot you
I mean I also didn't protect you but I
didn't shoot you
you know just unmute
today the 26th no today's the 30th 30
that's rolling all the way back here
I'm not yet in the safe zone Nana says
yeah rich and Jack yeah finally caught a
live stream I shame it wasn't Friday the
13th I do honestly enjoy Rich's epic
driving and Japs Jack's mad trap skills
I think I might have read that one
before but that nevertheless it is yeah
thanks for all the hours entertainment
did you read this one yeah we got hey
Jack how was volcán lol triple miss
space
by the 13th anybody that they're
passionate or month
he gave Johnny Cash's what do you think
the Friday 13 good fucking notepad
you review single-player if the game is
still this buggy I bet the single-player
a I will suck really bad probably and I
don't even know they're still making it
those probably just gonna be a promise
that's never fulfilled and I've heard
very little about them working on a new
game so I don't know much about that
yeah but I mean it's I had to imagine
whatever it is they'd be very early with
it
and there'd still be a lot of
programmers free to work on Friday the
13th shit but I would assume or yeah
like one team working a new game one
team fixing Friday 13th that would be
really nice
I haven't heard anything but the game is
you know like I stand by our review like
they're still fun to be had within the
game oh there was bad I don't have a
backpack they have two teams and they
hired a bunch of people to work on
Friday the 13th well that's good because
they themselves we're doing such a great
job right bro dog says hell hey mailman
Tommy and legged hey just want to say
that rlm is the best YouTube channel
ever say hello to Susan and the fat ugly
looking one much love from Sweden
alright Tom too late yeah thought I
could get him I saw him I thought I
didn't think he saw me get out okay
let's let's try to have one more good
all right game alright one more in
general and then we'll call
I mean let me catch up on them catch up
the riddle of still says hey long time
since I've been here also you're still
playing this we want something new like
Friday the 13th great you didn't see so
three idiot says hey rich and Jake it's
been a while since you played an
old-school adventure game though that's
true here was more money to try and get
you to play an old Sierra or LucasArts
and game lol play maloom granite al
rinses rich why are you gonna play that
shameless portal rip off the Turing test
no plants due any time soon
between that and cube it seems like
there's enough games to warrant prereq
episode keep up the great work
alright portal ripoffs yeah I bet I'm
fine I'm fine with you being air about
them I'm just fine with you being about
that pristine four terms festival oh
yeah good idea
surprised you guys aren't playing the
new indie game higher what the hell is
pyre
it's a RPG oh that's an RPG yep
did you crash I did I am exiting to
lobby well there you go I crashed you
guys get to see my sweet-ass desktop
look at that oh it's great I don't like
things on my desktop bridge like an
action RPG like dragons dog mom it's
made by the same people who did
transistor and Bastion I don't know
either of those and I think I've heard
of Bastion you I mean they were they
were both kind of in you know bigger in
the indie scene I guess but uh it's it
might be an action RPG looks alright III
had no thoughts on it it looked a lot
like Bastion and transistor and neither
neither of those held an interest for me
so oh you know what I don't like
wallpaper I don't like I don't like
pictures of shit on my desktop I like a
nice clean desktop clean I don't want
any shit on my desktop
all right and yeah all right all right
so then I'll get it right up in this
slave face oh shoot you the face that's
terrible and then I'll get right up and
this dude's face great mm this guy -
he's kind of a jackass looking guy I did
I made it off the island before time
expired
Peyer is super different from Bastion
and transistor it's like an RPG sports
game oh well there you go with it well

cautious let's see what happens in this
map here and
yep
whoa
rich you're a man let's trees

seems to be a huge issue at this game
run around for twenty minutes with no
action gathering building supplies then
sudden death that's that's like a lot of
the game it's just it's just the game
yeah hey so what do feel enriched you

bit of drinkers ooh never gotta go zoo

I just like cuz I like I had my I have
my at my whole my whole little Mambo
number 5 thing there don't mean right

Ritchie says rich how do you and the rlm
crew keep their sanity by the constant
pestering of quotes such as all oh my
god Tom's festival is this replacing
does it ever get so old that you just
snap now that we snap but you can't just
get disappointed
I'm being dead dead serious sometimes
you see the three hundred thousandth
person to say Tom's festival yeah yeah
and it's just like really oh really okay
get it together people come on you know
it's I I think it's it can be fun and
every once in a while I'll see I'll see
one of those comments that people used
to spam all the time and I haven't seen
in a while and you just go oh I remember
that one I remember that one
let's see here gay Polly says hey guys
any thoughts on the new Hellboy with
Noah del Toro and no Perelman me
personally I couldn't be more
disappointed rich you seemed to be into
the game also uh I still don't love it
alright I like duos a lot more than I
liked going to solo yeah but you still
got like shot in the head one head my
dad you didn't say where it came from
right fuck that right right right right
and any thoughts on Hellboy with know
del Toro or Perlman not really I don't
care much about how boy in the first
place so you know Perlman is was a fine
Hellboy I think whoever they're gonna
have necks is gonna do oh you know who
is gonna be it's going to be the if I
remember correctly it's gonna be the
sheriff from stranger things for playing
Hellboy yeah I believe that's what I
believe that's what I heard someone will
tell me if I'm incredibly wrong soon
enough
and you know what del Toro is a fine
director he is he has an amazing vision
he's not too good at directing action so
I'm actually okay with handing it over
to another another director who maybe
can handle an action sequence a little
bit better so gobbledygook says one last
tip just the tip right in the end but I
get it all right
and ghoul boxes hey Jack and rich I love
realtor media and you guys a lot
whenever I had a few I put on shopping
mall weight whenever I had a few I put
on chopping mall best of the worst watch
drunk jack which is best jack I wish I
could be on the panel it's a you know
you guys see the fun stuff you don't you
don't see the hell of watching these
movies and the silence is you get to see
the good stuff yeah what the fuck is bad
action is awkward action he's the action
sequences in the first two Hellboy
movies I think are awkward and they're
not there any I mean I have no comment I
don't really remember I I don't I don't
feel like they're very exciting and of
course that was early days CG and early
day superhero movies but I'd like a
little a little some better some more
exciting action sequences all right and
there we are caught up and there we are
caught up so now is the point of the
stream in what you think all the people
who have subscribed to us during this
