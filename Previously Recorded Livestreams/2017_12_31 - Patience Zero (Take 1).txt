a little bit earlier than the advertised
time but yeah that's fine that's fine I
I don't I know it's New Years Eve I I do
not plan on going till midnight or
anything weird I got I got places to be
and things to do this is about 6:00 and
Milwaukee time here it was like 6:17
I'll probably end the stream at a little
after 10:00 or around him just just so
everyone knows I was in the mood for
Dead Rising tonight and I wasn't
planning on streaming long enough to be
able to do like a a really good long
full run into any of the games but then
I remembered Dead Rising 2 had a demo a
paid demo but it really it's it's like a
different area than the Dead Rising 2
game it's like its own unique area but
so they released this thing called case
0 it's like a prequel to Dead Rising 2
it's effectively a demo for Dead Rising
2 just it's at a different area it's not
in the any area that appears in the
actual game kind of like kind of like
Metal Gear Gear Solid 5 Ground zeroes a
little bit like that
and I'm gonna let me play that why not
why not all right I guess I'm gonna
start the frickin game up tell me if
there's any problem with with the sound
hey I think I've got it you know I got a
crank a little bit higher than normal
because it's a solo stream I'm not I'm
not always that chatty how was I was
Dead Rising 2 i I don't like it as much
as Dead Rising 1 I don't think it's
balanced as well I mean they added they
added some neat combo weapons into Dead
Rising 2 but overall I prefer 1
all right starter sir a frickin game set
a new game yeah I'm sure I want to start
a new game
reporting live from just outside Las
Vegas it has been almost 12 hours since
the first reports of a zombie outbreak
in Las Vegas
we have our new protagonist for Dead
Rising tooth
he's more boring than Frank West but
he's fine
Chuck Greene's fine I played the PC port
of the first game well I have it I
played it a little bit I haven't played
through it yet but I've played around
with it I've had the Earth's play Dead
Rising he won again I'll probably do it
on my own time I know I know if there's
any valid reason to stream it anymore
because a few years ago I did stream a
perfect Romney of death wise immortal
soul
I got nothing left booth nothing left to
leave this is the console version they
only write this particular short little
game k0 as far as I know it is only
available on the 360 I would love it to
be available through Steam or GOG but
but you know mostly because the 360 is a
piece of shit nobody likes shots honey
but it's very important that you get
this the only emotions so many emotions
Danny like shots you won't have to take
another one for a long time a whole 12
hours this is this is our new particular
sole personality trade and he's gonna he
loves his daughter that's all that's all
this character has and it's fine it's
fine it's just not that interesting
hello anybody here
Katie stay right here
hey that's my truck we played two hours
you probably wouldn't like the Sooners
though I mean I like the first game more
but I don't think Dead Rising 2 is that
much different
we're okay no honey they can't get in
that'll hold him there's no way they'll
break that glass
Katie daddy loves you so much
where are you going I guess not terrible
kid boy side and for figure out how to
do this I don't why you got that in
quotes I'd rather be a zombie a little
fucking brat but it's very important you
need another one before bedtime
you stay here I promise I'll be back as
soon as I can nothing's gonna stop me
from keeping you safe
I played the Frank West Dead Rising 2
version that's called Dead Rising 2 off
the record and I have but but if I ever
do I might I might at some point try to
no death run dead rising 2 on stream
I'll probably do the vanilla version of
Dead Rising 2 just just because it's
easier
nice close the doors
so this is one of two reasons I keep my
xbox 360 around formerly it was three
reasons but but thank Christ they they
released Dead Rising 1 on Steam I used
to keep my 360 around primarily for Dead
Rising 1 but that's no longer an issue
but I still need the 360 for this case 0
I mean I like it well enough the Dead
Rising game you can't get anywhere else
and Ninja Gaiden 2 which I know there's
a version of Ninja Gaiden 2 for the
PlayStation 3 but they fuckin censored
all over the blood and I gotta be honest
with you half the fun of Ninja Gaiden 2
is watching comical amounts of blood
spray all over the fucking place the
problem the problem I have now is you
know because one of the other reasons I
keep my 360 is for Ninja Gaiden 2 that's
now fucked because apparently I found
out when I went to hook this up the disc
drive is now broken and will not open
Dead Rising is currently stuck in my
disc drive from way back when I did my
no death run and I can't get it out so I
don't know how I can even use Ninja
Gaiden 2 on here I would have to buy a
new 360 and the only reason I would be
would be doing it is for dead revs for a
ninja gaiden to some sucks to be me
all right
it's little Katie she needs her
anti-zombie medicine because in this
universe anti-zombie quite a vaccine but
just the turn prevents you from turning
into a zombie even though you're still
infected it's kind of like HIV so I need
to find her medicine so she doesn't turn
into a zombie could i dismantle my 360 I
could but then I I risk fully breaking
it
I'm sure the system wouldn't like it if
I went in there and fidgeted around with
things
this is not a vaccine I know it's not a
vaccine
but it prevents the the parasite from
progressing her condition into full-on
zombie it's like the drugs you take to
keep HIV from becoming AIDS while these
zombies are really a threat they're not
supposed to be if you think the zombies
are supposed to be a threat you don't
you don't understand they're just
they're just an obstacle and other
things are our threats in these games
like like time limits are a threat in
the game there are psychopaths who are
people who have just gone kind of crazy
they are threats in in these games but
the zombies they're just kind of there
and they're in your way and they make
things a little bit more difficult but
in and of themselves they're not a
horrible challenge
oh thank god
yeah I can fix this
all right so we need to we need to
repair a bicycle to drive out safely but
before the government nukes Vegas and
we're too close to Vegas so that's
that's the plot we need to build a
motorcycle
it's too comical how oh this is too
comical you ever watched out of the Dead
this is this is zombies I mean they
could be sprinting raving monsters but
then they're nowhere near as creepy
really then they're just screaming
monsters I think shambling corpses are
far creepier than sprinting zombies if
that's if that's what you're getting at
I don't even know somebody in the chat
thought this was too comical
everything's gonna be here completeness
by that daddy's gotta go ahead a few
things
I can't give it to you too early honey
fast means lost the human heart in a way
the sadness of it all
no seek fast Lumbees to me they're more
like just rabid they're like animals and
shambling zombies they're like corpses
they're like dead and it's me
I find that creepy that's far creepier
then then something that's just like a
really angry person
walking zombies represent the slow but
inevitability of death yes yes
100% yes we all handlebars
a bunch of things I need five bar by
five bike part I don't remember where to
get them that may prove to be a
challenge now where's the egress
there's the egress
slow zombies are also counterintuitive
no real threat acts like them well do
you absolutely need realism we're
talking about that a work of fiction
though
you meant that as a good creepy thing
that's in Irving and unexpected yeah
yeah okay I agree I agree with that yes
how many present creeping words of death
aren't the kind of thing that would fuck
up your day
question mark well if you if you want to
look at it with complete logic it's
unlikely that slow-moving zombies would
would build up those numbers in the
first place
at least not if they're only spread
through through bites like I know I know
the original Night of the Living Dead
and I think and Donovan Ted - it wasn't
just the bite that would turn you into a
zombie I think it was anything that
recently died as long as it wasn't a
traumatic brain injury would would any
any person who died would get up and
walk around even if they're just like
shot in the heart you would get up and
become a zombie
it wasn't an infection
anything that killed you would make you
a zombie it's just biting was one of the
things that would also kill you
undead insects hangin in in the Romero
movies it was just people but the The
Return of the Living Dead movies I think
it was everything
and specifically return to the Living
Dead
and kill these guys fast enough all
right dude is that enough
can you come down from this truck now ah
too many zombies which I guess is the
whole point
alright dick let's go
Zombies man they're freaky yes they are
all right so many money for the wheel
he's got the shop
all right what do you want thousand
bucks and you cost five thousand money I
need money how this guy get some duped
yeah I know after saving them you'd
think you'd you'd think that would be on
the house
hello friend
juice floor still creak you will uncover
missions
it's each mission as a time limit you
can track the time limits on the mission
queue on the heads-up display or in the
watch screen messages will lead you to
survivors of the zombie outbreak
scattered around still Creek all right
you got it you got anything for me now
all right bar all right let's rescue
Lee's let's rescue these bar people
while we're looking for money motion oh
I don't have jump kick don't have a jump
kick miss Frank West and it's awesome
jump kick nope early you're leading me
astray arrow
boiled by a door zombie haha
all right what do these guys need
I said all the money I'm gonna get out
up that's all the money I'm gonna get
out of that mixed drinks all right oh
you got and we'll mix two whiskey's cuz
why not what do you get me what do you
get me painkiller I can deal with that
that sounds like that sounds like decent
health recovery
all right no more wrong with that okay
I'm assuming once I rescue these people
I'm gonna get that case of money
presumably money
I hope you don't want more yes if you
want ready
one of beers before he would come with
me and I was going up take that and
bring this guitar with me still there
yeah it's a great weapon let's go
I'm not at all sure how efficient or
inefficient being with time it's been a
while since I've played this Dead Rising
to have the no time limit option all
right my personal opinion if you don't
like the time limits why are you playing
Dead Rising how much money do I get from
you
fifteen oh that's good that's good all
right there are some people who when
they think of Dead Rising they just
think of wacky zombie mayhem and that's
fine I have nothing against you know
mowing down zombies literally with a
lawnmower but to me more importantly
Dead Rising at least at least the first
one into a lesser degree the second one
is like a time management puzzle game
they're these main quests and they're on
a time limit and have a side quest that
are on time limits and unless you really
know what you're doing you don't have
time to do with them all you don't have
time to do everything you have to you
have to make hard decisions like I you
gotta let that people die I got I got I
got five minutes before I have to be
over there to continue on with the main
case no I don't have time to save that
person I love that kind of
decision-making in the first Dead Rising
it took me but without looking at guides
or anything I was like years of me
playing Dead Rising before I finally
figured out how to like do it all in one
run with without starting from a high
level and I enjoyed that I it for me
that time limits are a big part of the
appeal but if you really hate the time
limits Dead Rising 2 has has a sandbox
mode where you just run around and
there's no time limits of any kind so
Dead Rising 2 off the record kind of
like the the director's cut if you will
of Dead Rising 2 has what you're looking
for
what do I think about the photography
element oh this is neat and I don't need
it it's not the major appeal for me it's
the picture thing keep thinking I've got
a jump kick and I don't
all right they're doing
all right hotel there's a key and a shed
steering wheel is a bike wheel
I've got to get out of here by repairing
an old motorbike
game is lagging I'm sorry it's very
little I can do about it
all right
my video feed is fluid well I might
blame you know this being an old xbox
game and not play I am unable to play
this on a PC there is no PC port of this
particular case 0 Dead Rising I mean
this is basically a demo for Dead Rising
2 but they didn't release this demo for
the PC
I mean just because this is not a 360
it's it's not gonna be smooth as butter
60 frames second 144 frames a second
this is this is what it is man
alright so supposedly you upgrade the
back are putting spikes on it but but
really if you're fighting zombies do you
want a bat with spikes cuz just the
blunt-force trauma from a baseball bat a
plain vanila baseball bat probably you
probably damage two zombies brains with
that but once you got spikes up isn't
that just gonna make the bat kid stuck
in their flesh while another zombies
trying to eat you and you're trying to
yank the bat out of their head I think
you're better off with just a bat
honestly
you don't have any Informer that's great
that's great are you gonna need any more
money but hey better safe than sorry
right
all right servers this hotel I gotta
find
sir ma'am why don't I check see if
there's a mat first what's wrong with me
bowling alley movie theater guy said a
hotel right for a shed
what do you objective out here I guess
the keys in here be my guess I got to
turn around building behind me I think I
need to get in
well that was that was exciting
find those bike parts I'm looking for
somebody key I gotta find was shed and
I'm looking for that building next to me
there's an objective
plates yeah give it my bat for now I
really need some more inventory slots I
need to start leveling up all right so I
probably gotta get upstairs here I got a
the sounds vaguely familiar climbing
something in the alley
I think what I get off me fucker I'm
probably so terrible on time so terrible
yeah climb up the thing zero pushcarts
of some kind come on come on check read
probably you know what probably through
here right
yes whoa that was a nice surprise
ah
that's what I need probably know I can
make that to the shed
Oh
I can make another bad
could really use some leveling up
just need some day of the dead music
probably I can help pretty quiet
hello is anyone there I'm here
motherfucker what do you want
building the goddamn bike I got a rescue
my daughter rescue my daughter fucking
fucking level up already you
motherfucker
excellent
right that's right I need to throw more
Zombrex to Oh God
oh I bet I got a buy it at the gee-gees
jazz match crow crow buyer back over
there really I'm better off just
sticking to them well for the sake of
hitting somebody with a crowbar I'm
gonna hit somebody with a crowbar do you
not have some bricks already I gave her
one dose to begin with but I'm gonna
need more before the game is done she
needs it every 12 in game hours
all right yeah already the inventory
spot though I'll stick with the bat all
right Joe any more survivors for me no
you'd be saying get over here right yeah
I don't think there's anybody else I can
rescue right now
so money we need money bizarrely enough
in this virtual zombie apocalypse it's
not the whole world just Vegas right now
no oil hot bar get over
pawnshop have saw heads on bricks you
get a guess it's gonna be like 25,000
and then I'd like another thousand more
to buy another hot tip on one of the
bike parts all right that should be
enough for now
time to head up the pawnshop now we are
not lasting the midnight stream is
ending around 10:00 Milwaukee time now
you know what I'm gonna let this hum be
run around your pawn shop sir I have no
respect for you
handgun Zombrex 25 yeah I was right
about that next one I prevented more to
more money here here come on in come on
in come on in this guy deserves a zombie
in a store
really use some levelling up
and now I can put on the waitress
uniform honestly I got I got too much
self-respect
chili mix chili with no and he makes
chili and bacon what do I get
repulse I could be to be useful
can I get more efficient to break open
the machine and take the money even if
you're good
I know I know dead rising to the full
little games got a section where you can
play poker an especially suicidal group
of survivors will only come with you if
you've invest them in poker and we
behind the theater map theater all right
around the bend
I'm leaving this door wide open sir
because I don't respect you I'm you got
any more leads and survivors for me I
don't think so
I'll check on my way back
I got to zone vixx's that's good I got a
feeling I'll need more like I'll bet you
this is survivor that's gonna need some
these are their endless hobbies they're
gonna keep sprouting from somewhere
actually I believe there's an
achievement if you kill the entire towns
population worth of zombies yeah
but even if you kill what is officially
the town's population worth of zombies
you the zombies still spawn
work
you dang nag chat chat please do not
remind me of Jack Marston he is a
disgrace to his father
that's a reference to something Chadd
figure it out well you want me to hold
your hand no I love that game
all right I need the money
she wants me to get the gems from over
by the roadblock Katie's got a bunch
time before she needs more Zombrex I'm
good their bikes coming along nicely
actually
it's food water we've done well they
believe the the gem she's crying about
have some been a sentimental value so I
get it I get it alright yes he uses tape
to make a bat with nails I don't get it
either maybe he's really good at using
the tape like a hammer it doesn't have
to make sense
I can level up that would be great that
would just be so great Bob you got you
got you got word on survivors for me
that'd be fantastic rescuing people
successfully that gives you experience
that will help me level up which
something I would really like to do
multiple times honestly all right I'll
get them on my way back from the gyms
why I'm avoiding everything I'm a genius
mostly
I just need a quiet moment
alright alright oh the gemstone show up
as a mission alright I'll see if we can
find him anyway
Jem's by the roadblock get off of me you
prick purse flashlight cone gems gems
leave me some gems
where
that's nice what I get what I get
kind of card yeah good know what I would
have asked for not at all what I would
have asked for where it were this lady's
gems
should have made some of that drink that
repels zombies thought it wasn't
thinking with the beat
it's the God I'm wasting too much time
aren't I I'm wasting way too much time
in there
all right andin this mission
I can't find them I can't find them I'm
wasting too much time
I know I'm gonna need that money
maybe I can find the time to come back
and do it
shit
I think they'd show up is like a
objective kind of thing but it's not
showing up as a case is it on the map as
an objective yes it is I think oh god
damn it wasting so much time on this
ship
I should be right on top of them where
where where where where
it's like them
right there there's an objective cannot
open the crate
they're next to a yellow car I've seen
somebody in the chat say
gosh darn it
holy fuck I'll take it
shoes that's not what I'm trying to do
but I guess it's cute
I can't take this
I just want Sharon back so we can go
home all right
Tia what do you have to say on a stag
party
she was bitten by a zombie making me go
back to quarantine
sure why not
someone screaming for help I can hear
that where are they coming from where
are they from
and so once I played this I don't
remember anything it's weird
all right I am NOT doing good
one dude in the freezer at the bar
that was a dude in the freezer at the
bar you sure about that well all right
we should talk to them before I went to
find the gems I gotta kill those two
birds one stone there's no way I'm gonna
save everybody
and according to the chat I might have
already missed someone so there's that
yep she's gonna want some bricks
stick with me oh fuck you all right I
need to carry you guys see that's fine
that's fine
alright so did I miss a survivor earlier
somebody who's who's looking up some
kind of guide on this game
and needs to know the bar only had two
people all right so I'm still good
presumably
keep it moving
all right normally I might try it out
arm them but this is Dead Rising 2 so
they'll run past everything with little
to no problems have you got any more hot
tips for me bum no you stop shooting me
Bob that'd be great
yeah Dead Rising so you can barely call
it an escort mission takes all the drama
out at rescuing people but it's better
than Dead Rising for we just talked to
them and they vanished fuck that game
close close the leveling up
how much money how much money 15 all
right all right I'll take it when I get
for that level up sorry I'm sorry
I'll take item stock backdrop yeah
the saving is its own reward
Breanna's god
damn straight
do you get the bicycle kick in this game
I don't well certainly not in this this
game you don't you don't level up very
much in this I think you can only get up
like level 20 in this because the way
this game is designed this is exclusive
to the Xbox 360 but if you have the Xbox
360 version of Dead Rising 2 you can
actually import your save for this into
Dead Rising 2 so if you get like up to
level 20 in K 0 then you start Dead
Rising 2 at level 20 I'm just going to
need it's a nice bonus why not why not
we play to have fun right let's do
something stupid mildly fun
let's do this somehow my one drill
turned into three but that's that's just
video game logic
not a terribly efficient weapon I would
say a horribly inefficient weapon at
this point shit
fuck it we're going to get a food item
that works out very poorly very poorly
all right I'm I'm officially done with
the drill bucket but rich hated the dead
rising character they redid which
character you talking about if you're
talking about the new version of Frank
Weston for I didn't I didn't play for
that long before I got terribly bored of
form I didn't like the new voice as much
but that's Dead Rising for this is the
Dead Rising 2 protagonist I think is
kind of boring but I I don't hate the
game
and I don't hate this character he's
just not as fun as Frank West as a
character
yep
thoughts on Resident Evil 7 I never got
into the Resident Evil series
all right 25,000 so I need at least
another all right you have no
information for free so I do need though
enough money to buy that in southwest I
guess
Bob you got something for me Bob blue
I'm gonna leave the casino Bob then I'll
be right over
all right and you're another $10,000
Oh shucks hit he needs resigned bricks
thank you for the reminder chap thank
you for the reminder
chan i think zed rising as the series is
beyond rescue there's no way they'll go
back to the timer format hardcore like
Dead Rising 1 they they're they're
convinced people hated and based on
things I've written the channel how do
you do hated any dead rising she's
doomed
hey sweetie I've got your medicine
yes Dead Rising has been dead since 3:00
yes
I wasn't people didn't realize they'd
get hard they could ignore either the
story or the side missions or both and
still have fun with zombie mayhem
no they just bitched until they needed
to get some supplies
perfect
whoa whoa listen she's not a zombie
she's just a little girl oh I see you
give that shot she's gon be all right
come on now step aside little shit
finish the job
there's no call for that now I'm just
doing you favor better now than later
you're not gonna hurt her not over my
dead body
I've had enough of you zombie lover yes
he has a flamethrower pitchfork
I am so comically dead any other health
scattered around here I'm just I'm not
prepared for this at all
alright alright alright
