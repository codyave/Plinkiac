you seen that movie The Phantom Menace
yeah III went to the midnight the
midnight showing of that oh my god I
even dressed up with my friends oh yeah
yeah I did
and then we all left the screening going
yeah well it's just the first one you
know there's there's a lot of exposition
I bet the second one's gonna be a lot
better yeah yeah
they just have to get a bunch of story
out oh my god we get to create a
character you're you're talking about
shit I'm just doing this that's great we
get to create a character guys
controller WTF the game tells you to
play with a controller don't don't be a
dick the it says it's best when playing
with literally only here what do we want
to go with your um I mean this is up to
you rich this is your play I know I know
ah he knows I don't know if I should be
describing all this shit or they can see
it thief
Oh rich wants to be a thief maybe maybe
oh you should definitely be him no I'm
just gonna be a pharmacist try a night
what the hell sure kind of made a normal
normal character
oh you're not being a lorge Sophie I saw
that too whoever whoever is doing like
the alien Jimmy James knock that out but
it's funny see ya if you keep doing
something that's horribly annoying
that's funny yeah yeah see I should be
talking when I'm doing this but I don't
know what anything does ah all right
physique oh you just keep doing that
yeah we'll hang out and talk oh oh I
wanted to talk about loose trousers
because someone mentioned it earlier in
the stream
I got loose trousers for my Vita and I
was really excited because it looks like
a really neat and interesting game you
know your your gut pile it you you have
to you have to fight aircraft carriers
and stuff like that and it is the
purchase I think I regret the most in my
entire life I spent $10 on this game and
after a couple of hours I was so bored
with it which game was this luftrausers
really really master key I don't know
that me mastery say it's important all
right
all right we will go back and change
that plane based on what people are
telling you to do though or should we
try to ignore that type of stuff ah
with the helmet go on instinct cuz I
don't know what a hide my instincts
worth nothing I don't know what that
opens any basic clock that seems like a
pretty important skill
okay master key all right all right fine
let's step or don't look start the game
with this character okay yeah also we
know that we cannot save but we didn't
want to deal with that Windows Live
fuckery and so it's just like fine we
don't care we're just gonna play the
fucking game you're just gonna keep
playing yeah will stream anyway so
exactly had to save us you're gonna come
back to it another day but I'm guessing
the problem I will just fight it by
myself but then I'll worry about our
shit yeah unless there are limited lives
then we're fucked
dad it's fine everything's fine are
there are there oh let's need a dragon
thing oh my god there is plan fire this
is very important
yeah I'm sure everybody everybody hey
Kawai mecha stop it with that shit
that's dumb what's he doing he's doing
like this that's like a character in the
chat stuff stop it but it's a lair yes
it's very funny you can do a thing with
the thing now stop it they'll never stop
except I did yes I moved the mouse icon
sorry about that
I found the souls of Lords within the
should I skip cutscenes how important is
the story to this game probably not very
neat the first and just we'll keep
playing it a key planet oh this looks
neat the bridge of Isaac
can see this is why I can stream on my
own is I'm just sitting here silent
quiet as a mouse
I'm staring at this fucking game I
should be at least describing what I'm
doing but no I can't even manage that
yeah see if you
the dragon
No
it was all looks very neat yeah very
excited sorry if we're not talking to
the story but uh when I comment on it I
guess I knew what was going on if I knew
the story I had a time sure Oh someone
just asked I was killing American style
we had March detail from the director of
samurai cop we will we will want we will
we're very excited about it if that
helps someone congesting what video
games I play I don't play anything
J is not a gamer I played I was before
but we did that last string yeah we
played Sonic what was the last game you
play the online perfect strangers game
that's it before before that I don't
know probably a Nintendo 64 game way way
back I'm shocked you had a Nintendo 64
oh yeah
I was sorry when I started to lose
interest in playing video games up LB
n64 era
well the n64 was a piece of shit shut
the fuck up the n64 is great have one
good game it had tons of good game into
a two good games what's your two good in
64 games Mario 64 and oq dove time flew
to Thailand of time what about smash
brothers fuck Smash Bros what about
Mario Kart fuck Mario Kart wow what
about Goldeneye fuck whale and I
everybody liked Mario can use a mouse
and Goldeneye it was a shooter no you
couldn't use mouth-fuck Goldeneye
oh oh hey it looks like we might be
playing I am NOT finally playing again
this is exciting this is exciting
yes no I'm not playing games okay
yeah Majora's Mask you know I never got
into majora's mask I think I was too
young I think I was too young to get it
I would I would be interested in
replaying now that I am an adult and I
admitted a previous stream that I
avoided Majora's Mask the superficial
reason that I think young link is a
fucking ugly character model
this is your fate I want to kill
something oh nice catch J so this is
this is a beekeeper yeah this is a bad
environment to get absorbed into a story
for so you know we can get absorbed in
the story later once we I think yeah
this is one of those games where the
story doesn't matter as much as the game
point and it looks like we might start
playing soon which I'm very excited
about I was a neat looking night yeah
the the opening cinematic to Dark Souls
is a little boring oh whoa oh that's it
okay oh I'm moving Rich's moving guys
what is this pillage corpse sure why not
dungeon silky yeah you did it we won the
game guys congratulations we cannot go
home what would read message
oh so tutorial mystic okay great all
rights the camera controls a message
right RB is attack that's weird attack
button Oh
Oh what's a thing yeah that's a monster
you have to kill that monster oh hey you
did it oh I'm making sure everyone says
this game is supposed to be hard so I'm
not taking any chances
hey suck in my foot
all right don't okay so far left stick
hold be today okay these are helpful
strong attack is the right trigger okay
okay so you have like light attack
strong attack dad what's your favorite
movie by Ridley Scott here's the thing
you should know about me I'm really I'm
really bad at remember
please Scott movies I hate runner my
money in
I like Blade Runner I like alien so
there are Prometheus review some people
were saying that I was sucking Ridley
Scott's dick but I'm really not the big
Ridley Scott fan I love alien yeah but
you don't like boy Diamond seen them I
actually don't like Blade Runner and the
math me but it's loves a
gorgeous-looking movie myself
yes sleep board well it's you know it's
if you're not into like the new are the
detective story and I I just never got
into the story then probably hate you
know but I hate you now I've tried it's
almost lots of love that movie you
should have loved I start watching it
was like this looks amazing huh but like
twenty thirty minutes in I I just can't
do it anymore
really I've tried so many times to like
that movie but I just have to come to
accept the fact that I don't okay but it
is a great I you know what
I accept your difference of opinion and
and acknowledge that people have
different opinions and that's okay
that's a really bizarre stance to take
yeah I know I'm sorry to be calling me
horrible things right now
I should be but but we're friends and we
have difference of opinion sometimes I I
really like later I watch by Turner
every once in a while just just because
I and I would like a lot of really slow
for a movie yeah what it is about
blazing under that I just don't get into
that's very strange
yeah it is boring III get it look but it
looks great but it is boring oh it's
slow but I will you know boring boring
has a negative connotation it's slow
like Star Trek the motion picture is
boring I love that move off fuck you
like that that's the only Star Trek
movie that's a Star Trek story yeah
unknown thing exploration discover
what's going on no you know why it's a
Star Trek star because they took a 20
minute story and stretched it out to an
hour and a half it's so fuck oh my god

someone says Jake Lloyd likes red letter
media when we met Jake Lloyd he had no
idea who the hell we were or he was it

be yeah because when we met him the star
wars RVs are out but that was when we
just started half in the bag yeah so but
we had him sign we had him sign an
autograph and we said to make it out to
red letter media just to see what his

right all right we're going back fine

lot to get used to

even know which one it says the Tom
Cruise one oh that one looks that one

looks interesting or silly maybe it's
both and that's okay that's bold didn't
his last movie look interesting though
what was his last sigh fine oblivion
yeah bloody and was very good no but it
looked interesting before you actually
saw the movie yeah
give Jack bald someone already did
someone already did that was God yeah
gave it to me in high school I started
leave you a bad case of mold
I started bombing in high school yeah
well I mean obviously not as bad as I am
now but was it like noticeable like the
people comments on it or anything when
you're in high school if I could know no
one noticed in high school but I could
just tell it was thinning like you know
cuz a bit like you're my hair like at
one point I had a glorious head of hey
oh my god what is that
I don't know traverse the white light do
it fucking do it oh my god that's great
oh my god what did you to Jack nothing
but Jays just doing something oh shit oh

have traversed that white leg alright
alright Jack you get to do this for okay
I'm just gonna get used to the buttons
here real quick guys
Oh probably want to do that heavy light
my sheet shield shield bang which I've
never connected with Cyril and then
right trigger locks on does left trigger
do anything now okay oh and then not
wise let you double hand wield your
sword oh okay I I'm assuming it gives
you stronger hits that you like the lego
movie right do like know my high I love
it as well and you okay you guys hold
like it I haven't seen which way my gone
rich um oh I got killed in then this way
uh yeah okay my god like a movie if if
you're into Legos the lego movie you
will wreck you I don't know where you're
saved you might want to go through that
opening and talk to that guy again I'm
not sure word turn around I just want to
do this oh I love how clung keys role is
cuz that is please denied exactly that's
exactly how someone wearing all this
armor would roll just like boom just to
just press it without doing the
direction Oh a little bit quicker oh
nice okay rich do you like Wind Waker I
think I love winwaker right okay that's
like my my first or second favorite
Zelda game possibly behind Link to the
Past okay what system is that um when
doing some GameCube games you but they
just re-released it in HD for the Wii U
yeah but there's no way I'm paying $250
how much is the Wii U 305 for a new
fucking we use just for that yeah agreed
Oh up here
don't jump oh okay
right-click the right thumb yep there
you have to click it once and then I
haven't played around that there's a way
to parry I'm assuming I'm assuming
that's the second shield button after a
hit but I haven't pulled that off yet
actually it's one of these messages says
how to do it okay Irina hostages yeah
what about link awakening Link's
Awakening yeah I haven't I think I
played it once Link's Awakening is tough
because saving is really hard and now
and that was the game boy one right yes
yeah to save it you have to press Start
select a and B off the same time hate it
okay oh yeah we know that already
left stick but oh yeah there's a whole
bunch of stuff sounds like you're trying
to learn all this stuff while there are
people watching you sure it's really
really awkward left stick
rich what's your favorite comic um voice
you man what about a spider-man fan been
in my second favorite put my actual
favorite comic series aspiring to be my
favorite character favorite comic series
might be preacher oh really
I love preacher I've heard lots of good
stuff about preacher creatures creatures
good like a lot of things preacher is
good except for the ending the ending is
a horrible anticlimax it's not terrible
it's just a lot of build up to okay I'm
not understand this message this is a
left stick forward it well that button
forward or yeah trend
no not for Oh get out of here you have a
shield huh you ever shield well listen
I'm trying to figure out how okay
they're watching us
yeah I don't know oh okay yeah you go
this is all about oh my god it's awesome
that was
in fact I want to do that smart gonna
get you nope well you should walk onto
him first
they're going to kill by the arrows yeah
I'm probably going to be to run they're
saying
I like that it's a no actually like that
it's kind of a clunky action game yeah
this game it it feels like you're
controlling marionette his movements are
always you know they're slow they're not
ultra responsive but somehow it it works
it makes you feel like a clunky night
left trigger repellent on attack after
right button okay bright button right
bumper left trigger right bumper I'm
assuming you have to be blocking with
the shield
oh you see that how did you pull it off
exactly is I he did it and I hit the
trigger and then when he was open you
blocking with the shield beforehand no I
was not blocking with the shield before
ok so just in the middle of one of his
attacks do the shield bash judicia bet
like I just timed it perfectly
hoping it's locked ok someone said if
lunch ever since he was playing this
game he would have beat it already
that's true
he would have potato the shit out of
these good evening potato and everybody

just not true how did I have my help
thing before there is
ok not of my help I like led but he's
not Chuck Norris are you saying that
Chuck Norris is known for being very
good at video games yes

very good at everything that's true
except sucking do it do it jack I'm
doing do it now you're gonna get killed
by this dragon what if I don't want to
jump no I think you should jump ah it
doesn't matter it's time for me shit run
run run run I'm Ronnie hold the B I am a
baby oh my god can I run away again like
you ran away didn't you hey yeah you got
a sword shield I'm assuming you're
supposed to fight it this time yeah
probably I probably can't parry him even
do some dodging I you know what I just
tried to best use some help no cuz help
oh shit I did use help oh oh you're
inaudible poisonous ok roll roll roll no
didn't real fast enough okay that's
alright roll bro
okay he didn't get me that time fuck
fuck fuck fuck I'm gonna hide behind
this pillar no it's not a good strategy
no it's not a good strategy I'm work
plunging attack is what they're saying
how do you do that which is the Osher
that doesn't jump
yeah that's lunge I died again Robocop
50 50 50 just chillin when that ever
comes to mind is Dead or Alive you're
coming to Bay but there I know that's
probably - bitches leave
oh yeah just the movie the movie in
general yeah bitches Lee Vincent Lee
Robocop himself I'm trying to think
about things he's said oh I don't know
the only thing I could think of coming
out of Robocop's mouth is better alive
you're coming with me but get in in the
movie bitches leave it just leave also
who cares if it worked
yeah pretty much any line said by the
the sleazy corporate guys is gold okay
yeah no we're good
I feel bad we're so bad at this no don't
worry about it oh I missed it no okay
okay that's bad yeah but now I'm gonna
get it taking us up no well yeah the
other guys here oh my god
I'm paid you've made this much more
complicated than it needed to be I'll
try anything
block block what I got it I got it
lock on and hit and hit and dead okay
great I think there's another guy over
here
for no particular reason this is
reminding me of Dragon's Lair
particularly them I think it's because
you're a slow clunky night okay sure
dies easy get out of here I was trying
to hit it with my shit you tried to get
fencing I did try to get France keep
dying to play so you take any particular
I was trying to hit him with my shield
you can't do that apparently I mean I'm
sure you can but I was doing it wrong
some are your first impressions of the
game so far fun cuz I barely been paying
attention to the actual yeah Jay you're
you know you're gonna have to play at
one point oh god oh how do we do this
stupid thrust that's I do set a thrust
that's a jump I'm trying to try the with
a bumper that's the kick okay I think
that's that yeah that's it for us he was
alright alright
that's the what they're talking about
and then you have to run away I'm sure
you do that and run away
um and I'm assuming it's more powerful
with the shield put away oh sure that's
the other thing right all right and the
shield won't do anything event against
the big bad guy I can only assume and
I'm all business no Rich's got this you
guys all business business in front
business in back bitches leave no good
time alright that's alright oh fuck it
nope it's already done
that's alright I am liking it even
though it's clunky that's the charm
that's the thing it's but it feels right
for the character because because he's a
slow stupid human being haha I think all
the mechanics are there and right um
it's kind of exactly what I expected
which is a really good thing which is a
couple of key move sets that you have to
learn remove armor to move faster Oh
move armor different class or you can
probably take his home you can write
that his off yeah under the equip thing
you can take
okay I thought that oh nice yeah that's
neat Richa Singh his first parry he's
really excited about it every lost power
what does that do exactly I don't know I
did it why does every enemy look like
Dobby the house-elf
that's really funny uh Dobby the
house-elf it's a hair it's a Harry
Potter thing Oh Oh is it that little guy
yeah okay they do kind of look like
Dobby all right I'm gonna go to the
bonfire then I'm gonna attack the dragon
the monster the demon thing oh you're
gonna go heal first is that the demon
soul is that what that is I don't know
probably so you know I've seen every
Harry Potter movie I said the last few I
would see in the theater and completely
fucking forget everything about it the
next day huh
passing deposit I think the reason
people watch like dumps it comes or it's
just a distraction I would see those
movies like that was pleasant enough and
then completely forget everything yeah
the only one that stuck with me a little
bit was I think the third one because
that was the one that was directed by
Alfonso Jerome werewolf in it yep and I
remember that a little bit more but
that's about it
we're always a positive outlook here on
the one who did you lot tango yeah that
was the third okay weird yeah that's the
one with you're the old derailment yeah
yeah that's the only one that has stuck
with me at all how do you remember I saw
the final movie I remember how it ends
if we go down the stairs if I'm looking
for the bonfire so I can regain that
health before I you have to go down the
stairs or jump don't jump probably
because there might be fall damage uh
what stairs we're the stairs I can't
find the dams to the left okay okay or
you can press X to use the healing
potion but why is the he I don't know I
don't want to waste a healing pads these
game have a right idea yeah this game is
supposed to your fire press X to heal
why no why wouldn't I want to use the
bonfire
possibly now you'd have to fight
everyone again everyone saying don't go
to the bonfire oh well guess what we
just did can you can you explain why not
I'm curious well well I guess we're
gonna find out hey but it was the
prisoner in Azkaban that was the one
that Jay likes yep all the enemies
respond that is he doesn't even that's
fine I can deal with some responding
okay but yeah so now we know hey guess
what guys that's how you play a game you
learn you learn by doing oh no some
saying don't listen to people talking
about the bonfires so maybe I'll have
you know if we should probably just
ignore whatever they're telling us to do
it just respawns all the enemies so he
has to fight them all again so he could
lose all the help that he just regained
um but with every pastor you get a
little bit better at fighting so it's
possible he might not lose anyhow this
run and I have so far so don't fuck
yourself wrong button I was great that's
just quick
I love his roles because it's just like
he falls down all right here we go
traversing the white light people we're
doing this yeah
going to handed now if you want Oh
plunge right now why not I'll get a kind
of
that plunged the jack shit
oh my god you are so long how to find a
place to go heal oh my god get out of
there
uh and you're dead so much for business
do you hate I feel like we did a lot
better that time
remove skeleton remove skeleton what

you didn't plunge well how do i plunge
Oh like falling down is that what they
mean I don't know where's my shield goal

Oh Preston oh oh fuck this we're
learning attack what you can attack
while falling okay is what people are
saying okay hmm okay why didn't they
just say that I don't know in about in
about 15 minutes we're gonna take a
little break
that's because that'll be an hour I
blame everybody else for my failure
sorry at all that's funny leave the
message in front of the door it tells
you how to punish okay oh okay

coming no thank you

the door press X to remove Skellington

game is very spooky it is a neat looking
game I like the atmosphere of it yeah
how do you very much actually invade
attention how do you actually use the
health press the X button okay okay but
so now you can you can remove your armor
