Capcom they put it on PC
contains a single podium and for report
writing tables on the far wall are eight
pigeon holes on the front wall there is
a blackboard okay
look at the table
great there's a newspaper lying on the
table dum-dum get newspaper pick up the
mornings edition of the little tribune
ooh don't pin the city we what was what
was up from the movie
we need more dope pushers and pimps need
mom pushes a bit recruit recruit love
tips maybe recruit more tips we did more
dope in the city recruit one pushes and
pimps ones beautiful peaceful quiet city
with few major crime problems is now
experiencing rapid growth and prosperity
but along with growth has come an alarm
innate increase in crime rate that is
what see page two oh okay wait smug
Ville USA president
Pecola was in smug Ville yesterday
evening observing the annual migration
oh right see don't feed oh you see that
I special see page two
oh okay there you go let's see here of
the writ Oh
let's switch sides for no good reason
that's really weird
learning a piece of Lytton police
sergeant john Dooley states that
dangerous drugs are showing up on the
streets and in our schools the homicide
rate on thee and prostitution oh I
thought the homicides prostitute
homicide rate and prostitution are at
level the city has never seen the
Tribune has learned from huh look
Burge continued from page one right of
the red-bellied swamp coddlers the
president who has been a bird lover
since childhood rich the baiting dance
of the cuddler as being as spectacular
as the golden crown scumsucker the
president can lee admitted that he was
skipped the geneva arms convention to
watch some old cobblers mate
the president says of bill is presently
before the Senate for cramming
proclaiming national cod lured a
reliable source that a big-time drug
deal with a street name of death angel
may be responsible for the drug traffic
oh that sounds like plot well so and
this is called police quest in pursuit
of the death a yes I'm assuming we need
to pursue the death angel
it's weird like as already there's a
comedic tone to the game yeah but we're
also pursuing street drugs named pusher
named FAA let's see how they totaled the
line they're gonna ride that line and
you wanna remind us you should read the
rest of this shit we should we should
let's see here I'll do escaped okay look
in the city jail reported the escape of
a female prison inmate last night oh
right
the officer of the Year nominees Litton
PD chief Whipple stick has nominated
Sonny bombs and Joe Florine foot Florine
flustered that's low that's the other
one I see a skimpy one oh Jesus bonds
and Walters Walters 4l PD officer of the
year war due to outstanding
effort and commitment and crime and
crime prevention and we're bonds right
we're some bonds yeah yeah yeah fucker
Lureen flustered flora Paxton flew the
coop by hiding beneath a pile of soil
prison laundry and a hand push basket
kingdom of Daventry I'll god they're
putting in a King's Quest reference you
know this quest game is now under siege
by a renegade three head and trackin one
identified gnome stated the kingdom is
in a state of emergency so what you're
saying is the quest games are in a
shared continuity universe
they shouldn't be they are they
shouldn't be but apparently they are
this this was well before the marvel
cinematic you a there's an easter egg in
space quest for your escape pod can
crash into king's quest that's great
hopefully we're the one hopefully were
the one with the glasses and mustache
that's what I'm hoping
cuz that guy is badass doesn't look like
we have glasses or almost just I want a
moustache I got here put down pepper
nose is your in that thought
Oh briefing is about oh we're here is it
you don't have time to relax take place
I don't eat it all right
I'll just find an empty chair see that's
got to be the guy with the moustache
they go this is yours oh hey what do you
know that you did it rich you did you
figured it out without even knowing oh
so that's the guy who's he's also up for
a nomination I'm going to assume as much
yeah he looks like he has guys is that a
mustache
that's a weird question from Hong Kong
rich how do you view world building in
games that's great what like that can
you be more specific on what you mean
very weird question yeah like it's good
when a game builds a world thief thief
built a great world yeah
the order well that they tried they had
a lot of good ideas their world wasn't
very fun I think we kind of dabbled on
that during the blood-borne episode was
just like just let us soak in the world
on our own you know yeah in police quest
we already kind of know it's gone
there's this president there's some
drugs there's a death angel I'm into
this world
alright alright Sergeant John Dooley
briefs the thirteen hundred shift
beginning with the latest hot sheet of
stolen rides yeah dog welcome back run
so sergeant Chantilly I hope you enjoyed
the long way round nice nice well what's
up he Burks we're looking for a black
1983 Cadillac I'm glad he's in 1983
cattle a license number LP one two three
eight GI n oh yeah you know what could
you get your handy dandy notebook of
doom the guy on C 0 3 4 5 6 - 1 8
they'll remember those numbers because I
said you will reported stolen last week
try hard to find it so I can get that
Malcolm Washington character off my back
for a change is C is that a 0 C 0 yeah
yeah there's a line across I'm assuming
that's a 0 the lop one is definitely old
because there's no line across 0 3 4 5 6
- 1 8 got it the little T's Eyre this
last night three teenagers were arrested
in three separate arrests each for drunk
driving two of the three were in
possession of cocaine
all three attend Jefferson High School
that should tell you something boys and
girls sure write down Jefferson the
high-school drug drought and I probably
won't come on but uh but they were on
possession of cocaine
oh we are going to be in search of the
death angel who I'm assuming sells
cocaine maybe we should just check out
Jefferson High at some point I don't
remember I mean almost any of the
solutions in this game go so I made a
note of Jefferson High School I'm
something of a blank slate
sure well that's it for today watch your
Bucs kids we don't want old chief
Whipple stick lying about our industrial
injury injury stats going up again
Sonny bombs your call number will be 83
- 32 83 - I'm telling you specifically
even though the whole room is full of
people goodbye yeah my briefings over ah
Red Dog Gold team ah wants to know if we
like hidden meanings in movies or do you
prefer the film to lay out its meaning
slash attention for you but I felt fine
choices I think is a dumb question I'll
judge these things I guess in a case by
case basis I don't know right it's
always fun to kind of discuss the head
meetings and movies and you know if
they're clever about it it doesn't
really matter but yeah movie that's a
cubbyhole right they called it something
pigeon pigeon hole ooh
Sonny how's about at 1198 on 1198 at
carols caffeine castle later in the
shift oh wait we have to look up the
manual here
they had different cult members for some
for some a 1198 it's like coffee break
or something sure what is it 1198 I have
the manual in front oh come here okay
1198 is a meeting okay 1198 Carole's
coffee castle
Carroll's coffee castle got it okay rich
you have a strict worldview you're more
of a shoot from the chip kind of doofus
I having a dog ma so I guess I'm shoot
from there we all do what we can
yeah we all do we can the important
thing you know even if you have a strong
worldview is to be open to new ideas and
change them when new evidence is
presented Pluto is no younger planet
yeah
and that's an okay thing oh now now
we're in the chief sauce oh shit get out
of there
uh What did he say he said get out of
here well yeah if I can get out of there

in there she Knicks I'm gonna go out on
a limb here I know this is very
important to you I'm gonna say there are
no spikes in this video game I think
it's a fair assumption we probably need
a gunman
I mean we do inventory as keys the
newspaper and the radio extender and
what assume guns are needed yeah we good
take off pants shit oh I'm not reading
that oh oh say foo back out of here just
to shade you getting close enough to
dance with and Lord all the knows I did
enough dancing last night is that Allah
is that a lady or man uh men okay it's a
men's locker room okay
listen man listen hey fool big I got it
here just a shade you getting close
enough to dance with and load on the
nose
I did not dancing last night you're
right that's that's the voice that's the
voice oh look there's somebody in the
can we'll talk to him hmm open door oh
my god a Michelle I don't know if that's
casual racism or just stereo I like
stereotyping yeah it necessarily racism
obviously they made a stereotypical
character I'm just going along with with
the theme the Luton PD locker room has 2
rows of full-size double stack lockers
with a bench between them two showers
and three toilet stalls where's my
locker
Oh Oh God
all right personal gear you see your
weapon in your gun belt there is a speed
loader of ammunition on the shelf
great your briefcase rest on the bottom
of the Locker great keys your Corvette
are hanging on a hook how do you pop a
word on that world the take your we're
gotta be on the tape we know that's
great that mean if you were have to take
and then you got like you got to choose
what bribe you took from what mobster if
we're a cop writing please simulator
yeah
yeah we are we are on someone's payroll
that's not the delay met dee dee get gun
belt
yep it's be loader yeah 20 G's take gun
pull back hammer shy get the brief shoot
self and head you suppose there's
anything I need in the briefcase maybe
look in briefcase phase vams okay I will
oh shit there you go I'm going to assume
I don't need the Corvette's
press X to accept cash bribe absolutely
by the way if we get offered a bribe a
fucker taken and I got a Corvette papers
loaned gun alright weapon is loaded whoa
that may have come did bite us later we
pull out our gun and click click click
yeah but what if someone takes their gun
what if someone steals our gun if it's
loaded hey no I think most cops don't
carry briefcases when they're out on
patrol but also we're not carrying a
briefcase now because it's a video game
I'm AB denied oh shit how could you do
it no we're not committing suicide today
that's right be cool about firearm
safety but I'll so you know we need to
make sure our gun is loaded right I hope
I don't have to like equip the belt or
something I think I hope it's okay just
in my inventory I put bailed on their
wear belt I'm gonna assume it
automatically yes now this is this is a
puzzle I remember you have to inspect
your vehicle before you get into it
you're through inspected all sides
yeah if you don't you drive you you pull
out and then car like explodes game over
do you find a bomb no it's just you have
to check the car before you go out I
wonder if that's in the manual your mark
patrol car features a powerful v8 engine
choked down with the very latest in smog
devices and purchased from the lowest
bidder it is capable of attaining speeds
of up to 87 or motton or more miles per
hour
Wow so you can kind of can go back in
time in it that's quicker yeah well no
you can't right because if they go 88
miles per hour or over but apparently
the low is 87 Oh 87 or bucks which one
is mine
there's like six cars which one is mine
let's see here
handcuff procedures personal hygiene
Percy I'm reading the manual right now
yeah I'm seeing if there's something
about inspecting your car check car
there's got to be that killed me as a
kid I needed to use this year our
helpline to solve that one because they
actually had an 800 number you called
yeah yeah that's great
there's an automated thing what part are
you stuck at for solutions on how to get
past or add a dial to hahaha oh yeah

speed up everywhere it is what I did the
safety inspection

gawking at a green sedan that attempted
to carve its own door in the side of a
brick building okay alright get out of
the car
oh my god oh this is exciting this is
great why they're crash percent Oh like
procedures we need to do oh yeah there
are crash procedures hold on hold on oh
wow I love this game a lot of manual
looking up here driving codes
intoxicated driver procedures felony
traffic stop procedures routine traffic
stop producers when a violation has been
witnesses stop the violator as quickly
as possible so no there's nothing about
crash procedures it says detect possible
intoxication by observing erratic
driving you know being a highly trained
observer you immediately notice a
smashed coupe on the sidewalk in a crowd
of rubber necker's milling around nearby
the crowd includes one particularly
anxious young man oh look at car this
man slumped over the steering wheel look
at man okay closer you take in you take
a deep breath look in the car and see a
male slump motionless over the steering
wheel
oh no a closer look reveals a bloody
injury to the left side of his head
and a gaping hole in his lower right jaw
oh God we we have a possible homicide
oh and I don't want the death either the
building no I'm not exactly what I want
look a face hole
that's a job for the corner
well they said one of the men of letter
was anxious yep get over there
Jesus Christ this is exciting this is
great rich you sure you don't want to be
in the controls no no I like you at the
controls or else everyone's gonna make
fun of my typing again little old lady
in the crowd cries out officer do
something that man is hurt bad to help
him okay Dwight's gonna use a radio to :
oh um let's see here radio codes use
radio you have nothing to report
investigate the accident scene see if
you can discover something oh okay um
talk to men a little old lady in the
crowd just like yeah yeah yeah ray the
the there's a Cody 1141 for an ambulance
that's not gonna do much good now oh
shoot matted leg right look at young man
which one is the young man sighs only
bright like I don't yeah he's balding he
can't be young the blonde one
I'm assuming when I say man it goes
automatically to be yeah the guy in the
car
fuck you what does it say look around
you immediately notice the smashed coupe
on the sidewalk and a crowd of rubber
necker's milling around nearby the crowd
includes one particularly anxious young
man Todd talk what about talk to young
man lowly come on now you're the jerk
gets to there you go Oh
first of all it's a nightstick oh yeah
that's right
no no I'm good I merged it with billy
club get um get I think you'd like now
that you're right in front of them say
talk to young man you're kind of in
front of that lady so
nope all right maybe I have to do more
at the car first
did it say something about the
windshield yeah well I can see it looks
like this hole yeah
just below the broken glass of the
driver's window has a strange pattern
for a car wreck it appears to be a
bullet hole dum-dum dawn GW and examine
glass see nothing special examine hole
and then it's just the day yeah yeah oh
yeah you're right take off pants I think
that would help in this situation the
man's dead with a gunshot wound right
yeah it's a pole stuff fuck is there the
bricks won't have uh
oh yeah maybe look for bullet all right
all right well it's probably in his head
sure that's uh but that's a hometown
markup that was thank you for that
suggestion uh okay so we shouldn't take
suggestions because they know they need
the game the guides and spoilers
oh but by the way you're looking at your
own gun oh so I think that was a genuine
thought okay well that's good then I'm
sorry for accusing you of things that
you didn't do because that's a horrible
thing maybe can you like check the crowd
for like a gun bulge ask about accidents
how can you do that
and you can't radio for an ambulance
well you probably have to find that
fucking old lady's to shut up we want to
talk to the young man how do we talk to
the young man each radio nothing to
report
I have gunshot to report how's that some
people are suggesting you check the
trunk I was just actually just about to
do that okay and other people are
suggesting you you look in your
briefcase oh that's not a bad suggestion
now okay which a briefcase yes I don't
know later the yeah mister glitch as you
see we've been trying to look at our
briefcase and it's not letting us do
that once some I saw someone say like
can we try to radio for help as soon as
it says that's a job for the corner like
maybe like the corner is is the trigger
hey alright alright it's probably more
we need to do the body yes and real no
pulse no breathing no vital signs there
is a bullet hole driver's window this is
not your normal traffic a normal
everyday traffic accident in your
opinion this man was murdered
yes okay well we know that's new text
and rail means rail no no spoilers don't
help us out we're trying to figure this
out on our own which I know could be
frustrating for you guys sometimes but
this is the fun of the game okay window
now can you call for backup that was a
new text okay there you go
ten-four yeah we can't be 1a 7pc
homicide okay we advise one homicide
unit is on route and then the coroner's
office has been notified continue
investigation all right now maybe we can
talk to the crowd now that yeah I just
want to see you've investigated the
shooting for sure now now that okay lady

recorded live okay do you wanna um go

manual and it says you know like if from
routine traffic stop procedures what a
violation has been witnessed stopped the
violator as quickly as possible to
mazuma minimize the hazard of high-speed
driving you must have good reason to
believe a film felony has been committed
in order to do a felony traffic stop and
then you call the radio dispatch for
backup unit
