little bit but you'll get it we didn't
watch it first but I don't know what
went wrong
did you watch it through final cut is
Jay what he did what happened you you
probably were watching it like in the
editing software and then he set it to
export because it takes a while to
export I am Not sure and then he didn't
watch it which you know you don't watch
everyone all the time but you're sipping

thanks for your help
great thanks for your help save so Steve

the blonde jack oh yes oh and Steve the
blonde was the radio show announcer and
then Jack was the was the elderly Jewish
man following me to my car
why are you following me what's going on
oh that's strange
oh he's stuck weird that is weird you
know what that is weird now he's
standing right in front of the card
suppose when I Drive away
we'll just mold this guy down just drive
right over my hope Thanks
I hope you don't I really want to
re-watch Mad Max by the way yeah me too
really max is so fucking good and we
talked about how much we love the new
Mad Max I think in general we have we
won't get into any specifics cuz you
know we don't want to spoil anything yet
and we should probably wait until like
Jays here and then we can just me if
idiots haven't seen it yet go fucking
sicko fuckin see it it's Mad Max give
the money they made great movie then
they make a money action movie they
finally made their money back finally
made the money well okay
it took him it took him like a week to
make their money man look here's what
disappointed me with all the practical
effects cuz I want where I'm mostly one
it's for practical effects to catch back
on ok
and I don't think just making their
money back is gonna be enough to have a
revitalization in the industry for
practical effects this movie wouldn't
even gain Buster's it's for that to
happen and it hasn't well now everything
else is now everything's profit
it's basically and this doesn't count
DVD sales video on-demand sales like
it's gonna make money its profit now as
V V V the tape decreases exactly been in
the theatre for two weeks exactly but
it's not it's not gonna be gang Buster
is not gonna be gangbusters so they will
not make shitload of movies with good
practical effects brother well
everything was for not only George
Miller we did get one good movie out of
it we did and here's the thing George
Miller
he's only 70 he's still gonna may he has
like 1012 more films in him he's gonna
be fine what are we what are we doing
what's on the docket
well we got so now I guess head back to
the station
oh with her Murray and the operation
Sweet Cheeks
3
the operation oh that's right the whole
duration hotel so do we need to head to
the hotel oh I'm sure we need to go to
the police station probably taking ready
for operation hotel yeah and see you
know what I think pray Lord Belmont says
I like practical effects but I wish more
movies would be shot on film and I don't
care what movies are shot on film
digital as long as it looks good I don't
care
yeah and practical effects always look
better than digit yes this movie is
proof of that and I'm okay with digital
effects I'm not as hardcore as some
others here at red letter media are
about digital effects I'm okay with
digital effects but like the film shot
on film shot on digital thing does not
bother me my least favorite thing in
masked man Mad Max was the one thing
that was obviously CGI the the storm
that they do show on the trailers all
that stores so cool there yeah but you
know it's like the storm isn't like the
focal point it's just there yeah except
on the one card does get sucked into it
but you also see in the trailers exactly
that's right that's right perfect our
capture the light in the best way
possible that's the thing and you know
those are those red cameras look really
pretty those Alexis look really pretty
and they're a ton easier to use in the
field then film cameras are and so if we
can get better looking stuff quicker
turnaround time yeah someone's saying it
needs to make 300 million to break even
150 million yeah but that the production
budget is not counting advertising yeah
and usually you estimated advertisers
are really hot or heavy million hours
for the advertising that's been done on
this movie it could be oh my god okay it
could be that's a fair estimation I've
heard I've read reports that we should
really estimate it's about 50 million
worth of advertising because it wasn't
total saturation unlike Jurassic world
Jurassic world is fucking everywhere
yeah yeah and I'm absolutely zero
interest right so their advertising is
projection well no they're there
actually hurt I hear hybrid dinosaur I'm
like I'll fuck off the report just came
out today that they are expecting a huge
opening weekend yeah I don't know why
why are people hyped about it I have no
idea just because they love the
franchise and here's the thing last two
are black people don't love the
franchise people love the first movie
when you step over to my gosh okay okay
I've devised a plan to infiltrate their
their Grambling Sheena the Hotel del
Floria
what's that Morgan we get the time
Morgan begins truck honey hi I want you
to check into the hotel under the name
of Jimmy Lane brakes 10 I read that that
there was something they planned it to
be Stein but they forgot the other yeah
thanks toons a weird name
yeah he continues Mitch sweet chicks in
the hotel cocktail lounge okay
Sybil sweet cheeks that you're right up
again the operation by ordering a drink
she'll pretend to recognize you as
whitey her old friend who we recently
released from prisons
she'll introduce you to the bartender
Whitney Roberts whom we believe was the
contract ran for the rap room hustle
nice nice so whitey whitey it took four
notes well we're we're Jimmy Lee
Bankston aka whitey yeah baby
great enter the bartender is woody
Roberts who she's going to introduce us
to he's the guy for the knees the
contact man for the back room hustle
hustle back room man gotcha he's the
back door mayor how do we feel about the
new Terminator movie and do you think
there's any chance it will be good I
don't think there's any chance that will
be good though it might be deliciously
convoluted Lee bad but III think there's
zero chance for quality because it's it
looks like the exact opposite of
everything I liked about the first Tomb
Raider which my simple perfect
story quality quality storytelling and
this just looks like a clusterfuck
quality storytelling with a with a hi
premise yeah right yeah
killer robot sent from the future yeah
now what's the cost refer now it's a
clusterfuck it well and more so it's a
clusterfuck banking on brand recognition
the only reason this movie exists in its
cluster fuckity form is because of the
Terminator franchise yeah you'll be
carrying a large sum of money out and
Mark those of course and it'll turn to
behavior for action nice
lieutenant Morgan Clues so flora develop
your disguise I'll let her fill you want
out of the details great which ones
Laura she's the blonde sunny she's the
one you're doing kind of something for
ya
sunny I've picked out a white suit for
you Laura says and by the way we've
decided your hair must be bleached my
hair because you gotta you gotta look
different you're an undercover cop now
you'll walk with the aid of this special
cane its handle is really a detachable
22 caliber Magnum Magnum derringer
suddenly were James fuckin Bond fuck you
sweet when the need arises you will
carry a voice transmitter disguised as a
plain looking ballpoint pen totally
James blonde yeah later
I picked up these supplies at the beauty
shop take this bottle of bleach cream
activator into the shower and bleach
your hair also I need you to shave your
balls
that's not further mission that's for
later
that's all I that's all I have concludes
Laura sweet cheeks do you have anything
to add an excited voice sweet cheeks
Oh sunny so happy we get to work with
you oh why
it's almost brings a tear to my eye I'm
looking forward to spending tonight
working with you at the hotel

good that was devolved into the
transformation is complete oh I wish it

inform you that I've just received a
phone call from Jack calm his daughter
Cathy just died without ever regaining
consciousness enjoy her lighthearted
game kiddies what was she supposed to

that's it
No that's fucking crazy rectum
immediately jack is on extended family
leave Jack's taking this really hard his
brother's staying with him and he
requests no visitors
I'm sure sympathy goes out to Jack
there's climb a need oh my god so Jack
totally killed that guy might not like
it
my guess is Jack is the one that Wells
up inside you you vowed revenge for
Cathy's senseless death by tracking down
the dope world animals responsible I
love your sunny inner monologue great
yeah ed Witten
the the the chief of police is now
Mickey Mouse because rich lost his my
Jimmy Stewart is gone yeah oh did you

did you take the activator and hair dye
and whatnot no I'm assuming this stuff
is in the locker right

it was in your locker I thought they
handed it to you there is maybe that's
it that's a mandatory okay I'm gonna
take a shower

hair well you have to do it in your
shower yeah I just wanted to make sure

thing like the humour of the game mixed

chance to say goodbye to her family but

lorises oh I need a microphone boy

lieutenant Morgan is waiting for you

on your duties at the hotel
contact me I'll send over a team of
detectives serve your pebbles $10,000
and you sure hit funny mr. big oh that
is the first mention of mr. big yep I
mean you could say don't forget that we
want mr. bigger oh by the way we're
looking for mr. bacon just in the office
intercom mulches come on look out a warm
homicide detective officer Howell photos
all on the line for you wait you wait
patiently about Morgan grumbles on the
phone when the conversation ends Morgan
Morgan relates Hamilton's comments on
the floater found this morning and
gotten go
Morgan says okay so J yes while we have
a moment in between characters but if we
get introduced to a new character you
will have to do a voice would you like
to explain what happened with the the
glittering victim very simple
wouldn't realize until we upload it we
always you know we'll watch the episode
like my geta to this one so I hadn't
seen it so we'll watch it you know
straight through before we upload it but
we watched the HD version we didn't
watch the web version so we did not
double check the web version so you
export to different versions we export
of just a full HD one just to have it
yeah and then we export a web version oh
okay interesting yeah we do and that's
the completely uncompressed HD sure and
then we do an HD web one which is a much
smaller file of course so we didn't we
didn't watch that one out of time watch
the full one instead and so there's a
problem but now I have all this
wonderful material to make in an
experimental music video with I think I
have to do something with that as some
of it was really weird people are
posting screenshots and stuff I saw like
they were tweeting at us yeah that's the
thing is I don't know if the full motion
is as weird and creepy as some of the
stills they might do a combination of
both mmm but I want to make some sort of
music that's great but it's funny
because it's like the first part we
spend so much time talking about the
let's sing and dance yeah like that's
like like over the first half of the
video we're gonna blow up I fucked up
didn't check the car oh whoa yep nope
there we go
you lost the game yeah cuz it did you
didn't check your pimp check minute
check them car that's it good you saved
yeah okay so yeah this is it it wasn't
just a matter of re-uploading the
episode like we have to react sport it
which for anyone not familiar takes a
long fucking time for an hour video at
1080 quality oh god it takes hours yeah
like that's why I came back here check
to see how far along the export is
because I started hours ago and it's
like a quarter of the way done oh geez I
mean yeah it does rain in final cut
anyway it ramps up after a while yeah it
was quicker but it's slow going for the
first few hours geez
final cutter do you go take it to
compressor uh we use final cut usually
right although the last couple videos
have actually exported from premiere
trying trying different things but I
were you were you exporting right from
premiere did you send it over to media
encoder right from Perth next time send
it over to Media encoder because then
you can keep using premiere oh sure but
I only meant usually what I'm exporting
I'm not planning to do anything else
anyway oh sure recruit more RAM yes we
need more RAM we don't have what's the
super powerful Mac the pro I guess the
funnel the pop I used to have the power
mac way back in the day Oh super slow
now yeah they don't even have towers
anymore it's like a little canister
looking this isn't a beautiful-looking
it apparently funnels air for better
cooling okay but yeah I would probably
export quicker with the head yeah we
don't have that you would also export
quicker with something like premier
because Final Cut only takes care of
about it only uses about half of your
available ram what you're saying is you
need to stop using your your I watch I'm
exporting the the the episode on my iPad
oh really
yep will be ready in three weeks the
episode
you know doohickey there are those of us
who really like the Mac operating system
and yeah I'm one of those people there I
hate PCs I hate working with them yeah
especially with what we do
Mac's are quality with straight
nightmare they work very well with
editing software I've I've heard many a
horror stories of people working on pcs
I've experienced horror stories of
editing on PC yeah the reason I switched
over to Mac yeah I was my sole reason
for switching over to Mac years and
years ago was for video editing ah and I
suppose yeah you're right we were pcs
just mean personal computers we're
talking about Windows machines are we
don't much care for them this is not an
important debate to be having no settle
down everyone we could build the
hackintosh that's true but part of the
thing that makes Apple so do you know
where the hotel is
yeah okay oh yeah we went by it we went
by an earlier is you know because Apple
is kind of in charge of all the software
that gets onto the Mac they can kind of
specially build their hardware and
software to work together is the rumor
at least I don't know if it's true but
oh man this is a swanky hotel yeah good
thing you got your pimp clothes on they
won't let you in without pimp clothes
hahahaha equip pimp clothes promptly can
