if I go back to town maybe did you read
what he said no yeah all in bank
attention
hmm something seems fishy always that
guy back in town going on about oh no a
lot of track back there oh yeah oh yeah
yeah let's go back down oh okay so you
can direct it out or you can go down to
that cue and play the suspect and try to
beat this Specter night okay so you can
do either this is just like new now I'm
just assuming I can do both mm-hmm okay
you do what you want rich I don't know
what vector night is it's a different
kind of he's a different kind of mouse
oh just regular level yeah it's just
it's a regular oh no oh oh little bouncy
bushes um I have played Psychonauts and
I did not much care for Psychonauts oh
oh look at that
now that's a jams a lot of people praise
Psychonauts
and I to be honest with you so and
understand why the entire game was
nothing but tutorials in every single
level was a different game that was a
tutorial level on before it it was
really frustrating to Tim Schafer's
masterpieces confederal and I will play
that as soon as it comes out from Evita
oh my god there's a ghostie
that's really neat I like that oh nice
bt-dubs bacon has bombs oh you fucked up
now Oh waist yeah yeah was rich yeah oh
no Psychonauts was a really like the
story and the characters in the setting
was a really fun idea I really enjoyed
that but the game of the video okay
that's where I have my problem ah that's
where the fault in it was but like no
the characters were really fun the story
was really nice but I just I got really
oh oh ah Monkey Island you know like a
lot of the old adventure games I did not
play oh you damned soul Oh cuz I can't
get up there now because I'm just ready
to go fast enough for now now yeah ah
fuck I did not play a lot of the old
adventure games because I did not have a
I didn't play many computer games
growing up didn't have a computer on the
farm oh my god
so you know
yeah I know I hear really good things
about like monkey island my a my only my
only dip into adventure games pre a
couple years ago was the NES version of
maniac mansion which is a terrible
version terribly NES version ok the NES
version is a terrible way is a terrible
system to play an adventure game on
instead of a mouse you have to know the
cursor was hurt with the with the with
the d-pad and that is no way to play an
adventure game so I'm sure that that
ruined adventure games for a lot of
people food that was their first fuck
yeah dog no PC for farmer I know we did
not have a computer we did not have a
computer on the farm oh my god see
anything that's the fish tick
Polly shores son-in-law is worth based
on Jack Packard's life yeah
I've seen that movie that's Jack my
girlfriend wants to know if you came
from Russia no I did not come from
Russia
what would make somebody think you came
from Russia I have no idea there's
something I can put them on here let's
see here
back I know I'm sure I would like monkey
island I've I've I've tried getting into
adventure games now as an adult that I
like a lot of them but she hated the
walking dead game
I haven't played I'm sure I'm going to
hate the walking dead game thought you
said you hated it I I played a little
bit of the walking dead game and I'm
sure I'm gonna hate it I actually want
to play it I want to play the walking
dead game to make sure that I'm going to
hit because if if the little bit I
played and what I've heard is any
indication there is very little game to
the walking dead yeah and I like games
I don't like story I mean I like story
stories a nice addition to a game but
there's gonna be more than one type of
game Jackson but then don't call it a
game call it a caller to choose your own
adventure novel that's you know like
it's not a game they probably don't know
what else to call it actually do mean
calling in and I said I have no idea
maybe they're calling in
so you're talking all this shit but I
know it so I want to play it
Bal mama I I can't just ban you if you
keep spamming this is the thing I've
been I've been gleefully ignoring you
and so we can you can't have a job you
said you stopped but yeah we're not just
gonna give you a job
you just sent us a tape right thank you
thank you
Alabama ah so that is all thank you
let's see a visual novel if it's called
the visual novel if the Walking Dead is
called a visual novel like then I just
don't give a fuck about visual novels
and then I'll be fine with that
am I trying to define art I am trying to
do well you know I'm doing I'm trying to
define art categories right a theater is
an art it's an art I don't much care for
and so I know going in I probably won't
like going to the theater that's just
one of those things
so you know visual novels I probably
won't like like Phoenix right at least
has a little bit of challenge to it like
you have to figure stuff out what was
the other one professor layton I really
dug that Professor Layton game but I
mean those are those are puzzles so
that's kind of a different thing pick a
choice the game exactly Asians Iran -
Tron hmm not my kind of thing
Wow why do I hate the fan so much that
you can't even give them a job you fraud
it's true it's true
I hate everything and everyone like I've
mentioned many times not my call okay
five Alabama
maybe if I can ban you yep there we go
bye okay let's move on now
patek confirmed freighter absolutely
everyone I think I think I just gave him
I gave them enough warnings let's see
here
am i the heir apparent to HP's company
in Fortune mr. Packard no I have nothing
to do with the Hewlett Packard
corporation I have nothing to do with
the Packard automobile and if anyone has
ever been to cut a--have I have nothing
to do with Packard Avenue those are the
kind of things that people ask oh you're
you're waiting alone isn't enough huh
finding these little platforms to go up
and down ah that's just me standing at
it it doesn't move you mean an enemy on
there oh that's cool things but an enemy
or one of those see all the skulls that
they drive can you move that thing
that's skull ah try that seems that
seems to weigh it down
Obama says you're welcome Jack what
games you have 500 hundred hours in
according to steam I have 900 hours in
Team Fortress 2 I don't have 500 hours
in any game rich well at 500 hours of
the XCOM yeah rich as may be thinking of
X comma I'm a fucking psychopath 4x yeah
so I probably had 500 hours of Team
Fortress 2 on my old xbox360 before I
got steam before steam was on Mac but
now you know that's how we do it I can't
you can well I'm so back I'm sorry I'm
just laughing at the chat oh let's see
here 900 yeah 900 hours is a lot into
Team Fortress 2 but I really like it
it's my favorite game
it's the game I have more more fun in
than any other game and and yes a lot of
people have way more hours in that into
dota 2 so we have a phase lock it now
give a 100 so you can like oh nice we
switched between the magical items no is
there a start
yeah oh start nice nice
rich has not tried Zeena not yet but he
wants to yes going he has it and he's
going to started suing I have to replay
XCOM in a month I'm starting month 5 3

was going to - oh yeah oh yeah it was
going for me no yeah I do
I haven't got a chance to play with many
of the new weapons in the Team Fortress
2 update yet I'm looking forward to
getting some of them the the the
parachute looks really fun and oh and
the new Demoman shield I like demoknight
demoknights a really fun class and so
I'm looking forward to messing around to
do new Demoman shield so whoo that's a
good question Kellis m8 jack fuck marry
kill
rich Jay and Xena Warrior Princess
I would like to fuck and marry Xena
Warrior Princess and kill both Richard
yes that's the only answer Lucy Lawless
is my jam as far as I'm concerned she is
both my Jimmy and my jam all you might
be able to jump on that
no no that's weird Scotty another oh oh
look at that
yeah demoknights just one of those
stupid classes that like it's not a real
class still the Knights are kind of a
fuck nut class but I love him let's see
here
sorry rich have you ever reloaded an X
come save out of sheer frustration oh no
no I'm pretty good about salty Pope you
know even when I'm working you know
Ironman mode when the game first came
out Jack
I'm glitchy as hell okay there's a lot
of bugs next time so ice I didn't like
Iron Man but I self-imposing but my god
like I got like a glitch Midway during a
level uh-huh then I had real or say sure
and I got a glitch but I stole otherwise
I don't like reloading safe all right so
you win again you and hardcore you might
win hurt Howard in when I didn't have
too nice good man good man I given up
some games in frustration
Jack what do you think about the tf2
shorts especially the last one about
Brent they're all fun they're all super
fun and more so if anyone doesn't know
valve makes all of their animated tf2
shorts in a program called source
filmmaker which gives you access to all
of the which is free animation software
the valve right now we'll give you free
animation software there's no pile of
gold um oh damn I just got there come on
in full o 4 so it's free animation
software for 3d stuff mostly using the
Team Fortress 2 characters but you can
import other characters it's free
animation software that anyone can use
and people have made amazing stuff with
source filmmaker and so yeah I think
they're all good you know ok
back back to X numbers because I'm
thinking about we're talking on
reloading safes now there was one time
when I was reloading save or now well I
was I was specifically recreating the GI
Joes hmm and I wasn't so much playing
the play as much as I was just trying to
level up different characters so it's
like you know Snake Eyes would die
intermission yeah restart that driller
their code names the nicknames are the
GI Joe name okay and I put in the real
name was like the back of the file card
for Snake Eyes I actually put in flake
first name - - - last name classified
because they never give you snake eyes
and I'm with a character Chris I gotta
have a look as much as I could like the
character that's awesome yeah that's
really funny Oh Oh your face inspector
name
XCOM would be the basis for a great Jo
game it really wouldn't replace the
aliens with generic Cobra soldiers
absolutely I would play the fuck out of
that I'm sure there's a mod make it
happen make an ex-con GI Joe mod like
the sec toys would be those those
generic over troopers would like though
the mask over there their mouth I like
it sorry yeah you got out of it you got
out of it odd mutation fuck marry kill
transformers 1 2 & 3
I've only seen transport what does it
matter I mean basically the same I've
only seen the first one and I use guys
nasty all money god that's guys so bad I
love it yeah I mean you're probably
gonna die okay pull those up on this ha
drat oh god damn it
there's an ex-con Xena Warrior Princess
what I would totally play that oh my god
XCOM space cop wait we should make space
tell the difference yes by the way yes
balls are your friend no what's your
favorite Michael Bay movie The Rock The
Rock is great everyone knows that the
rock is great
aye but you're bad boys I enjoy both of
them of the bad-boy movies it's what we
were what we were talking about with
Leon sssss and in the interview before
the stream was that Michael Bay used to
be a fine Prevert of schlock and
somewhere along the line he started to
mess up his own movies and I liked it
when they were just mindless schlock
like the rock his beautiful mindless
schlock bad boys is dumb dumb schlock
and I loved every second of it but uh
you know once you start getting to
Transformers and you can't once you
can't tell who's blowing up who and then
it starts getting bad but in the rock I
knew exactly who is blowing up whom
everyone was blowing about the trusted
by the way is the answer right now
not anymore spoke too soon
oh my god no what do you mean I like the
rocket I don't care I don't care nothing
about none all right here we go
oh right Edie Harrison the rock was
awesome oh I'm sorry to do this beats

can't watch uh watch what I'm fucking
doing here I'll watch it in the stream

the way what does it mean when you say
based based yeah I don't know what that
means what does it mean when you say

was that
I mean Jessi's usually the voice of
reason up and around here I try did you
use the skeleton oh now you know I found
a treasure thing that I can go through

learn stuff
Jimmy's dams bad oh yes this game is to
shoot my brothers 3 what Binding of
Isaac is to Legend of Zelda Absa that is

not beyond not doing the dance Jack you
shouldn't die
oh yes that's what I was saying guys I
told you to dig faster is set to dig
slower well I assume that there's no
girl named Justin so that's why I'm not
assuming that everyone in here is that
they're all guys so someone named Justin
I can probably assume that it's a guy I
mean Justin is it a man's name yeah
I'm sorry if I offended anybody um Oh
spike skill even right away that's good
to know ya know you just out of juice
yeah that's all right
70% of your female doubted I've seen our
even our stats before I pay attention in
YouTube statistics
I know what's going on most of the time
oh it's flow to read
how did Harry fucking rat know there's
problems with girls here I know there
are girls like in life in general yeah
that helps it was just een then they
spelled their name wrong that was the
saying Justin I mean yeah that's funny

are getting there
treasure with sauna - oh fuck you game
well you have to say it if you're
laughing look uh I'm sorry I'm sorry
Jessi is funding some of the chat
amusing so congratulations
congratulations to whatever whomever is
making Jessi Diego someone said to stop
Jimmy jammin Oh Jimmy Jam too much I'm
sorry everyone
and I killed the checkpoint I need to
stop I need to stop killing with
checkpoint I'm sorry everyone I'm
failing but for in my defense rich Evans
has been playing for the past seven so
you need to jump on the platforms and
the spikes are bad yes I have noticed
that thank you
to whomever pointed that out yeah
avoiding spikes is basically basically
try not to die that's that's my strategy
right now is I'm trying to attempting to
stay alive me to UM we're gonna be good
eat well you get that and you need to
kind of be you know medium digging and
ease up on the Jimmy James so it's
totally necessary that's me that I'm
giving you this advice yeah you're
saying he's up on the Jimmy dams just
until it's the right time sure you are
all right dad you know what that's fair
that's fair I don't wanna turkey
okay now we're getting back into it no
this guy what is that guy I'm supposed
to tell you that if you remove the
skeleton that you move faster now that
I'm another joke I do think it's kind of
funny yep
that was during our Dark Soul stream uh
we were asking for people to help us cuz
we were dying so often yeah and people
were telling us to remove skeleton which
is not something you can do in Dark
Souls uh you got Jimmy jammed oh my god
what I don't know that's did someone say
that no that's me okay

am not killing it but I'm doing my guys
I'm doing my best
Oh removed jack playing poorly you're

small with the bus that large see guys
