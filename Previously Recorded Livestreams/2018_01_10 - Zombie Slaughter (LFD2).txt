that's all like that's how I feel
playing this thing
peach with the back of my gun that's
what I'm gonna do
do you only fight Emma on the safer
maybe that's a question for someone who
plays the game more than I do
you afraid to use my gun too much for
the big bosses yeah I want to use my
shit
reloading that's why I picked up the
handgun and in lieu of a melee weapon
heads up
I'm reloading

give you some adrenaline hey wait wait
wait wait wait no oh sorry damn it I
give it to myself
okay that's a scary gargoyle
looks like a slaughter reloading
then I'd be the best stream game being
awful damn quiet what is this
it's quiet I'm being aqua what do mean
we're not talking much well that's the
sake of entertaining the people we are
we are into the game rich is the problem
reloading you know not like I found that
problem a little bit with pub g2 pub G
has a pub he's got a lot more after it
does but then you know like during this
at those certain moments you need to be
quiet this though really he's just too
into it boys you don't have the quiet
ones yeah something's always about to
pop up behind you it's true do we know
where we're supposed to be done no I
haven't known since we're starting great
great then we're doing great
then we're doing great rich I'm taking
the follow the people who seem like
they've played this before
it's pretty good approach hey we did it
if they played it more they wouldn't
have to come straight as hard and katalk
more that's that's the truth that's the
trueness that's the truth fall ah city
whoo-hoo that is an intense game let's
take this moment here yeah sister Ling
says I've been pleasantly surprised but
pleasantly well he says presently
surprised by the Orval it's pretty
alright and could be great with some
tinkering is there any of the humor that
you liked and you love you guns was
there humor in the Orval that you liked
joke wasn't terrible ok I don't mind the
lighter tone in general just a lot of
the jokes they literally feel tacked on
yeah yeah I agree with that I absolutely
agree with that look I like the show you
like the Orval I look forward to new
episodes of the Orval ok so yeah I know
it's just not my thing
there's there I think there's also just
a lot of bad jokes just so I can
generally hear what's going on I think
that's a problem but it's just there's a
lot of jokes a lot of jokes referencing
pop culture from our time we will drive
out of here
do this but in these circumstances I
think mr. Gibbs two people go and
collect gas and throw it down and two
people stay on the bottom level these
days a car shows so we don't have to
hide I'll go up rich you sit down you
sit down okay you're gonna guess they'll
get the gas once you put one in good
okay they're zombies are gonna start oh
I guess jack is going up I'll go with
them you guys stay down
second zombie whoa shit
so simple so we guess if the cars that
the that's the bit we got to get the gas
cans you bring it back to the car bang
rushman eight thirteen thirteen oh wow
we still need ten more what
reloading thank you
I thought I could jump over the edge and
bring the gas going down what
I got some ammo right here get upstairs
more reloading there's more stairs ammo
here reloading okay okay okay
more gas working on it run-run gas cans
down on the ground level
do it you can do it
let me help there get to come back as a
zombie
ha ha ha do you know so good no I'm the
dead one I feel bad now well you you
might not be the only dead one
but she shouldn't running spit dude look
I literally never played this game
before I have no idea how dangerous that
is figured it wasn't good
oh shit he just threw a rock at me
but I wasn't planning on staying the
forever I just good for gas and real
quick come on come on I'm coming
No
shit
shit oh shit oh shit move my legs oh
sorry I'm shooting you now
man
we both dead all right what's the plan
is it took us so long to get this up and
running are we done yeah we are we got
one we got one man we get let's see here
what do we got here oh it's not been a
good night for baby huh
it has not been a good gaming night it
has not been and I'm really sorry about
that we're gonna pick it back up though
all right we're gonna pick it back up
all right crazy Nate 99 says love the
Christmas best of the worst I think
makers of Oh what was that what was the
night oh oh night of the kick fighters
cast Adam West in the lead and Andy
Bowman as his stunt double when he saw
look what a team player I was Jack look
at that rescued most teammates 22 hey we
did it
amazing 22 percent 22% of all rescues
and we killed 1400 zombies that's good
let's see here I think Adam West was
casting lead in Antibes almond as stunt
double but when West saw what a shit
show it was he would only cameo and Andy
got promoted thoughts I think who was
cameo in what went in the where the the
idea is that that they originally cast
Adam West in the lead and Andy bumming
was just his stunt double okay but then
Adam West decided not to do it sorry
Andy Bauman said I'll do it I think
though Andy Bauman had what a producer
credit or a writer quite at credit yeah
maybe even a writer credit so I think
Andy Bauman this his intention was to
star in it that's that was definitely
his intention so no I don't think that
was that I just think they couldn't
afford Adam West for the entire movie
which is not far more likely Jenelle
82 says really love your stuff have you
guys played darkest dungeon if so any
chance for a steam slash review thanks
guys
you played darkest dungeon on stream a
little bit and I've played actually a
bunch of it since then I really liked it
I don't know if it would make for the
best stream maybe we could one of these
days I think I have it well I have it on
my Vita and so play which I might be
able to play it through the ps4 but yeah
it's fine it got a little it got a
little too managed e for me you know
what what I would do is I would spend
like it was my Vita game and so I would
spend like a half hour just getting all
my guys set up but then I'd have to like
stop playing and you know go do whatever
and then like by the time I came to
actually go in the dungeon I forgot what
guys I had set up for what and but like
overall I did enjoy it but it just got a
little too managee for me for a handheld
game you need a spreadsheet I mean I
needed a spreadsheet I needed like a
little reminder all the stuff I did or I
just needed to sit down and actually
play it for a good couple of hours not a
half hour chunk like I was yeah yeah but
I enjoyed it for the most part and
whisker cuddles says Jack I've lost 10
kilograms I don't know what a kilo gram
is metric I like I cannot I know it's
metric I cannot visualize a kilogram but
congratulations and I ate chocolate
every day because I fit it in my diet
and gym five days a week how is your
diet and weight loss going what is your
workout routine now that the holidays
are over I'm back in at full swing and
you know I'm so far so good
no workout routine yet I'm just
concentrating and losing so I'm just
concentrating on diet at the moment but
thank you
oh the chat is saying 10 kilograms is
approximately 22 pounds well
congratulations that's quite a bit of
weight are we going to play this again
I'd love them to survive we'll do
another night I'll bring in my computer
do pub G and this thing with it all set
up ahead of time with those server
issues no download time it'll be great I
think though like the longer we streamed
the more likely another thing is gonna
go wrong
yeah so I want to I want to cut and run
oh yeah yeah I'm fine I'm fine leaving
now I'm fine it's looking like it
started six ish no seven ish who started
at seven all right great boink boink hey
now is the time in which we thank all
the people who subscribe to us during
this very stream and to do that we chant
I believe we just read all the tips
we're caught up in tips right I believe
yeah but I can double check
Oh actually we had just one more come
just this very second from true-blue
review who says hey guys I just got back
from a Manhattan screening of the room
mm-hmm
what are your thoughts on the movie have
you ever gone to a screening of a
popular bad movie is it too popular for
a review the screenings are how I found
it Rover I was dragged to a screening oh
yeah yeah you know and I just recently
saw it I used to I've been to a couple
midnight showings of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show the classic classic good
bad movie I think I think the Rocky
Horror Picture Show might be a little
bit too cult-like for me
Cole tonight oh yeah the specific things
the specific time but that's what the
room is
yes God that way with uh some of the
stuff yeah well I went is a bit more
free for me sure sure I think that's how
it goes like there's this thing when I
went to be fest they play at midnight
every year plan 9 from outer space and
they have their own crazy ritual as well
they throw it you know during the the
saucer scene they throw a paper plates
like they they have a whole they have a
whole stick yeah yeah and it can be
intimidating it can be intimidating and
I don't necessarily think that that
would be the most ideal time to watch a
movie for the first time but people who
go to those things are obnoxious maybe
I'm just jaded I think it can be like
like what weren't you saying when when
when there is a when there is an
audience participation that you don't
know of then it's it just adds to the
confusion and it's an already bad movie
and then people are like yelling things
all in harmony as if they had practiced
well what killed the room screenings up
here too many people went it was just
too much chaos sure too loud and you
like it'd be a terrible way to see the
movie for the first time now yeah yeah
agreed
everyone wants to get their joking yeah
yeah yeah I hold on I got to grab a
couple things then we're gonna thank
people it's probably better to see the
room with a small group of friends yes
but I mean isn't that always the case
is it is it really technical difficult
this isn't really our fault
when pub G takes their fucking servers
down for the four hours we stream
technically it's our fault because if we
were true professionals rich yeah we
would have checked to make sure the
servers how often do you expect the
server's to be down that specific time
and it's our fault because then we
wanted to download something and it was
completely our fault oh yeah so so
probably there were the also I think the
room is big enough now where if you want
more information on the room it's out
there there are videos already made I
can't imagine we would have anything to
add at this point yeah it's probably not
gonna happen no I wouldn't imagine so
it's just it's there's just so much out
there you don't need us you just don't
need us
all right hey here it is it's the time
rich we're gonna thank we're gonna
thanks nuke master 20 Queen of the One
Ring

the killcam yeah that's that's a big
upgrade yeah it's actually a big upgrade
it's like shockingly like for just for
one little change it's a
it is it is because every match you
stand like what was that bullshit right
what was that on her bullshit then you
can watch the replay you can be like
okay oh that guy kill me all right I
mean sometimes still bullshitting but at
least you know where the bullshit came
you can learn what you're doing wrong
and that's an important change I think
yeah yes do tur turn basically basically
it's not my favorite yeah but I've
warmed up to it a lot since we talked
about it officially which is the problem
with early access cuz we were only
talking about it with earlier but now
the game's officially has is different
you can do an official win today we can
do an official you really want I don't
know if it's necessary turd smuggling's
who says thanks for all the
entertainment you fucks I still never
play it alone that's why I'm G I would
never play it alone miserable term
smugglin and now it's time to go fuck

just to fuck with that person go doubt
doubt kitten where did we Opie
train 11 435 fucking months in a row
who says Karen giving no fucks about
over-talking riches Jason kill is sweet
payback for every time rich
inadvertently shout interrupts a good
70% of Jack stories absolutely
absolutely I'll take it a shot because
it's something that happened in the game
it is it is gaming stream come on let's
be honest let's be honest why did you
see my Twitter joke today the the
Twitter joke for when I said when was
extremely I said we're just gonna
livestream our cooling fan o as we mined
for cryptocurrency yeah it was like
that's that could be a stream I'll just
put out the fan on and we'll talk we'll
get like 2 bucks worth of cryptocurrency
there are a lot of money to be made in
mining Bitcoin how do you mind Bitcoin
how does that work you need to do your
computer needs to do a certain a very
large and arduous and time-consuming
math problem yeah and so you need a big
like you know the companies that do it
use their big like computer farm yeah
what does this do it gives you a crypto
money's how just free money's doing
nothing
well it takes energy and power isn't
this a huge flaw in Bitcoin if anybody
can just generate their own bitcoins no
I'm also like I'm basing all of the
information I'm giving you rich off of
like half of an NPR interview I listen
two months ago I'm very curious on how
this works
yeah I'm legit curious on the Bitcoin
mining okay and wouldn't this devalue
the Bitcoin if anybody can just mine for
bitcoins but just turning a computer on
I believe I believe the amount that you
can mine based off of current computer
hardware is low enough where the answer
is no but you also need to be able to
generate currency in some way right I
I don't know enough about this I don't
know enough about this and and yes Satan
preached you says that's why bitcoins
are worth different amounts of money per
minute well also because their perceived
value is a it's a whole it's a whole
thing
I'm just wondering with the legalities
of it okay cuz it's not legal tender can
can you go to jail jail for stealing
bitcoins is it technically illegal yeah
because it's still you're still stealing
something of value okay
the the problem would be the the victim
would have to prove what value it was
and how it was stolen right it's still
it's still something valuable right
several companies have done it it's
considered property by the IRS oh man

Seinfeld quote or episode is different
really have like a favorite individual
episode right it's just the whole thing
you ever read the the the script the
9/11 episode yes yes I have and it's
brilliant and it's perfect Seinfeld
that's the thing just like any out you
can just tell us on any episode okay off
the top of my head here's what I can
think of I remember the episode where
Jerry goes to the Pakistani restaurant
yeah and they don't have any Pakistani
food there he goes to the restaurant
owned by a Pakistani man okay but they
don't remember that one specifically but
they don't serve any Pakistan foods like
you know I'd kind of like to try some
Pakistani food and then he the
restaurant owner decides to change the
entire restaurant to be a
particularly Pakistani oh that was that
was that the one with the restaurant
across the street it wasn't doing well
advice and what he should have done and
then it failed harder that's a good one
that is that's a great one a lot of good
ones but I mean that's the thing like
you could just say that about anyone
George is deciding to do the opposite of
what he always does and it working off
spectacularly well for him against job
work for the Yankees and girlfriends
does the opposite of whatever he would
normally do right that was a neat
episode the one where George pretends to
be a tourist I don't think I saw that
one it's one where George pretends like
he somehow puts on some funny closer he
like has a map of New York
yeah and a very pretty lady who works
for the New York Board of tourism
decides to help him because he's
obviously a tourist yeah and he just
goes along with it to get the pretty
lady to help him and then just keeps
pretending he's a tourist and he says
everyone's so nice to me when I'm a
tourist that's a that's a great one I
need to revisit Seinfeld right just put
it out in the background old Chris for
39 motherfucking months in a row and to
