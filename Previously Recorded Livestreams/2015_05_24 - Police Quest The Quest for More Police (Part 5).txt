all right hands up currently we're not
bothering with anything else now no no
on the ground I don't know about this I
don't know about this I don't like this
at all this is not following me ever
safe okay
all right you did it move it dickhead Oh
son of a what do you think I meant by
talk to him oh is it too late yep too
late by the way the first ring finger
part about that is the game told you not
to follow all the other yeah exactly
exactly
the game was leading you down a path of
not following police procedures right
good god damn it
this pissed-off mofo says while this
game blows we've had more fun with this
than we have it a lot of games recently
I don't know what the fuck you're
talking about we're figuring out puzzles
we have funny voices going on
this shit's great but what else do you
want we have funny voices what else
could you possibly want this is how we
do it
this is how we do it it's fun here but
playing this by yourself would be
depressing okay you know no it's
different so much is that's depressing
so what fine
suppressing no no I think there's a
charm to it look keep walking like that
I love it okay
holster weapon cuff him read more read
writes carefully admonish your suspect
of his despised Miranda rights you have
the right to remain silent what you say
may be used against you in a court of
law you have the right to an attorney
you cannot afford an attorney one will
be appointed to represent you before
questioning if you wish all right get
down to the ground scumbag now bite that
curb tsums is reluctant but cooperative
you learn he has been selling to kids in
Jefferson High School including officer
Cobbs daughter Cathy dog don't know not
my Cathy search man which feels nothing
except for school ID card this said she
feels nothing except for this bug school
ID card and the small bag tin a white
powdery substance
you watched him get from the butcher
this dickhead kid been pushing drugs at
the local high school off so glad let's
kick his ass
time to bite the curb and stomp down on
at American History X style get out of
here fellow Sims to the patrol guy
whereas what what took you so long hot
rod I picked up this loose in trying to
take foot bail on you what is he this is
not a real thing
mumble under your breath yeah shit you
probably didn't grab the first white man
you good fun he was bailing out on foot
I know but foot bail seems like a weird
term you could just say he was bailing
or he was footing it you know like foot
bail seems weird
Oh apparently foot bail is specific
slang just for running from the cops oh
okay bye from a guy named Jose Martinez
but then Martinez introduced me to Don
Colby here some says I haven't seen
Martinez sense oh how can you do that
hello look some my Tina's I don't know I

police station do I have to get out and
check the car I'm gonna do it just in
case
well now you get into your own car right
yeah drive the undercover car to the bar
I'll do it I what the real question is
do you have to like shower and stuff but
I guess you're already in street clothes
some habits okay you're driving the
undercover car yeah Jesus Christ why not
I don't give a shit it's a perk it's a
perk
that's a perk all right I think you're
gonna get shit for that you saved
did you save yeah I did okay Oh God too
many white cars which ones you where is
the damn place not not there well I'm
the one that blew off because I'm always
the one that blows up right the place is
is off you were head in the right
direction generally we get the map let
me get the map back right in front of me
literally just it just turned directly
in front of me there's nothing I could
do
so you want a head to your right oh my
god another car turned right in front of
me so go up and right yeah good hey you
yielded I want to go around so I don't
get stopped at that fucking red light
sure down down down and then uh and then
take as soon as you can go right again
yeah that right Oh for fuck's sake
and yes favorite customer this game
right here police quest is another ps4
exclusive we're really enjoying the
graphical fidelity it has the makeups
but definitely tough to do all the
typing using the ps4 controller rich has
gotten pretty good at it no now you're
here don't crash don't crash just tell
crash
this is one of the better Sierra games I
think I think this is fun
I love the quest for glory games but
there's some this is a grinding I love
it they like merged an adventure game
with a role-playing game
really so there's combat oh that's no
that's not why you play adventure game
yeah there's multiple solutions and you
can play as either a thief a magician or
like a warrior oh and every puzzle
there's like a thief II solution a
wizardly solution than a violent
solution that seems awesome yeah that
seems awesome very fond of that series
yet in the Blue Room Sajak seated at the
table he appears to be quite intoxicated
good it better not be a duty I've had so
much to drink I just don't know I don't
know what to do with my life oh my my
daughter and my and my wife trying to
Jed Jack you tell her about the victors
Sims arrests and how he was responsible
for selling dope at that high school
Sonny I really do appreciate you nailing
that filthy scumbag pusher but but I'm
afraid it might be too late although did
she OD g OD know my daughter Kathy is in
the intensive care ward over at little
General Hospital she's in a coma from a
drunk OD this is a light-hearted game
rich this does this write that line yeah
yeah this rides and inserts that line
there's nothing I can do that's you Oh
Sonny this there's nothing anyone can do
Sonny does not know how to deal with
human emotion
he's not good at that kind of thing he's
a hard edge copy
he's got no ruin his life for emotion
this game was directed by Christopher
Nolan bartender says for your
