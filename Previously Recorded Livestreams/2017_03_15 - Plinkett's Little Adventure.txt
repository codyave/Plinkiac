gameplay will always just be a bad game
yes okay yeah I'm with you no matter how
good the story is if the gameplay is
clunky it's going to be clunky at that
point you're just working with the wrong
medium yes
I'm with you 100 100 Oh rich oh one
piston Hondo percent one piston Hondo I
just realized something I did wrong as a
mistake
I don't get to choose the game we're
playing but that's fine that's fine
that's fine hey everybody hi welcome hi
welcome welcome welcome back welcome
back and welcome to informational firm
ations update of great how's everybody
doing how's everybody happened having
fun
how's everybody have fun havin fun havin
guys I love I love the mini version of
this advise you gets yeah yeah I squeeze
gets of gaps hmm what is this a rerun no
this is a new blanket Advent little
adventure game we played this a long
time ago their first games same the same
people the this is also one of the
persons did a fantastic animated they
did the FTL flak cannon animations they
did a terminator commentary track
animation can barely hear the game audio
it's probably best for now because uh
it's just well they're gonna hear the
steam turn up crank it up crank it up
pause pause for cranking
pop that here this is Craig Jack is
louder than rich for once whatever they
have my mic further away from my face
and I just pushed my my further away so
now we should be approximately even
right maybe maybe rich ok well let's
let's start playing the game
give us that sweet pity I don't have it
we didn't make this you need to who made
this do you know your handle is for the
real name if they make such a thing
available I'm gonna head over to itch
you can go get this at HIO
right now if you go to H dot IO and
search Plunkett this is something
that'll come up it is a free game as it
should be because it uses this catheter
in character so if it the did check for
it we would have undo problem let's see

reason we didn't stream on Sunday was
because we had a big shoot weekend and I
was hoping we would have a little more
time on the weekend can you - in -
people ask me a question
I was hoping we'd have a little more
time in the weekend for them to play it
as well unfortunately we did not have a
lot of time how's that that was a
intense weekend oh we had the the
weekend of all weekends oh yeah we can't
talk about any of it unfortunately I
wish lots of things going on
lots of things going on just know that
things are being worked on many a thing
is being worked on it could be a rocket

thing
greater of the same view I have no idea
up here in the chat I don't know if they
have a twitch handball or what it would
be my tooth hurts rich tooth hurts I had
a root canal four years ago everybody
and apparently the dentist did not get
all the roots and it's coming back I
need a new root canal and it's starting
to flare up I was barren seeing intense
pain in my tooth at this exact moment so
what you're saying is we're gonna we're
having a great time for anyone who just
wants to see Jack and pain don't you

don't get yourselves a tasty beverage
and toast to the Bears releasing Jay
Cutler Congrats rich oh my god it's a
flying saucer
jump and shoot the saucer okay great
great absolutely insane
terrible thing we did years ago popular
no we can't escape it
nope never never go away never hey rich
since Mike and you are from Chicago and
Jay is from Wisconsin why did they
decide to base our Lynn Mowat in
Milwaukee instead of Illinois tax breaks
beer women whether I have no fucking
idea I wasn't involved with that
decision-making
um Jay wasn't right I think was from
Raqqa which Illinois dr. ellby was born
there he just lived there for a while
but at the time like Harlem started
doing stuff they were all living up here
mm-hmm
you know like when they were making
Internet videos they were being made up
here so they moved before you know it
was a thing he's I guess what I'm saying
who they were up here before I joined
them up here and at that time I never
really asked them why they came up here
so you know take care of your mouth
we're gonna see what happens Jacket is
root canal how's everyone doing
I am it a good night oh I think in the
chat all there in the chat yeah the game
is cute I like it
I approve here I'm gonna pick it up and
start playing fuck jack fuck jacket is
tooth you don't care about no tooth
resumed
so many realtor rods and references
yep
honey monkey man yep
oh that smarts
Oh
yeah
so normally molars have three nerves and
then three roots that you know when you
get a root canal they take care of the
three up apparently my mole is a little
special and I have four and the dentists
missed it years ago when I had my
bootcamp and and it just got infected
and it hurts like a motherfucker and I
started taking antibiotics yesterday and
every once in a while it'll just flare
up and the immense amount of pain and
you know it's not like it's not like
like you put a bandaid on right right
there's a letter on the ground maybe I
should read it perhaps
darris blinkered I've captured your
friends if you want to see them again
come to the mall what mall you may ask
you know damn well what mall I'm talking
about see you soon part two
Oh john-boy I'm jamming my robots
straight perfect for eggs
can you yeah I know I have an
appointment to get a fix in I'm on
antibiotics and as soon as the
antibiotics start to kick in the
infection should go away and I should
stop being in constant pain also the
antibiotics that I got apparently
there's a 10% chance that it just won't
work on me so you just got to wait and
see hope forward
so just took some ibuprofen in about 20
minutes this should settle down I'm
hoping we'll see if the beer kicks in
any faster I love the chopping mall
robots what mall shopping what
shopping malls on Amazon Prime right now
very tempted to watch you should you
should
you're the important question to you on
an electric kettle I do own an electric
kettle I use it to make coffee every day
and I love it it works great and it
heats up water really really well
I'm not drinking enough beer where it it
would it where it would affect my would
affect any of my antibiotics I'm just
having a beer
issues the hardest yeah
I have not watched doomed yet I'm
tempted just to watch it on my own
yeah we're waiting for it was everybody
watch it to date we were hoping for a
group effort but like that'll have to be
pushed back to cousin secret projects
and now we just we just filmed the Zelda
the best of the worst discussion and so
that'll take some time
Oh Martin it's paul Blart
some great rich you were doing great
this held up best of the worst zelda
breath of the wild which shares the same
acronyms as best work
whoa nice
it's morphin time i see that they a
switch right now is running a Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers marathon yeah I
think it's fantastic hype for the new
movie I think it's great that switches
doing stuff like this they did they did
that for a Samurai Jack they they did a
marathon of all the old Samurai Jack
episodes before the new one came on
there they're getting into it they're
getting into some weird stuff yeah new
new series came up I think only one
episodes out so far and I haven't seen
it on core 200 danny paul blart samurai
jack is back that's true
hmm
I'm excited for because of the twitch
enthusiasm well that's that's part of it
like which is which is embracing their
role as basically like community hub and
so they say a bunch of people are gonna
be talking about Power Rangers well give
them a will give them a hub to just talk
about Power Rangers I guess the power's
out again Robert cotton how did he sound
sure or better stay close or don't error
or whatever oh oh he's a helper robot
that's fantastic
sobbing but I guess he didn't quit nope
I think it's great that you get a little
halter
awful robot got Robert cop was great I
think that's what we call them Robert
the robot cop
this is a neat as fuck game yeah it's
it's neat it's great these guys made a
pretty fun little blanket game someone
will have to go down there to turn the
power on mmm good luck whatever I need a
new job tip I control access to anything
and everything I know what that is
I say there's no way you can defeat in
your brain
you can't defeat me a brain rich what
what
we can't shoot his ball sack
I think he's there just as a distraction
yeah I think unless you can you jump
over him
I've tried a camera can you zoom past
him and Rajesh
if they cared about Neal Breen
continuity you wouldn't be able to beat
him you know and it's just about
destroying the robots while he distracts
I don't know the question is do the
creators of this game care about Neal
Breen continuity that's a real question
nice suing it survived survived
let's see here
let's see here Tomic mousetrap says
there was something I was supposed to
tell Caesar about today but I can't
remember what it was probably not
important maybe Ides of March 15th yep
today's the Ides of March beware beware
the Ides of March oh it's so beautiful
oh my god are we gonna sleep Green's
ballsack oh no oh the hell was that oh
my god even Lord David says hey Jack
David here sorry about your tooth pain
I'm gonna need a root canal soon and I'm
not looking forward to it put the two
bucks towards a better dentist uh you
know what my Oh ever had one I have
teeth made out of cast iron first of all
that's great I think those are feeding
frenzy
Bob you Lloyd
maybe no my dentist is actually really
cool about it
oh those things yeah he did this root
canal four years ago and I came back
today with tooth pain and he's gonna
take care of the new root canal of note
two for no charge
he's like I fucked up four years ago you
know didn't see it and so I was like
that's incredibly cool of a dentist so
he's a fine dentist is just a fluke
accident
are you rich oh shit
spikes their spikes there are spikes in
this game
better than the first one this is
qualities good quality glad fuckin yeah
yeah you've really stepped up your game
since the first one let's see here dr.
doom it up says fuck me I just started
watching TOS the original series yeah I
can finally understand what rich and
Mike are talking about so far every
episode has been oh no a crew member got
infected and is now in danger to the
ship for years would it really take that
long to notice well it just got infected
you know route all they doing with the
root canals they literally like burn off
the the the nerve endings to your tooth
and so there was an unnoticed nerve
ending that wasn't causing me problems
years ago but started causing me
problems recently that's how it works
sometimes teeth are weird I have bad
teeth in general
how cool is the dye shopping Zelda any
cool combinations you've done so far no
later on the dye shop much oh but that
was there I've seen it
space captain let's end this yeah space
come what's in this I I haven't played
around with the dye shop at all it might
not use my audio for like I'm actually
trying to give them clean audio oh I'm
sorry
good when I say shoot we end this at
Subway
oh he got me okay sorry no problem I
haven't messed around with the dye shop
mostly I I stick with the same outfit
and actually that's something we didn't
talk about in our discussion was was
outfits that's another part of the Zelda
that I didn't much care for the swapping
of outfits you know like there there's
an outfit that you get that makes you
climb faster there's an outfit that you
get for cold there's an outfit that you
get to get into Gerudo city there's all
these different outfits and I've never
much cared for switching all the outfits
because I liked by the way I love that
just shoot him whatever solution so
space cock and simply get so pointed
these people get the theme
whoa
let's see here
Jack LeMond says keep up the good work
you hack frauds any chance of rich doing
a review of Star Trek - I know that's
not gonna be the next one or maybe even
the next one after that oh whoa
G shots thank you for feeling my pain
tooth pain sucks tooth pain is like is
unlike any other any other bodily pain
can be dealt with but tooth pain tooth
pain just sticks with you and it feels
like your face is exploding sciatica you
can exercise away man tooth pain there's
nothing that you can do you stretch
stretch it out stretch it away
no no long-term solution yeah yeah
before then you have two months of
constant agony well then I would Chinee
it was the worst thing in my entire
fucking life then I would say we're
similar right now it feels like my head
is going to explode oh my god
it's race
oh my god
oh my god it's crazy you have any eggs
no I need eggs and need eggs that's
who's saying this oh I think that's
point good okay where are those two
fuckers Wyatt Wyatt Wyatt hey that's my
whip hey that's my wheelchair never back
you one-legged fuck no well you asked
for it always got a shield
watch out for a spike drop
Blayne hit versus blanket this is the
ultimate showdown here range blanket
versus stake blinken which is the real
fake that's the question I've made peace
pathetic
let's see here renegade Akira oh no
sorry krob says jack if you were to make
your package dispatched simulator game
what would you set it in ie what kinds
of packages to which clients you know
that could be that that's that's part
just part of the color you know like you
could have different packages and
different kind clients I could that's
where the humor and the story to come in
I know they they recently made like a
911 dispatcher game that I think is
similar and actually uses Google map API
so you can you can like do it in your
own City if you want to which i think is
really neat both which you're asking the
important questions
this is quality boss bike
whoa one-hit-kill nice matter respect to
whoever made this game really impressive
yeah yeah this is I remember that first
game that they made that first Plunkett
fan game that was just kind of yeah yeah
but I'm saying like this is really up
this is they have up there their game
making game I don't I love how he does
that stupid anime floaty thing yeah that
is funny he's got you know what like
quality animation to do an eye on all of
his strikes quality animation but yeah I
think prompted to finish a question it's
like like what kind of packages are
being delivered it would be neat where
the Schumer will come from you know Lady
Penelope needs her poodle taken to the
poodle dispensary it would be all sorts
of different stuff and we could have a
lot of fun Oh still alive still
please Jack the other person oh hey
Mikoto and the ck ovm is in the chat for
anyone who wants to talk to Mike Odom
about making blinken half in the bag
blanket versus other blanket
if we are going to be sticklers for
continuity we have to accept that movie
review Plunkett is fake blanket I just
because movie review Plunkett is more
popular does not mean he is the truth
blanket there was the other planket who
was around first
let's see here renegade akira-san hey
guys I know you're busy with Zelda and
the switch but are you going to give me
rock tamata
a chance it has tones of anime bullshit
to complain about
maybe stream on Sunday for the PC
version yes we were definitely waiting
for the PC version is to come up I know
it's been out on ps4 for a little bit
but her Aizen
yeah our last couple games that have
been very survival II Explorer II
adventurous out via you know what I'll
tell you it rich it'll be a welcome
change of pace no offense to either
horizon or Zelda but I'm ready for this
at straight-up action
now
Rich's Plunkett prime over there you go
now we're talking about it blankets and
different multiverses defeat my ultimate
attack yeah that's that's pretty that's
pretty awesome attack
this is a new year do a lot of good
stuff mean wise though I know I I don't
know if that was a question for me or
for other people in chat I'm excited to
play it it looks really interesting what
you really needs the new near of the
money Monica
I don't appear near I don't appear but
yeah gobble the coke says hey fellas I'm
sending this from my ten key classroom
it's like PE for nerves what's your
worst per minute ratio do you know you
type well I'm typing with my left hand
it's like the stranger you're a two
fingers like this I don't know what's
the two fingers famous oh okay
I use multiple fingers but I'm also I
have to look at the keyboard in order to
do it I can hunt and peck at this point
it's been so long I don't always have to
work thinking about it oh yeah okay I'm
a slow time for these lifts so that's
something I've talked about before if I
could go back in time and take it some
sort of typing class in high school I
would have I wish I was a better
tightness
and not a very good typist I wish I was
a touch typist and not that feature off
and some of the keys just like in
dueling those in tax
and like I know I know there's a bunch
of like teach yourself how to type tools
now including games but I'm just too old
now
Nikodim rich needs a hints oh you still
have still left Oh rich needs a hint
I'm living
there's two ways of avoiding that
attackers according to Mike Odom
yes thank you for the hints of getting
good
there are two ways to avoid
Nikodim is double-checking are you sure
you want anything okay
I think like you know there's that
moment that he attacks I think he you
have to jump for something right when he
does that there's that moment when he
glides towards you before he strikes
right so I'd say then is when you dash
away
let's see here anonymous says hey Jack
your taste in hip-hop is pretty advanced
what's your opinion on the deaf
I've never heard of him so
Oh
can you shoot him while he's charging
you were too far away at that time
have you tried out of time
Death Grips is not hip up oh well I
haven't heard of them no matter what but
what would it take to become an employee
of red letter media it's me I'm friend
in 2001 I was gonna say it's even
simpler than average you have to be Mike
jr. rich yeah so if you are or can
become Mike Jay or rich then you can be
an employee of Allah that's it that's
all you got to do I think it's pretty
simple
oh you know what what no he turned
around
going on the other side of them oh I
don't know actually I don't know
is cosplay count how about an intern I
want to say like when half and the bags
first started I want to say Mike and Jay
had an intern for like a week didn't
think they have a helper I thought I
remembered to help her and then he gave
up because you weren't here you you were
this was still when you were down in
Chicago
I want to I want to say there was like
an intern here and after the intern hope
not me goes that way all right
hey you know we're trying can you
interact with like the door or the cult
like can you interact with anything in
the scene in any way
take a life and see if he can like tip
over that
yeah well then then I got nothing rich
for trucks then or no okay
if I remember and he wasn't films dude
he was a film student and he asked for
an internship and like yeah sure you can
help out and he became so insanely bored
because there is not much to do right
we're making this a boring process it is
and you know
for the types of videos that are usually
made here while it would be great to
have someone behind the camera like I'd
also wouldn't want to spare anyone that
boredom just listening to us talk
unedited for hours
let's see here let's see bad news
everyone's his evening dudes how would
you say the way how would you say the
way a best of the worst episode is
produced from start to finish has
changed if at all over the year
you sometimes dread or typically look
forward to shooting no a super bank fart
bag not like right now right now this
gameplay footage to distract you rich
and I ever liked our boring there are
things here that you can that can
entertain you while rich and I are being
boring oh my god you shoot him while
he's attacking you rich something so
simple Oh
this is obviously you rich
rich we got to finish the review all
right so rich would you recommend this
game to anyone discussed games in quotes
this game you discussed so so rich would
you recommend this game to anyone what
this piece of shit and is that is that
Stewart Boogie great job guys yeah it's
a great song that's a great time yeah
you did it everyone let's continue
oh that's hardcore mode nice nope oh no
it just takes off from here so no I
really look forward to him I I really
like best of the worst it's it's a fun
day it's a hard day sometimes I in one
hit good luck asshole oh my god
it's it's usually a really long day but
I love it cuz you get to hang out with
your friends and make fun of bad movies
like what's what's to not love about it
to be quite honest I don't think
production has changed one bit since we
started I'm trying to think structures
used to happen right after this shoot
the what yeah we improvised whatever
crap brick on it hammer this is their
the studio we did a flight we finished
sure that never happens anymore right
it's usually a more planned out thing
alright I'm not on the last a hardcore
mode we're gonna give it a quick shot oh
yes give it a quick it's gonna be comedy
but I'm just trying to think from a
technical level
I don't think anything has changed in
vessel works production from the
beginning we have we have messed around
with the idea of some sort of note
taking there there's something that rich
and I used for the first four hours own
that is a you said that you've said a
thing after the I'm trying to think of
what I gotta think of what it's called
them I can tell you by the way I got to
know what the other way to dodge big
blankets attackers
I don't know I don't know how reliable
my method of getting good and just
sucking up the damage was
all right for the checkpoint
what is this a pulp no I don't know
either this explain what it does there
there is an Adobe app where you live
lager boom
Adobe live logger is an app for your
iPad that you can take notes and create
markers during a live shoot and so if
you have like an hour shoot but nothing
a lot happens during that hour you can
create markers that you can then import
into your timeline and know exactly when
the good live longer you can know
exactly when the good stuff happened and
so as an example for for the first four
hours of I leave that running running
because we know we shoot for four hours
and then every time we make a good joke
or if something else happens I can make
a little marker so then instead of
having to rewatch that entire four hours
worth of footage I can just go boom boom
boom there's all the funny stuff there's
all the interesting stuff and
it makes editing incredibly fast and we
have messed around with the idea of
using something like that for best of
the worst one of the real problems with
that though is you have to be out of the
moment for a second it's never gonna
happen is you have to stop watching the
movie and hit a button which means you
know you never get the marker right
where the joke is and you could always
miss a joke but uh so in theory if we
had you know like if or if one of us
would just remember to take notes
editing of best of the worst could be so
much faster cuz I know right now for for
them editing best of the worst going
through three full movies with us
talking and an hour and a half plus long
discussion of those three movies has got
to be absolutely insane and it's
incredibly time intensive so we're
working on we're working on ways to
update production but is him probably
just not gonna happen
good yeah that would be a great job for
an intern you're right you're right
let's see here an AMA says have you ever
had a dream that you you have your you
you could you'll do you you wants you
you could do so you you'll do you could
you want them to do you so much you
could do anything letter ten gaming
editing is the thing that Mike and J
like most so me offering to pitch in for
editing festival or SEPA sewed would be
a hard sell that's the part they really
like right but not just that that's the
part they enjoy the most
like I think either of them would rather
sit out an episode then the not edit
it's our signature it's really not
something we can hand off
oh yeah knowin and I have a very
different style than Mike and Jeff right
yeah Anonymous is what does it take to
be an RL em guest you have to be invited
by microjet
I have some good reason to have you on
right and something our LM said said how
much would it cost for a jack learns
touch-typing stream starting with Mario
teaches typing and typing of the Dead as
your final exam can then be terribly
boring for everyone involved
no I realize now I'm just too old I've
missed the boat I've missed the boat for
learning touch typing no matter how much
I would want to do and really I don't
take them that much every day if I typed
moreover dad problems I would probably
make it happen but
so what does rlm do outside the YouTube
channel TV commercials I've produced
some TV commercials rlm they do this
this is what the doom that's it you see
it you seen it you seem to do two videos
that's what they do
I've produced I produce all sorts of
shit as my day job I produce branded
content I make TV commercials
I make corporate videos I produce all
sorts of shit
some of it is fun and interesting and
some of it is not yep if you're just
joining the stream yeah scam is not this
hard I've beaten the game and I am now
playing on target court boat and in
hardcore mode it's a one shot one kill
yeah just for somebody who just tuning
in thinking yeah what's the oldest game
that Richard jack has ever played yeah
it's a weird question yeah at my grandma
had Paul and chip Punk 4 which was pong
four different ways not not just pong
you know pong is the two that is the two
sticks she also had a reverse pong which
had two lines with a break in it and you
had to get the ball in the place you
remember when it came out specific
Oh for me probably not feel like like
Super Mario Brothers Super Mario is
first game you can remember coming off
brand new I have a terrible memory but
no no that's fine yeah for me would
probably Super Nintendo days yeah okay
yeah for me it's probably super
Nintendos day that's when I was old
enough to to actually remember stuff
no that's gonna happen what's the
weirdest thing I've ever produced that I
can talk about yes there are some things
that I've that I have been a part of the
production who I can't that I can't name
specifically yes all right like if I did
I would have to name them in positive
lighting and some of them aren't right
I've done a lot of weird stuff thing I
did really recently that was a lot of
fun was a corporate gig yet it was for a
it was for like a school fundraiser so I
say a corporate gig but you know for a
school fundraiser and they had me
produce kind of a James Bond type short
yeah but you know it's it's a very
typical corporate gig where you know
like oh oh Jeff from accounting always
does this sandwich thing when it gets a
sandwich oh we need to get sandwich
vinegar oh and Mary Sue who has been the
receptionist of the school for the past
50 years is retiring and so she's gonna
be the big surprise again I'm Mary Sue's
you know it's dumb stuff like that is
trying to fit in all of like the in
jokes that they want in
but it was a lot of fun because it was
it was a narrative thing and I very
rarely get to produce narrative videos
anymore you know most of its pre right
now is a Oh a prereq or or montages and
so I very rarely get to produce
narrative videos and it was a narrative
and those are always fun those are fun
to shoot they're all saying it's fine
even just touching it
oh I'm sorry that I I'm sorry that in my
example I named a fictional person Mary
Sue get over it get over it if you can't
if you can't deal with that that's your
fault it's not mine for the same name if
you want to see the history of our LM
isn't there something that's where it is
isn't there a history of it somewhere
Unger into repeater is that yes oh
that's probably not available the disk
isn't they are out of Christmas right if
it's still available digitally look at
look for the rlm collection volume 1
which on it has a history of blanket and
if you want a fun backstory for Mike
rich and Jay the full-length documentary
how not to make a movie that comes with
guerrilla interrupted is a fantastic
documentary and it's all about the early
days
Mike Genrich hanging out and making a
very terrible movie and some mistakes
they they made as some lessons they
learn someone asked if there was a
history of rlm you know what on the
other hand it also is horrible Schilling
because that's what pays the rent
motherfucker you know what happens when
you stop shilling you stop eating deal
with it
five more chances fuckin bullshit
