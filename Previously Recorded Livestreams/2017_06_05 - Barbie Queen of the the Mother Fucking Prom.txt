didn't recognize Barbie board game as
the thing hey chat chat the thing it's
real if you refresh the page chat does
it say we're playing Barbie board game
tabletop is an option if it just changes
a table table if we have to that seems
like a reasonable choice not terribly

this year left with Bob I'm like with
Bob all right Bob or you can be a jerk
and take one of our possibly thing he's
got going on okay so what are the rules
all right so we start at home I think
we're all there this is hung yellows
okay who wants to be Yoda I think that's
you retirements me I'm Yoda I'm going to
be the crack two white one do you want
this attached no I'd like it on the
crack one adorable you me Yoda I'll
switch if you really want no no all
right so we start at home and you roll
it's just look at this classic dice oh
my God look at this diet is the matter
what it is made out of wood and each
number is painted on oh we all should we
ever any Medeiros I wouldn't want to
like ruin day well uh well here's the
thing this is actually a d4 really well
it's a d6 but only four letters ah
numbers 1 1 2 2 3 4 1 1 2 2 3 4 is how
this dice works give you fill okay your
vintage right okay I love alright so
somebody who wants to go first
oh all right I've never been this giddy
so we each start with $25 okay we're all
up this is an eighties game we're out
the home space okay so I'm going
now you roll the die move your piece
that is a two and so the arrows Oh
surprise surprise card let's see what it
says here you volunteer to coach in
spelling and obviously not me one of the
students you help is Bob he asks you for
a date if no other player has Bob you
may accept and go to date time all right
so let's see what state I think you know
what I'm gonna date with Bob seems like
okay so here's you know here's on a date
here is a chance to there's a thing that
here says on a date yeah let's see here
Oh date time see up here says day so yes
and I go date time so then now do I do
it I'll go into here you go into on a
date yeah but you I mean I think you
probably have to run you next on my next
day okay
okay I'm with you it says to go to date
time it doesn't say to take Bob's card
or anything right just to go there okay
I assume now I have to go like through
the date and win the day to get Bob
bobbing for Bob oh it does say that
whenever the instructions say you may do
something you have the choice of not
doing so if you choose what's the
ultimate goal um you need to collect you
need to buy a dress get a steady
boyfriend be elected club president in
any order so we go on to the prom and
get to okay so even if you get to the
prom square if you don't have one of the
other things you have to go back sure
until you get sure you know and I guess
you know like Bob not not not my top
choice but you know I got to win the
game here
so I'm gonna take that okay so I went
you are you yeah I'm still kind of
figuring out the rules figuring out the
rules salad for soda fountain pay $1 if
without boyfriend because there's no boy
to pay for you of course I'm going next
oh no you also have to pay the see me
four bucks I want this dress I know
that's like that smart look at that
dress that's really is a bow and that
would work now right that's back in
style
yeah the art the art is gorgeous I agree
this is this is amazing art we got to
you're on surprise surprise
your dad has received an extra-large
stock dividend he gives you a present of
$10 damn girl
give me that give me that stock dividend
ten bucks I can I have the die piece
thank you one okay so now I'm on date
time okay so if I go on he says you are
not ready when he calls miss one turn
but I was getting beautiful for him no
Jack doesn't have any daughters but you
know maybe someday he'll have a
granddaughter maybe and he can play
Barbie with her maybe Barbary Barbie I
am you know
fries or you go and do not be able to
afford a dress it's your I think it's
your choice not be able to afford a
dress at the other choice well you do
have I Oh use this name is credit nice I
think I'll go with the surprise anyway
though player on my left has arranged a
double date I may accept the boyfriend
you choose for me you want Tom I think
you should have but we only know what
town looks like no and I have two boys I
have two sons and I'm really lucky I
don't have a daughter
girl she would be spoiled a shit like
any anything like I have nieces and I
just give them whatever they want
whenever I'm watching them and by the
way when you get a boyfriend like like
at the end of reals real sign or real
the real Jean interest except it'll be
like and all the pretty things you want
all the pretty big any outside space so
that's any all any here would have been
the same thing I gotta go to school
anyway now it's just gonna just no it's
fine I'm just going to school now you
know what I'm putting my career above
Ben it's not the way to become prom
queen but okay
someone's doing the inflation that $10
in 1961 is worth about eighty one
dollars now well that's a decent chunk
of change for high school girls right
with the dresses and stuff right yeah so
that one dollar at the soda fountain
without a boyfriend comes out to about
eight bucks all right come on guys mama
needs a new boyfriend player on your
left remind you of a $2.00 bet that's
you have to pay her which in this case
means me but really could you please
refer to me as sir give me a five okay
no no my start gets skipped oh right
because you lost a turn I was making
myself you're naturally pretty you don't
but I don't feel like I am this is the
next term I'm sorry all right I'm gonna
go for i skipped class go back one space
right so it's generally funnier than
monopoly monopoly is about slowly going
broke and by the way like lost your
textbook pay three dollars like the
board is a lot to take in but once you
once you follow all the arrows it makes
a lot of sense
textbook inflation is insane though she
was like a calendar textbook would be
like $300 oh right
my new boyfriend you don't have a
boyfriend so pay up 1 $1 for a Saudi
please
it looks today you Inc
alright now I can sign for your hot date
Who am I got a date with again Bob Bob
fucking Bob the guy I'm settling for
Jack my third date third date
wait are you saying wait till Thursday
you said never mind I just what body
parts Bob got to touch if it was the
third day oh I think rich is saying I
should go all the way you've said
fucking Bob oh sure I did yeah I did a
thing and nobody caught it it means it
was a bad thing yeah this is it's just
more awkward now because we're not near
insulating rose but I kind of like that
you're just over explaining it so I
think it's like the Advocate of
inflation and like 1961 it was probably
like the ninth okay so Bob is a total
dickhead Bob criticizes my hairdo
go to the beauty salon oh that son of a
bitch look if you need me to get captain
cat or Poindexter to beat him up we can
we can talk about that right beauty shop
now do I have to do what it says oh do
something about that you're gonna hate
hairy luck people are gonna get a new
hairstyle jack so I'm listening to Bob
that's like twenty four dollars in
today's dollars I just did my hair
before I came here good fresh McCoy yep
class party your boyfriend asked you to
go she has a boyfriend yet they were
they were hanging out but he came I came
highly recommended
because remember we went on a double
date he's putting that on lockdown yeah
yeah I was like this is this is good
good for the prom yeah
101 shower skip one time you people
messing around on dates you're getting
your education I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
the first President of the United States
that's what I'm gonna be congratulation
take awhile you know waiting somewhere
around 2016 it's gonna happen
okay Kerry was in the middle of a very
funny rant it's all right what happened
you have been chosen for the
entertainment committee you may go at
once to a beach party where's my beach
party Oh beach party can somebody put me
over the if you have no boyfriend yeah
if you have no boyfriend go to
introductions and enter what does that
mean what does the rule say Oh mind when
you land on a boyfriend space you may
have that boyfriends card if it is not
taken no player may have more than one
keep the card facedown until new timing
until you land on a space that says go
steady this makes you steady boyfriend
venture in that card phase okay so you
just wait there and hope you do yep yep
you cannot Tom Tom is a one-woman guy
good on you Tom bitch party would suck
well it depends you know like maybe
you're into that huh
who to where am I you're like my tea
you're I'm surprised again surprised
okay
you are on the refreshment committee you
may go
- you may go at once to class party
vodka class party was what I'm gonna do
steady if you had a boyfriend you could
go study but when do you lose the card
lose the date didn't go on well I never
got a card I was just on a date it just
took him to this oh so like I think one
of these says you go to the football
game he has tickets oh this is just Dave
what does this even do he so he doesn't
automatically get one just for going to
the on of dates no no no cuz the card
said go on a date with Bob yeah oh you
know what I shouldn't have even gone in
there because it said you may roll again
and enter if you have a boyfriend I
didn't have a boyfriend so I should be
playing the game wrong I played it wrong
that's fine we're gonna we're just gonna
keep rolling with it because we're
learning and we're playing I so
basically I went on it I made up a
boyfriend he's from Canada you wouldn't
know him his name is poutine yes and
we're madly in love French I was a snack
bar and had to pay a dollar and we skip
my turn so you go wait but didn't Tom
pay for you no no oh I guess that's you
can't leave the house without a man okay
I got one
hey did you got Poindexter well I got
Poindexter okay but you're not you're
not going steady yet right so these
Poindexter's facedown so net now you
need to hit on a space that says now you
need to land on a space that says going
steady and then you can go steady with
Poindexter all right here we go one
surprise I'm the white one surprise you
are voted the most popular girl in your
class if you need one you may choose any
boyfriend who is not taken or you may
exchange your president or you may
exchange your present boy
friend what that's awesome wait finish
it change your steady boyfriend unless
he is your steady date for any boyfriend
not yet taken so if I was going steady I
couldn't exchange wasting my time here
in school this game this game gives me
the impression that I'm wasting my time
so I am gonna take Ken and he's gonna be
my boyfriend so I put Ken face down cuz
we're not going steady yet no I want to
know I thought I was settling for Bob
because the surprise card said the Bob
best her/him yeah but now I got that was
just a date they weren't boyfriend and
now Ken if I can land on a go steady
space I got me a steady boyfriend in his
in friends anyway yeah what is it my
turn
okay I already have a boyfriend so I
could roll again if I didn't but I've
already got Tom and we're steady rock
solid couples say to clean wet board
skip one turn you are just basically I
think all of these are not good oh yeah
ladies to win the chance to earn a
Squatch like what do you get from the
school huh
I need a dollar from everybody
I thought you win by doing the school
thing right is there one good thing in
that school yeah like in this one there
definitely is you can earn money if you
if you take a chance alone on a date I
don't think if you if you land on a
space that has two arrows you can choose
which one to go on so is the banker take
care of money I show cars I use
reminders follow instructions printed on
the space which is how it happened in my
spot I get a dollar from everybody
whenever they get around to paying me up
right yeah every time you pass well you
get a buck already cheering extract I
took one from each of us everything we
pass for land on home you get a five
dollar allowance unless it says return
to home right so if you go around the
board go to any outside space refers to
any space along the edge of the game
board you may pass home but only once
before completing a turn if you run out
of money borrow $10 the first player to
win this game by having a pom prom dress
and being like president of some kind of
committee and having a steady boyfriend
yeah so it says you know to prom is
enter only if you are club president
have a formal dress and a steady dates
so there's no benefit to going to school
this is before Barbie had jobs remember
to the board you lose your textbook
gonna have to pay for it
skip term for lives bed mat this hard
who designed this game I want I want to
documentary about this is this is
fantastic this is beautiful so yeah so
so you know you got to get a date dress
you need money for and then you got to
go shopping school clubs is that where
you can become presidents yes Abbey's
domestic sciences yes so Karen you just
went right you got the three dollars
from everybody I did I took one from
each of us stole great can I have the
die please collections agent okay no
that's very so you take a percentage
free can you move the white piece three
roll again and enter if you do not have
a boyfriend I have a boyfriend
okay I'm good I'm good I'm good
a man does that Oh clearly a man
designed this game I want to know
specifically who I find and return a
lost wallet and get a five dollar reward
hots that's 40 bucks I know
well so is our allowance maybe we only
get it once a month because I mean it's
a pretty long board finally I can stop
wasting my time just get out of school
surprise go back for pieces yes this is
your complimentary ticket to the
football game for making a poster you
may use it later works change it now for
one dollar cash you're using that art
degree of yours rich you mean so you
know what I wouldn't want to attend the
football game because I'm
well wait but what if there's boys at
the football game all the tight ends if
your date has tickets enter free and go
steady so you should hold on to that
okay so that oh yeah you get a boyfriend
you can use it to go so oh my god the
strategy the mad strats if you wish to
try for club office roll again and
that's one that you do need to do
because you need to be president of
something oh right no this is cheaper
easier than the primary electoral
college so let's see what we got here
three one two three and what does that
say so much so you are elected
scholarship club president can we show
the camera again just neat heart work
scholarship club boom you're the
president okay oil lamp it's a slightly
misogynistic concept for the game but
the artwork is beautiful now we can look
at your turn oh yeah
- I'm whitey beauty shop beauty Oh do
something about that day pay $3 you just
can't get your hair good I have the bank
on my way do you want me to take it back
I don't know okay um just curious what
is the recommended age level for this
game is this - high school girls are pre
pre high school girls like I would
imagine it's pre but let's say did
it just says a fun game with real-life
appeal for all girls they probably
didn't label stuff like that back then
I have one X chromosome
and you can probably have half as much
fun with it you have more more fun
depending on how many eggs your sense of
humors on point I don't think your club
president card needs to be upside down
does it wave that wave that's just a
boyfriend boyfriend it's just the
boyfriend that needs to be upside down
right you can be a president but you
have to earn the man was it your turn or
mine oh no I just wanted you just want
okay to redo my hair again oh right
stop to chat with a girlfriend miss one
turn wait did you move Jax oh you're the
barbershop
we got to get our hair just right if we
want they if we want those boyfriend how
many three books great I don't have a
boyfriend I asked me to go study I
wasted my time in class
you had the match dress no I'm the drama
club president you can only be president
in one club though okay so I mean you
could change it if you I think I think
you can change it if you'd rather the
banker will give you a club president
card if you are the first to claim it
when you land on a club president space
no player may have more than one club
president card I think you can it if you
want if you've House Rules at least if
you would rather be drama club you can
I'll take the scholarship club because I
think that that might appeal to
Poindexter he's my true love oh I really
rather have Poindexter a trail you've
already got Poindexter though that's
true
can you move yt1 the headless white yeah
one well I got my hair did so many times
stop to chat with girlfriend miss one
turn you know women women be talking am
i right these are like their hairstyles
and your little your little character
has doesn't have any hair it shaved I'm
at the football game my date doesn't
seem to have a ticket so here's my one
dollar admission you're paying for how
progressive why do we even why do you
even have to go what's the point of
going I don't know I landed on the space
yeah does not go to the game well so
like fermentation gonna solve it because
my boyfriend is face down if I go to Pio
Pio steady sure but since I'm already
steady with Tom I'm so depressed because
I don't have a boyfriend I'm at the
snack bar I'm just just I just have to

dress okay you you're dangerously close
to knocking over the camera I'm sorry
just a heads up what am i pop over here
because it goes do you have enough to
afford the black dress you can do an IOU
though an IOU gets you $10 if you run
you could go here you could go here go
through the money earning chance area
and then go write an address what sounds
like oh good okay so here's the thing if
you run out of money you can borrow $10
from the bank and get an IOU reminder
return this to the bank when you have
the money you may then borrow again if
necessary but no player may and
the path to prom while still holding an
IOU and then you can start earning money

money over here though I've got a total
of $5 in this area I'm not I'm not sure

wind conditions is you need to make it

of the prom and in order to do that you
need a steady boyfriend to be club
president and buy one of these dresses
notice this space here school is
completely useless this space gets you
money this is a makes you go on a date
this is how you become school - I'd be
patient you agreed to go steady oh oh

fairy godmother will turn it into a
pretty dress this this scrap of paper
okay hold on some people have been
looking up Barbie board games on eBay
for me I'm just going to check the
prices from what I've heard before when
wouldn't when it turns into midnight
your tampon turns into a pogo stick and
your diaphragm becomes a trampoline so
you might not want to go with a fairy
godmother
what was this she was saying something
like why was Cinderella afraid of
midnight and it whistles or something
some joke I'm ready years ago and it
said that that her her tampon turned
back into a trampoline and her diaphragm
into a into a trampled era
herb herb excuse me your tampon into a
pogo stick and her diaphragm into a
trampoline all the visuals okay so you
know by the way 18 bucks yeah but these
are your people who are gonna bid it up
well you know what this one doesn't have
the cool cards this is not a complete Oh
Barbie said I don't think we'll see
we'll see anyway thank ya this this is

$1.00 if you are a club member I am a
club member
well it's good to be a club member this
is a wonderful board game and and it's
ridiculous it's the most ridiculous
thing I've played in a long time I did
play they made an alien board game like
out of the original movie alien they
made a board game where you could like
move a xenomorph and a survivor that was
pretty ridiculous I did not base my life
choices or my educational choices on
this game boys were less enlightened
times anyway well I'm in like desperate
need of a boyfriend here right so I
guess I have to go here well again you
also need a club I don't know let's not

because it like it tell it like it dings
and it tells you where the sales are I
entered a $10,000 Limerick contest and
won five dollars so you didn't do that
good ain't still five dollars it's
better than nothing just being left out
of there does that say Jack's wife does
say enter Oh
so that's like a dead zone it doesn't
say you may
one two three yes now you're gonna try
again with that boyfriend - how about
that wonderful movie it's really good
one Wonder Woman No very I heard it was
good it's very good
wait does that mean you get to go out
with Ken no because Ken's going steady
with job that's right oh I didn't want
to break you guys up for anything can't
yeah well there's a card that you four
could break us up but there is yeah
oh you skip class go back one space or
so either way Enter
Limor contests get $5 your Limerick was
just as lousy as mine there once was a
lady who went to school and all she did
was drool and all she did was drool
she bought many books and found all of
her learn how to cook so she loved
having cooks and now she feels quite the
fool I earned $5 making artificial
flowers once was a pupil named Jan - who
kept all those bills in a stack got my
fat cash here exchange any of that maybe
what's going on with school let's get
out of school as quick as possible let's
get a 4-1 you'll have a headache return
home I want them out of school I guess
she's got five bucks for going home to a
ho doo doo doo doo yeah going up going
home is a good thing
close enough you know like it was a off
the top of my head Limerick like that's
the best like it was a five dollar
Limerick to once was a person named Jack
his rhymes I washed dinner dishes and
get a dollar rich already took the cheap
dress yes I did I want that one well I
mean right everyone wants that one but
I'm doing I'm just someone asked me when
I woke up what I would be doing at 10:00
p.m. so $8.00 yeah there's your IOU you
cannot go to prom if you have an hour
you but you can pay back but considering
he still needs a vice-presidency and
boyfriend he has a question for that
rich controller they need to choose one
of two games to buy Dragon's Dogma or
Friday the 13th roll again if you wish
you have more time in both I don't wish
to enter that that's not an easy
question there's not an easy question
it's not an easy question at all the
question is is are you looking for a
solid single player experience or are
you looking for a multiplayer experience
Dragon's Dogma is a really great single
player experience and it's Friday the
13th is a good multiplayer track - he's
got a really fun world it does and great
monster fights hey what's that have to
do with the promise extent your weight I
would grade it - you could have a 10
I'll tell you what I'll tell you what
are we gonna drag ins Dogma okay thank
you
um can buy the dresses Friday the 13th
that's the full price you will probably
find that you'll probably find a sale on
that and the relatively near future okay
saying good go Dragon's Dogma no no okay
that's fair
when is the Steam sale well they just
got done with their summer stay on was
this uh player on my left reminded me of
a two dollar debt that I use that's
right Fred for the for the privilege of
attending my birthday party can I just
do that with a buck anyway yeah but you
can use them I'm reading that you can
use it to go to that space Oh anytime
meeting too late I don't know alright
hey you know what I'm gonna let you
that's that's strategic yep that's full
of strangers bucks or you go or you go
or you but she could have done that
before she's a job rich to be 300 and
Dragon's Dogma is $12 on GOG so ya go
Dragon's Dogma it's gonna be fine
there's your answer $12 for Dragon's
Dogma great world an amazing boss too
though oh yeah it's only 12 yeah I guess
the thing dragons are what's the worst
board game we've ever played
that's the Morse board game you've ever
played for you know what for me it was a
it was that pandemic it's that that yeah
really different like we I just had such
a bad time playing I'm sure it's a fine
game but when I played it I had a really
bad time there's an adult I doubt I
would get much out of chutes and ladders
snakes and ladders it's a good game no
all right I made dad play Candyland with
mom to play it with me for like two
weeks
begging and finally I bribed him with a
neck
he's like I guess I can't say no now
dislike five minutes I have an answer
okay
mousetrap it it's a fine contraption I
don't understand why there's even a
board game built around it no yeah oh
right the only thing that mattered was
building all the stuff and watching it
you're yellow yes I don't need to pay at
the soda phone what-what-what clubs are
taken club that's the only one available
oh oh oh one two three Oh sources make a
comeback comeback time babe no what did
you say well that's it well there you go
sport
yeah we just don't like it face down a
very long time and you know Chet I'm
sure pandemic is a good board game it's
it's a collaborative board game and we
just happen to be playing with someone
who was so into the strategy that
basically he made the decisions for
everyone and they were all the correct
decisions so you don't want to not do
them but then basically we weren't
playing we were just listening to
someone so I had a bad experience I'm
sure pandemic is a fine game I'm sorry
if pandemic is your favorite game ever
we're good sorry I was checking tips too
don't wait the dragon was kind of a dumb
game I don't know if you caught it as
you have a boyfriend Ken's got me it's a
very popular square is a soda fountain
and bedbugs was kind of a dumb game once
once the picking up the plastic things
with tweezers thing got away we're just
in about 2000 you're considering well
what are the odds that I'm gonna land on
that space you and I could just get the
dress out of the way you couldn't send
my head for the prom you could sit right
here did you wait what Oh
go ahead go to any square but then
there's no guarantee you'll get the two
you need to land right on that one right
you might overshoot it I think I'm going
to let us do this and instead oh that
gives you a little wiggle room
Poindexter has written a poem about me
which is printed in the newspaper you're
not steady yet he has received $10 for
it and insists on giving me half that
better be for me he's gonna use it to
buy use yes five bucks for having
Karen's boyfriend carry you gotta stop
keeping him face down Katie let's
Poindexter look at her scholarships are
useless because it's just about
education and clearly that doesn't
matter one prize or worse Oh God but so
complain this is so you'd have to get
another one yeah next turn you over the
dress or not you have to roll the one in
the next term or you're not a surprise
guard Oh or or the surprise cutter card
it's your choice you get one of the
squares um I'm gonna go ahead and try to
roll the one that's the next turn okay
okay all right
oh that's dangerous living dangerous but
I mean I think that's I think that's the
safe bet I bet you the surprise was good
the dress of your choice
Oh Oh
do you have $50 to get yourself solo in
the spotlight yeah she's gonna snipe you
35 that's my dress seven 38 39 41 so I'd
have to take an IOU but I'd get a
guaranteed dress now but it's not the
dress I want but you're also going for
the blue dress so one of the spotlight
is in my mind the second best or or I
can go here maybe you could trade
dresses later at least you'd have one in
the bag I mean what are the odds that
Karen's gonna roll a one realistically
you could you could go hearings and then
rolling that doesn't have a roll again
but that gives me an extra ten bucks
yeah that does so that would also mean I
could go back to the black dress and not
have an IOU or you could get an IOU and
get that one if you're all along exactly
yeah penis oh you so one two Fashion
Show I earn ten bucks Jack you're a kind
of a tit why you're kind no I want that
blue dress taking the dress she's going
for he's going for the dress I'm going I
need to roll for and get there before
you that's basically what needs to
happen what - okay we're neck-and-neck
but I get another 10 bucks we're neck
and neck but it's not the dress I want
exactly my name is Dana I want a pretty
blue dress I mean that's that's too
classy for me I wanted to be more
summery let it Club plans and outing
remember you pay a buck one you know
somebody would wear and run oh right and
how are you gonna move and dance in that
thing you know what about
evening I mean it's really Poindexter
it's not like Poindexter can dance
oh yeah this is something that you would
wear to like tea with the Queen that's
way too much you know you know I do I'm
like a dollar short thanks to you that
was a genuine squeal from Karen okay so
now here it is if I get it to I get my
pretty blue dress if I roll over I'm
screwed if I get a one you might get
taken from me
we need that too we need that too we
need then to bitch if I get up and go up
here you guys promise not to do anything
nasty to my money do anything here we
wanted money
I'm just something nasty to your
boyfriend not a terribly faithful
boyfriend right I mean he already wrote
a poem about me go through this way I'm
so out of your way okay there we go
everything's fixed everything's fine
okay action zine or I'm either caught in
the rain I either get to go home and get
another five bucks or one two three four
or go to date time which doesn't do me
any good damn it
well date-time would bring you further
back so that you could write well
daytime would end at a surprise possibly
but I'm just gonna go home we get that
five bucks and try to make my way around
again
god dammit thank you
rabble rabble rabble rabble all right
now I need a two for dressed is still
available all ooh yeah all right I'm
gonna it's a race and race for the dress
it's a race for that blue dress that's
the pretty blue dress oh you have a
boyfriend right now we wait now we wait
for Karen that's that
how we how we feel about the Barbie game
I'm loving it right I kind of like it
it's simple but it's it's by the way
it's giving us a ton of laughs oh yeah
old-school sexism and you know I love
games that like just tell you what to do
whenever you land up I'm still just in
shock that we're playing this why why
you got to go where the night takes you
yeah yeah I'm glad that I had it in my
truck and then it randomly came up in
conversation this is this is how it
works you know like no offense to Orion
Trail or organ trail but this was
clearly the better option I think so I'm
not going on eBay right now to look up
those listings barbie game complete
Oh notice we are playing the Barbie game
queen of the prom that's great we caught
up on tips we are caught up on tips
that's great that's great no one else
has seen Wonder Woman yet so we can't
really chat a million woman I watched I
watched the half in the bag on it just
to see Mike and Jays take yeah yeah
they're like everyone's basically saying
the same thing which like it's good well
it's got some problems but it overall
it's really good which is true like I I
disagree with them a little bit on the
on the third acts it's it's weak it's
the weakest part of the movie but I
don't know what happens in the third act
well isn't anything like a disgusting
fight scene hey there's a big CG fight
scene yeah and so like it's kind of out
of place but it's a very good movie I
was reading today I was talking a little
bit about like the great action scene it
a Wonder Woman has one of the greatest
action scenes I've seen in any modern DC
and apparently some executives at Warner
Brothers wanted to remove this amazing
action scene that was right in the
middle of Wonder Woman that everyone
agrees is the best part of and some dumb
executives trying to remove it and
luckily patty Jenkins said hey this is
important what the fight scene yeah the
greatest action sequence in the movie in
any DC movie that I've seen recently
it's and and apparently she had to fight
to keep it in which just makes it extra
it's my turn some have said that
Schneider might have an outside space
what do you mean you need to go spend
either going to eat oh you go to the
football game yes yes yeah we'd have to
pay a dollar but you know all right I'll
pay a dollar and I'll go to the football
game and then we're gonna make it
official make it official oh is it what
that two-timer
Karen you're too good for him you know
he doesn't deserve you
you know the poll
he wrote about me I didn't say it was a
good poem nice nothing about what a jerk
I yeah that's true that's true
you're smelly and ugly and mean you look
like a dork in your jeans then you gave
her five dollars money he got for it to
try to butter her up because she was so
mad so player to my left yes under your
chair

gives me a ride I pass home once and
collect allowances car breaks down again
at school entrance in collect alone yeah
I'm assuming you have to go to school
yeah I think so
I'll school is a punishment and I love
it
but I'm like I guess also thematically
it makes sense what's like you know kids
don't generally like school like oh
bomber I gotta go to school so your
allowance has been increased $1 for the
rest of the game six blocks damn dawg
that's a heck of a surprise alrighty

it a serious expression that's it I it's
weird
what up collared shirts it's growing up
means it would be beneath my dignity to
climb a tree to do you were out late no
I need the money well in a couple of
times you can go in - chance - no but I
gotta get around I gotta go to prom
before Jack does rich is using a tiny
yoda for his piece we only had three
pieces so there are a couple of riches
you
there yeah yeah Jack it's your turn
there are no age recommendations on the
box for this game according I saw
someone earlier according to
BoardGameGeek they say six and up it
says a fun game with real-life appeal
for all girls even girls at heart and
many boys 3 - beach party
if you have no boyfriend go to
introductions but I do have a boyfriend
me and Ken at the beach getting a tan
before the prompts yeah
hey there Ken let's go and dance a
neighbor gives me a lift to any outside
space yeah you're surprised I am offered
$10 from my old bike which is too small
for me collect so so when is prom prom
like I'm this white piece here if I can
make it to this space I think going to
prom
yeah but then like all of these are bad
I think or except for this one like this
this is a skip one turn this is a roll
again oh so you don't have to go to
school if oh a feeling on this one you
have to go to dad's car oh yeah know the
neighbor boy loves to give us rides oh
yeah I'm not saying how we're paying for
these ride was the sixties roll again to
enter chance to earn which you need
money
I do especially because you didn't get
allowance cuz you were out late
something bad could happen to Jay watch
stopped
oh yeah no there's a lot of more things
I can happen you entered a ten thousand
dollar Limerick contest and won
five bucks five bucks in I entered a
$10,000 contest and I won five bucks
yeah what is with that it wasn't a very
good Limerick join the club only got
five bucks - but you know what we we
tried and I think that's all that really
you're out of luck your limericks suck
all right here we go here we go one two
three four one of the spaces in between
say what are the possibilities okay you
need a gift for Mother's birthday go to
the sweet shop we don't want that dad's

me way over there and prom so like but
