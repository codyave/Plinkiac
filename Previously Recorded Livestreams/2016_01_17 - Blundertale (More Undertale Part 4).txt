we're already friends aren't we oh god I
hope I sighed yeah did I did I even
you've been reading my post this with
the whole time
well well I hope you were briefly about
noob YouTube because it's just it's
terrible it's a travesty
okay alright
looks like we're going up
that only takes me back you have to
there's a puzzle on top theorem and the
puzzle in the bottom of the room and you
need to clear both of those puzzles
before you can go to the right of the
room is what he said so choose your
destination
oh okay oh and you only have one shot
well how does this work I didn't do this
oh you so you have to clear you just
have to have a clear space from the
yellow arrow to the white arrow okay but
all of these black boxes move whenever
you press any direction I was kind of
neat
yeah nice simple focus
no potions on that
yeah you got it fucked up
like this music
I like this be like what that's right
dr. Lyon these are this is a puzzle as
fuck you know puzzle like that puzzle
puzzle quest

I cannot I believe in you because I am
stupid pants this dream has lost around
23 viewers since we started that is
incorrect midget testicles we how when
we started streaming we had about 300
years I have a fun little thing here to
tell that gives me an info graph of how
many people have been on there when we
started trimming we had 312 viewers and
that has steadily risen for the most
most part of the stream we had about 539
and now we've capped off at 600 so it's
not our highest was 613 so we may have
lost 13 viewers but we're still we're
still doing pretty good still doing
pretty good I have no idea what I'm
doing but
oh yes thank you time to research that's
who Paul Scheer is he was also on human
giant of really great really grow you
know the solution no but I can figure
out yeah
nitrous oxide I figured out the last one
so
I think the key is that flip up top what
oh I thought we needed to make a line up
and down there I misunderstood oh sorry
yeah you were firing the thing from the
yellow arrow to the white arrow and so
he's made it clear oh I thought we
needed to make a path from the arrow to
the arrow well yeah no I mean like line
it up in that section like like a tube
oh sorry then I then I did a very poor
job of explaining it to you and I'm very
sorry it's okay

should be it was great that's Christmas
hey yeah the smell of cobwebs fills the
air you're filled with determination
right
I'm glad Jules that you had a good time
watching me realize what counts
sometimes you just need that one thing
that one thing what was there was I was
having trouble remembering one of the
the actors in space cop she came yeah
she gave that's an unusual name and I
could not remember cheek' and I worked
with him on a couple days and I felt
really bad about not remembering his
name he's been in real things he's been
in he's a real actor and he's great and
space cop and I felt really bad and so I
was and rich just came up with a nice
simple little pneumonic device cheek'
and you remember chica because you know
what cheek a likes cheek a likes chips
she had this thing he was eating the
chips GK likes the chips and for summer
and I still remember this to this day is
just like GK likes chips you gotta you
gotta associated associate things as
like columns like the Coliseum like the
columns in the Coliseum it's like oh
that's the one thing I need now
GK likes chips columns like the Coliseum
there's this nice guy he got me a latte
once Lance got me a latte
I remember that states and capitals yeah
back in school I remember Hartford
Connecticut because Hartford heart
surgery connect the cut you make from
the heart surgery there you go Hartford
Connecticut I've never never forgot that
I forgot every other state in capital
but not that one
that's a weird one did you hear what
they said they said a human wearing a
striped shirt will come through yeah
yeah see yeah I heard they hate spiders
yeah I heard they love to stop on them I
heard they liked to care their legs off
I think these are all different spiders
saying these things they all sound the
same okay all every spider they're all
related great I'm not coming up with 80
different voices I heard oh it's her
yeah
how do I do just answer they were an
awfully sticky with their stingy with
its wrong they're awfully stingy with
that money there you go you think your
taste is too refined huh pastries don't
you dare disagree with that nation I
think your taste is exactly what the
next batch needs traps you look at that
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
eating her curds and whey a long thing I
know that on the side
what's our strategy here oh sorry money
Oh
okay okay don't look so good
didn't look saved you my dear oh fuck
what what think peple is a better look
on you trip in a strange purple web what
don't give her any more money
or Chappell we should be proud
Oh My Jesus Christ you got this you got
this like fucker face nine Wario says I
don't know here's five dollars thanks
for keeping me entertained we do our
best
thanks man Hilario we try I think you
know you know I think it was fair to
like rich was trying with the paying or
maybe that did something I I don't think
I don't think that's the right call but
struggles muffin is so fused by your
antics that she gives you a discount
oh yeah do I do you were rich reading
game informer no I think I have a
subscription to it because you know you
get the the GameStop power of the card
or whatever so I get it I don't read it
care about Mad Magazine oh nice on it
like that kind of like games writing is
so irrelevant now because any
information it would give you has
already been on the internet a month ago
and I don't find their their stories
that interesting this is different
that's great that's great
I think I like this battle gobbledygook
says are there any reading materials in
the Arlen bathroom or have phones made
them obsolete phones have made them
obsolete yes you just have to make sure
you have a charge before you get it you
know what you know what I have in my
bathroom at home for a tablet there you
go your bathroom tablet it does not
leave the bathroom
well casually what more so more so the
tub
I've taken a hot baths since my back
went bad on me tub yeah I've read I read
the table in the tub I'd be so afraid to
get that thing near water yeah well
there you go that's kind of weird I
don't think I would probably ruin the
tenly I don't think would kill me I
could be wrong no there's fine enough
electrical discharges to kill you it's
just I'd be worried about ruining the
tablet yeah this is I don't have it I
can't afford me tonight it's just a
cheap piece of shit the ipood yeah you
get one of those cheap like Amazon fire
tablets
enough struggling is working yeah
she's reduced the proper and you offered
a lot of thing we have to keep we think
we have to pay yep despite this clap
along to the music
did you check she be yellow check with
oh oh you know Jackie usually gives you
a hint right whoa no that was a
croissant that was like a croissant oh
right it was a croissant or rings Shane
I should do a parlor excuse yourself if
she invites you to her oh if she invites
jewelry it's strange but I saw I saw
them in the shadows changing sheets
croissants
nice nice nice there's odds of Heidi's
up the web around you
oh it's lunchtime isn't it oh my feed my
pet you could eat a spider item to help
you a lot but you have none
yes sir oh so they're saying just
survive hang her slows down your attacks
but it's all just about surviving this
is like with the boss attack oh my god
right elegan and my rights telegin says
whatever new character comes next make
it sound like George Lucas that's what
he's saying I don't care what that tells
I was hoping for Peter Lorre
today actually Peter Lorre my spiders
been trumped in the ruins for
generations
yeah well hot dogs for home I wanted to
save it
nope they're real they go under the dole
snag ins fate code is impossible though
Oh apparently if you either had a spider
donut or the spider cider you could have
ended this fight immediately really yep
it's fine she just pissed at you for not
buying her shit buy my shit
okay here we go here we go here we go
I don't think we've done everything for
the pacifist run I think we might have I
don't know if it counted but I think we
killed that ghost once did we have to
restart you might have kept it simply
killed the ghost so I don't think we're
gonna get the pacifist run well I don't
that counts as a death it's a ghost I
didn't say it died oh yeah
the next voice needs to be Michael Caine
we'll get my cocaine in there
Steven ater PC hue boys managed to order
a copy of space cop before they sold out
me and my mates are looking forward to
watching it but good I'm really PS
Jackie or laugh is underrated you know
it's just a normal well it's no rich
Evans's it's no rich oh Jesus Christ
but I look for I look forward to so many
people seeing space cop huh a telegram
the spiders running the route this the
spiders in the ruins it's brought me a
sense of a Bruins what the saying of
this for you handed you were really
passionate about spiders this is all big
misunderstanding I thought you were
someone that hated spiders the personal
aspects so you must submit a different
human in a striped shirt sorry for all
the trouble to you you can come back
here anytime and for no charge at all
I'll wrap you up and let you play with
my pets again just kidding I'll spare
you now it's over despairing you
fearful self boy says hey Jack me and a
buddy rewatched all three prequels
yesterday to hurt ourselves curious when
you've seen them last the blanket
reviews here's here's how it works
yeah okay yeah yeah pheromones came out
I was excited along with everybody else
of course saw it yeah yeah and then I
saw one more time in the theater because
I had to go with Karen and I wanted to
see if it was really that bad it was
like I was in I was in a state of like
what I you know I was worried about it
because Jedi are inherently boring
characters yeah but then I saw it and it
was just much worse than I thought
you know yeah so there was the to view a
is what I was that theaters I did see it
once on video cuz I was still in a state
of disbelief I've rented it once
no oh my god must been shocked yeah
there's no way it could have been that
bad then attack of the clones at the
theater yeah I really wasn't hyped at
all I wasn't interested
right well it'll be better this time and
I'm like no you are Kara better shit I
was in denial the first no the first was
just all the expenses Matt that at all I
was I was the one saying it can't be
better
we're stuck with these characters these
characters are shit it's unsalvageable
it's already unsalvageable and i want to
see it because you almost have to and i
got in free okay
Mike Mike worked in the theatre of that
and he was you know management liked him
and they got everyone on the theatre I
got to see it like days early mm-hm they
had like a special employee screening
and I got in on that okay I wanted to
leave halfway through the movie I really
honestly I wanted to leave after like
the the forty-fifth talking on a couch
scene I I literally wanted to get up and
leave but I couldn't because I was
invited in for free at an early
screening and it would have been just
like the rudest fucking thing imaginable
it would have been so the last half of
that movie was me just like I want to go
and I couldn't leave
because everywhere I don't like the Sam
yeah episode 3 yeah I did like that
outfit natalie portman where's maybe in
that white jumpsuit yeah I did not go to
see Attack of the Clones the second time
in the theater yeah because I couldn't
stand my first viewing yep yep and I
certainly didn't get it on video or rent
it or anything hmm
and then episode three came out I had no
interest in seeing it at all not even
not even for the curiosity of seeing a
new Star Wars film
and I don't want to go I don't want to
go and Mike and J actually just showed
up at my house like uninvited they just
showed up we're gonna see episode three
I don't want to go oh we're going to see
episode three come on no I don't want to
go they basically dragged me kicking and
screaming to see episode three in the
theater I hated it yeah but God did I
laughs after Darth Vader says the last
the last part of that movie like right
up right up it took before the credits I
was in hysterics I could not stop
laughing I did not see that movie again
in the theater or in video yeah and I
did not the first two were so bad I did
not go to see the third one in the movie
theater and then I did not watch any of
them again until Mike started making the
fellated reviews and I watched some the
movies with Mike gonna take notes and
discuss things that's it so I watched
you know I watched the Phantom Menace
these heck of clones and Revenge the
sith one more time each with him and
they were really long one more times
because the whole time it's like well
let's go back to figure that out what
just happened wait let's rewash that
what what is what is he trying to do
what is puppy right under let's move on
why is he doing this I know let's go did
he say something earlier let's go back
and check yeah
and so like you know I watched it watch
them one more time age but it like took
like four hours four to five hours each
viewing but you know and then I haven't
seen them since I don't have analytical
viewing doesn't even count as a viewing
because you were dissecting yes yes yeah
no and I haven't the first two I haven't
seen since the theater and the third one
I saw what I when it came out on DVD
third one and I those are my only
viewings of them so I mean because I
know they're bad which is worse the
prequel trilogy or Adam Sandler's works
here's here's how it goes the prequel
trilogy jeez ruins something beautiful
Adam Sandler's movies were always ugly
Billy Madison is a great movie whatever
I don't care
Billy Madison I don't care good a full
movie happy Gilmore's all right Billy
Madison is a beautiful beautiful movie
yeah let's give God you know that was
fun people like to hate on the new
things that's why everyone's hating on
force awakens somebody asked me if I
really liked the force awakens yeah I
liked it I don't know that I really
really really loved it really even
really really really like it it's fun
was a good movie best Star Wars movies
destroy the Jedi yeah
the debate is as a whole is it better
than Jedi guys good
Genet parts of Jedi are like great yeah
as a whole I don't think it works
there's a lot of bad things in it
the force awakens maybe doesn't have the
same highs it doesn't have the throne
room scene it doesn't have the glory
that was Jabba's palace but as a whole I
think it's more consistently better than
Jedi was it's you know it's tough
because it's so different totally you
know like it's such a JJ Abrams movie
with the you know like with the with the
wisecracking and the and the you know
what would poke that Poe Dameron you
talk first I thought first who talks
first what's going on like that's not
that's that line right there is not
something that would exist in the
original Troy Star Wars movies that kind
of like quick-witted everybody's having
a great time that's JJ but that fight at
the end of the force awakens done latest
lightsaber fight so so much so much
better than the the soulless emotionless
ballet dances at the Preakness so much
better right to awkwardly swing in there
light swords
not like a dance all right all right
no more Star Wars sorry we got it we got
games oh look it's SpongeBob SquarePants
poster prowl or make them by the tides
of fate hmm and guess who the two
star-crossed lovers are going to be Jack

high castle binge watch it all with my
brother last night anymore show

caps by the way I think this is your 100
human at the expanse if you if you have
the ability to watch the expanse I've
been really enjoying that so good yeah
yeah five six episodes in that's the one
where it's it's the Sapphire original
and the action is not that good and some
of the special effects are a little
cheesy but the story is good enough to
carry you through like I want to know
what happens next
expands the acting not so great

hear a woman's voice who is there
so naturally I respond dishes dishes who

dollars in the come while yelling oh my
God look at this creepy guy Oh
thinking back here I realize they forgot
to make a reservation but they didn't
want to look like a mess table so I kept
walking me me anyway now I'm just kind
of consuming doing off these viscous but
like Vegas no I like Fisk is better
you're right
oh it's Hellboy little wind-up mazes
with puzzles in order to foil humor
attacks what our Billington's winding
and confusing some awful tradition has
old two feet without being up your
armpit comedian I'm very funny people
gonna laugh at my jokes but release they
line up on your jokes at first and then
then they all turn against you it's not
very fun when people do that simple just
people just don't understand what I'm
trying the same with with my jokes I
have a vision I keep changing my
punchline that's because you know that's
the way I originally wanted the
punchline to be that way but some other
comedians have have taken my jokes and
they're bad they're basically white
slavers just taking my jokes and abusing
them some people say they tell them
better but I think I think they're
they're they're they're just as bad as
white slavers no my son he when he wants
to be a comedian like this was thought
huh
that's nice this guy is supposed to be
some kind of like Bronx first yeah
Boston person I guess but was this fun
of an old no it's family so haters gonna
be George's father but it's jokes well
huh well not very funny not like not
like my jokes I told much better jokes
than my son
well nobody laughs but they just don't
get my jokes like I do know I make small
personal jokes in my garage
I sold all my good jokes for four
billion dollars and then they wouldn't
let me tell them anymore I don't know
why they stopped letting me tell my own
jokes and they paid four million dollars
for my jokes
it's weird I figure they're still my
jokes really they just gave me money and
I'm gonna take that money he told them
these awful puns
it's kind of an aversion tomorrow to our
family well it's not very funny
his mother passed on he says his mother
Rob divorced me after sleeping with a
friend of mine and and ruining my my
view of love and marriage and human
emotion well he couldn't stand living at
home she was really talented especially
Joe she had heard all my jokes
some people think she made the butter I
think you've ruined my original vision
not not convinced that she made the bone
I got rich now he helps me with my jokes
he loves all of my jokes yeah Mitch
McCallum Mitch Burke Helena sense I'm a
terrible I'm gonna have to edit that
punch line we good where's my queer CGI
team can we we put some some cartoon
animals into that punch line never make
it my fault
make them make them move around the wop
and Stan how I suppose everything else
in the punch line I'll have you fall
down my behind baby fall down some think
that's a funnier joke and we've ever had
before
yeah get out of here
