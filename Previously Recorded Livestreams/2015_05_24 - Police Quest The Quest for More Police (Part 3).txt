you say sweet balls hippety damn that's
that's not oh do you have the subscribe
everything up uh yeah did you connect
yeah we are connected great that's great
everything is everything is functional
oh my lord everything is functional and
game yeah game there's a game it's true
we're gaming playing that C's that's
taking pictures of things that's my
email photographer that's my email
telling me that uh we are indeed
streaming which is always appreciated so
we're back to police quest and where we
last left off there was a chicken on a
man's desk and we're I'm sure if this is
just the comic relief or if there's
something we have to do with this
chicken uh yeah okay and I'm hearing us
too and hold on I just want to make sure
that we sound okay quick audio test
Wow we're here come on we were working
on audio earlier and it turns out the
recent problems we've been having with
audio computer yeah has come from some
virtual audio cables that we downloaded
to fix the audio problem on my computer
and the second I deleted that because it
was useless and in my way everything
started working the echos all went away
it's really true we uh I came in a
little extra early today like also it's
Sunday and I came in again just because
I was I was gone on Wednesday but we
came in oh I'm hearing us now finally
the commercials over
I'm gonna make sure I'm muted on me oh
yeah that's a web word of my web going
yeah okay we sound great so we
downloaded these virtual audio cables in
order to fix something we tried to fix
something but in the process we created
this echo thing which we've apparently
fixed we've we and we've we finally
switched to mumble which sounds great
mm-hmm we can have our own special
mumble place and everything we are right
now they probably heard you say that
you're about to peace I don't know we
might be having some streaming issues
we're having some straightening issues I
don't know like it takes it's taking a
while for my stream to hog but that's
fine
I I have it opened down oh great so then
everything's fine
I'm not moving around for all I know
it's frozen sure but we downloaded these
virtual audio cables to fix a problem
and it created another problem and then
we did weren't sure where we got the
other problem from but hopefully it's
all fixed now and everything's fine
until the next problem right so yes we
we have mumble now which sounds
significantly better than Skype it
almost sounds like you know like in
Skype it always sounded like someone was
calling in on their phone but mumble
it's almost as if the other person
right there are you paid are you paid no
no I'm not but I'm just saying the audio
quality is noticeable volume is low our
volume is there just somebody on the
chat saying volume is low try turning
your volume up you could also try
turning your volume up that's that's the
thing you could do hold on I have a pair
of earphones right here and I can hear
us oh but I'm having loading issues mine
isn't loading refresh refresh your
screen you're gonna die we have a TV
with the game on it you could see what's
going well I know I want to hear us okay
okay because for anyone who's
complaining about our audio issues no it
sounds it sounds perfect you need to
turn yourself up if you're not you can
hear it now pizza train who is a
subscriber since as volume is that max
just turn it up a bit
mine sounds great but yeah rich if you
want to just turn it up a little bit
nervy yes those are the problems
inevitably start gonna do it I don't
agree with it right I don't agree with
it okay but I just just he did he just
clicked it it's a mouse slightly louder

Dooley's desk Oh what's in our inventory
car keys briefcase a pen a copy of the
newspaper oh there we go handcuffs a

get out all my guys and stuff so we
obviously put the newspaper down on the
desk look at desk keeps his desk neat

joke this could just be haha my comic
relief oh sure

what's a gremlin well this is the word
you've been saying over and over again
come on chief come on chief okay
that's fine my trip my trip was really
great my trip was really great I enjoy
traveling I've done a little too much of
it this month in the past month but I do
enjoy traveling mostly because of the
wonderful food I get to eat I convinced
everyone to go get ramen with me which
is one of my very favorite foods when
you get it at a restaurant ramen nice
the good ramen not like you know 10-cent
ramen noodles yeah there's this really
great ramen place in Silver Lake
California called Silver Lake ramen and
and it's super fantastic ramen and we
all had a great time you know it was
good like I had to convince people to go
get ramen because everyone has this idea
about ramen like it's this it is this
awful thing but I convinced him to get
there and then the entirety of the meal
everyone was in utter silence eating and
that's how you know it's good just just
oh it's you know it's like super it's
one of the best things evian yeah thank
you for subscribing we really appreciate
it
nine months in a row and also dick the
bday boy thank you for subscribing we
really appreciated and made new spoo
thank you for thing you did with
subscription join appreciate yes
much a pre-set a month and i was one
more ok I'll Jam drock's
42 thank you for soups for subscribing
very much appreciate so much like that
we enjoy to be alright okay
okay that's true the Zaius everyone does
love ramen but they don't know it yet
because everyone has this idea that
ramen is a bad food and there's only one
good ramen place in Milwaukee and it's
way up on the north side so when you're
when you're out in a bigger city you get
some ramen okay all right hey Sonny yeah
you're off-duty aren't you some of us
are going by the blue room to throw Jack
a little surprise party after you change
clothes why don't you stop by the Blue
Room yes okay the Blue Room so they're
going to a gay bar is that the gay bar
yeah the dancer we hired for Jack's
party is something else yeah I asked
about chicken a man worried about that
chicken damn it
okay should we ask about that promotion
whose promotion the promotion we talk to
that lady about earlier we're getting a
promotion yeah we left off right before
the chicken I don't remember this was a
week ago rich this is a four Jack what
okay yesterday we filled out the memo we
put the number one the thing then the
Baskin did we yes oh I haven't I don't
even remember that these are all things
that happen I was gonna be in narcotics
oh that's right okay that I do remember
that yes I have I've drunk many beers
since last Sunday unfortunately there
are no beers at the studio today some
inconsiderate people drank all the beers
what's up it was mostly me but and
forgot to refill them okay let's see
here Sonny I am extremely busy right now
how can you do that I guess we'll hear
more about that promotion later I guess
our next objective should be to go to
the Blue Room don't we need only one of
they have we asked everyone about the
chicken I don't think anybody else cares
about the chicken okay for all I know
this is comic relief I don't know what
do you want to wear we're doing we're in
this together what do you wanna do about
this chicken problem do you want to go
back in that guy's office and ask him
about the chicken no that didn't seem to
work did you ask the lady about the
chicken they did not ask lady we're
gonna have a tea but that's the lady
brought the chicken before we leave hey
uh hey lady know nothing about no
chicken make sure I have I have my map
but ready to go how can how can you do
that huh she says how can you do that
then she asked us if we're lost I don't
think she likes us very much that lady
doesn't know it's good for she gonna end
up being deal of interest no probably
not
no like much like
was this was the spa demon thing we saw
where that like asshole cop was the love
interest by default that spa oh yeah
yeah yeah that was not the one with the
default love interest oh no that wasn't
death spa that was ninja 3 ninja 3 the
assassination yeah yeah alright so we
have to change clothes okay change
clothes also yes we you know we won't do
much spoilers but go see Mad Max I saw
it last night finally what do you think
it's great what do you think it's great
I saw it on date night my wife was
unsure that she wanted to see it and all
of a sudden one day I get home and she
had finally watched the trailer for it
and she goes we're going to see that
this weekend she's a she's a big fan she
had never seen any of the previous Mad
Max movies I'm trying to talk Karen into
saying it so I can see it again yeah
yeah oh yeah I mean it's great it's a
it's a great movie I was super excited
to see it it's so we're naked by the way
yeah it was so refreshing to see a movie
not try to do their whole realistic
stick that's what I kept expecting I
expected them to Nolan fuck it up where
they were trying to like make things all
like gritty and realistic it's just
great I think that's enough you suppose
we have to wait a while because you've
showered enough you soap did you soap up
did you lather use soap so what's this
see exactly I know they know
scrubbed yes you should have typed in
scrubbed genitals that would have been
great
OOP
hey Elvis no he did not
what movie ate my soul I don't think any
movie I mean many movies have eaten bits
and pieces of my soul the amazing
spider-man ate a bit of my soul
Theodore Rex was a special one I agree
that was a special one this muted now it
is demon souls is happening we want to
finish a police quest first though maybe
after we finished police quest next time
we do a group stream maybe we'll do
demon soul maybe there's too many you
know we need we I have like an
unofficial list of games that people
have asked us to play we need an
official like written down list so we
can check them off whenever we play them
I'm gonna play what I want play yeah
nice dream list or not alright nobody
want to tell me about this chicken is it
do you have to say something else like
instead of ask not sure chicken just say
chicken
talk to me yes I will watch the new
Supergirl TV show chicken hey Sonny you
sure mr. Goodwin while you was well you
were off on duty says RJ Jefferson
lettin PD custodian someone filled a
pair of patios full of cotton balls and
crammed them into Sergeant Dooley's
pigeonhole so there's a prankster
sunny my man you keeping the fat boy off
your back asks Jefferson I sure felt
sorry for Jack yesterday old Dooley was
really reaming him about his lo
activities we have a suspect no we have
a suspect say Sonny hey Sonny says RJ
better keep your eye on that female
officer she was eyeballing you the other
day
like a rat looking at a piece of cheese
ma same uh same I say if it is not Sonny
big man bonds how about my favorite cop
you should have been with me last night
I had such a good time I'd come back to
work just to get some rest on support Oh
Chuck wiseacre
okay so Jefferson Jack for the chicken
problem Jefferson is a suspect that's
the no that's the general Oh jack is
this a jack is low-performance suspect
oh and we're gonna go see him right I
think so I'm gonna ask about Jack oh we
get rid of chicken oh how interesting
the second that's gone okay
how fascinating
the Supergirl TV show everyone wants to
know my opinion because of my love of
course it looks fine it looks it's it's
exactly like I'm imagine in your head
rich a super girl TV show made for CBS
well it's exactly rappelled
it's it's it looks like a little it
looks like Supergirl meets Ugly Betty I
don't know if you know we are like The
Devil Wears Prada
where were you know she's an
underappreciated assistant at a big
highfalutin business right but she's
also Supergirl so it's I'm sure it's
gonna be fine I like the look of her it
seems to have is it have a bit of a
comedy tone a lighter tone yeah exactly
the new girl with superpowers that's
exactly what it is so sure you'll be
fine
I will watch it because Jack's pigeon
hole holds seven birthday cards you
don't need it you don't need it look at
ya
mm-hmm it's the anything special okay
stop fucking around with his birthday
cards
those are his birthday cards I want you
they might they might hold the key to
the chicken mystery check one of those
cards sit here I got you chicken for
your birthday
sure sure you're right hey have your I'm
thinking like a policeman no one's above
the law jackets true that's true
just cuz just cuz he's another cop don't
mean anything
what okay Russ the keeper of the
evidence Locker says that hey honey I
haven't seen anything new with your name
on it lately hey sorry honey I haven't
seen anything with your name on it just
rapidly yes you have super progeria it's
two years old
so I'm gonna save before I Drive my
Corvette is it good bad things happen my
drive
Jaka shoes no I I'm sure it will be fine
it will be acceptable it will be it will
be what a super girl TV show on CBS will
be it should meet your expectations as I
guess what I'm saying and it might be
fun maybe it was last time a network a
big major one of the major networks did
schlock what's it good what's in it like
Hercules the television series that
wasn't that wasn't like you know
syndication oh sure or there are
networks capable of doing schlock don't
they want like ultra realistic drama or
sitcom comedy well that's the thing
about the Supergirl shows it looks like
it's a little more lighthearted
okay and so that's that's what makes me
a little like why can I leave there's
something we have to do
oh I'm assuming there's something we
have to do I mean go where we're trapped
in this room oh we don't want that bulge
in our pants rich reality TV might be
100 percent schlock but it's not like
superhero action-adventure tried the
days of Knight Rider are long gone yeah
nc 73 no this is not by the same people
who made don't shit your pants don't be
silly this is a very old game Jay's
manhole wants to know whether or not
avocados are a great food or the
greatest food and the answer is both
avocados are green they're great the
green rich there are procedures they are
sticklers they are are sticklers yep get
it together
avocados are wonderful and brilliant and
I love them and everyone should eat
avocados all the time
yeah they rebooted night writer but it
lasted what one season
oh no I mean seven episodes lasted all
of two seconds
what's it like being old you know it's
fine well sucks well it's not oh it's
fine
you you know you know what it's like
being old you just constantly feel that
clock ticking no the older you get the
worse it is I don't it's it's great
hopefully it makes you a little calmer
and a little I remember when I was in
like grade school and I thought man I'm
gonna be so old once the year 2000 rolls
around I can't believe how old I'll be
when that happens model unfortunately I
got a whole long time you know before
that happened it's almost it's almost
like forever but it isn't it isn't
forever it catches up with you
eventually yeah
and when you when you when you hit that
point when you were you were like a kid
you thought wow 30 seems so far away and
then you're 38 and that's like oh my god
I'm gonna die any minute any minute now
any minute now you could but you could
die at any minute any there's there's
there's far more space behind me then
there isn't front of me no not if you're
doing it right Wow Wow rich guy start
doing it right beat more veggies eat
more veggies you live forever four
ounces of spinach a day means that
you'll never die that's how it works no
it's you know where's the blue room jack

wait where's the police station

police station is hold on searching for

these guys yeah I am going to write a
memo about this hot water situation the
place never has enough hot water I for

longer more comfortable showers okay

rumor that Sweet Cheeks Marie has the
hots for you you better watch your step
cuz those hookers will put their hooks
in you before you know it look Clark
speaking of girls like hoochie coochie
Hannah sure is one spicy dancer she
drove the guys completely crazy man I'll
tell you this much that nobody is going
to complain about the feminist themes in
these questions absolutely nobody you
don't think there's gonna be a
controversy about strong female you
oh I'm sorry a hunchback Jack that you
didn't get the email I got the email
that that we started streaming its
twitches weird about that sometimes
welcome to the stream and in the case
boys duly remind you they had punched
well the briefings might keep some of
those corrective memos out of your
pigeonhole blonds I'll find your seat
I'm sorry oh my god I'm sorry I heard
about that honey you stopped last night
who tried to negotiate her way out of a
ticket by exposing the upper parts of
her anatomy it's true it's all true
let's get feminist themes
strong strong female cast here sorry to
do Lisa's Medan we've received
information from the from the day
sergeant concerning a missing persons
report filed earlier this morning oh my
god okay yeah it seems that a Mexican
male Jack write this down in your notes
going up it seems that ain't Mexican
male physical description of 5/8 145 lbs
this is lbs what's that braids labels
145 black hair brown eyes by the name of
Jose Martinez my name is Josie Martinez
last seen by his wife two days ago
getting into a late-model
light blue Cadillac oh excuse me we've
been looking for a blue Cadillac why was
it just stolen I don't recall Lonny west
I think that's from something different
that wasn't that oh no we don't you
haven't been writing white what these
names were important for late oh no that
was
one that had crashed into the car
remember remember the car that crashed
yeah oh it was the one that shot that
how do we know he was the one that shot
well we know that the blue Cadillac was
the one that shot at the other car okay
and how do I know why he was associated
with that blue cat you told me to write
down the name okay I know what a seeder
heard from Martinez since this person
has some previous arrests involving
narcotic sales says Dooley hello
concluding the briefing be advised that
the this black Cadillac may be one of
the same as the one involved in the
recent murder of Lonnie West hello there
we go okay that was a gunshot then yeah
okay we have a partial license plate
number of l9 strict for they're all
connecting the pieces are all coming
deliver em proceeded to give everyone
their beat assignments for the day
concluding with yours Sonny Bonds your
call number will be 83 32 does I think
the same as it was before
great yes safe out there boys and girls
great we're keeping it we're giving it
say even a real keep it real keeping it
real yeah also someone who's reminding
me in Chad
there was a little Batman Arkham night
behind the scenes like talking to the
developers and something I know I was
really excited to hear and I know you'll
be really excited to hear too apparently
they came up with the design for the
Batmobile first and decided to design
Batman's suit after the Batmobile which
means that the gameplay will most
certainly revolve around the battle yeah
yeah I've heard the batma suit is
metallic so it can integrate in with the
Batmobile for things yeah so that means
we're gonna get a lot of Batmobile it
sounds like it'll be a great Mad Max
game put it in the desert we're good to
go based on the footage I've seen from
combat the Mad Max game it looks like
that
a great Batman game so we're basically
living in bizarro world we need some
mods to put a Batman suit on Mad Max to
put the Batmobile in the desert get out
in modders okay good so now we know that
the person who killed the guy in the
light blue late-model caddie possibly
Jose Martinez a Mexican male he's pretty
short short and little oh yeah yeah
maybe go to the cell rooms and take a
look at that let's talk to that drug
user daddy they picked up isn't there
are there holding cells here Oh mom's
Dooley girls aren't you assign enough
work to do go on get out of here moron
more radical oh you're right John Kela
apparently also in the new Arkham Knight
game you can make other characters bleed
I'm so worried that game was just gonna
be terrible I mean you know what the bad
boy bill does it drives Batman where he
needs to go mhm
Batman should never emphasize car combat
that's ridiculous
it is the Batmobile if you want to see
the Batmobile in a Batman game right
guess what
it's an Arkham Asylum it drives him to
the asylum that's what the Batmobile
does yes it should not do anything more
okay those are all right now we're ready
to do it
get back on that beat is that guy still
in the can
yeah why is in the shower still no look
in the end oh yeah he's been in there
all game it's probably a joke I don't
know what he want me to do was he dead
do you think he's dead this is what I'm
saying doc document loved to visit with
you Sonny
but there just isn't enough room in here
for the both he's not dead that's fine I
just want to make sure he's not like
it's just really constipated what if
that was like a an optional side mission
or is like who can who can just see if
this guy's dead don't worry about it
it's all good it's beautiful that's
filmmaking after-effects so so people
people don't know okay are you coming in
there okay all right you know what
that's fine Jane
alright ok so wait now where we going I
don't have it do we have a mission we're
just going on Patrol ok great I'm
assuming we're going to run into a
Cadillac right we still need to find
that light blue gate I've got to find a
drunk at some point oh oh wait why not
head to the jail see if you can talk to
the drunk guy that someone brought in ok
you tell me we're jealous and we'll go
jail is to the right and down wait we're
fully loaded now we're gonna go we're in
full on oh wait wait wait
why'd you walk around do you say yes I
did great would be really funny if I
didn't but I did
ok great did you save the game yes all
the way down and to the right
J does need to be mic 24/7 I agree okay
let's just see if we can talk to the
drug guy that that guy brought in maybe
he'll give us some more clues okay
that's what I would do if I was like
trying to work my way up to Detective
extra-mile you go the extra mile maybe
extra mile do some detective what are
you doing somebody complaints and you
weren't on patrol when you were supposed
to be and that the city is losing money
on tickets study you were supposed to be
writing because they care about the
money they don't really care about doing
good for the community
sure sure it's a business basically yeah
you have no business in the jail this
time
the jailer knows it and he won't let you
in yeah fair enough let's go let's do
our jobs or whatever how about that
respect this mask let's talk this this
guy here yeah slam-dunk done he goes
through the fence come on dude like you
put me in here and I'm going to sue your
whole department for false arrest it's
probably true yeah racial profiling yeah

said you know riches riches like my
supervisor I'm good cop and riches good
supervisor telling me good cop just to
do my fucking job and I'm like but what
about the crimes we're loose key you
trying to convince me that we're loose
cannons right we have to do these things

happens here no okay so we're now we're
on patrol I think so yes great okay four
drunks no drunks I lied it'll tell us

thoughts on Kevin Smith no no thanks was

have on Kevin Smith great oh and Jason
Mewes is a fucking dirtbag yeah there
you go I've CIA ended up going with
somebody to see them live one side and
it was Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes and
God he's just a scumbag did horrible
horrible things yeah he looks about 20
years older than he is because he's
nothing but drugs misery right misery I
have a complicated relationship with
Kevin Smith it's a one side of a
relationship because he doesn't know who
I am of course but you know clerks is
one of those movies that when you're
young and interested in filmmaking opens
your eyes
to the fact that just anyone can make a
movie it was amazing like it didn't and
I don't mean that negatively because but
like it doesn't look good you know like
it looks cheap oh where is it god damn
it God rich yeah well you you drive Jack
I'm not I'm not even gonna get it to it
but that was great
let's see you do this not let's see you
do this all right I just think he's
right but so so clerks was one of those
things I was really into filmmaking I
was really into comedy and me and my
cousin were making small you know videos
and and we see clerks and it just opened
our eyes to a whole worlds of
possibilities in and he did that for a
lot of young filmmakers so he will
forever have all my Jesus Christ have a
place of a place in film history I think
and he's made some bad movies and now he
I don't know what he does anymore I mean
most directors have made some bad movies
right even if they've made good ones
before oh my god he's right next to you
rich don't crash into him saving right
now what's a 10-4 over and out oh right

chase he's coming right for you Oh

don't know what's the shortcut for
dispatch though with a shortcut
