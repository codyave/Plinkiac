tell you about the afterbirth I like it
a lot that's a good guess it's a good
game it's a good game that I play a lot
and I recommend that you play it but I
don't want you to think that I'm forcing
my opinions on you that was a good
Yiddish yeah why don't over this and I
know that's I know the Jewish I'm not a
hundred percent sure that's Yiddish know
somebody's saying I'll you dishes like
it's German Jewish i'm not entirely sure

fuck out of here if you want to just
request impressions for me to do yes t
Carlisle that that's fine I'm sure I'm
just well oh I forgot what he says now
what do we do when we fall I will we get
back up this is something I want you to
think about now what I'm not saying is
that if you stay down for a little bit

brings me here this tells me nothing and
what happened to you just hold it over
what's up there fuck you fuck you and
fuck you okay so what is it here mapping
human neural tissue is not a simple task
especially with the ever changing data
of a live subject however is much easier
to get a good day at pull when the
pattern remains constant and still
cannot by skill upgrades sounds bad
scanned ko'd guards generate a random
bonus Oh dead unit scanned will give
permanent skill upgrades oh so if you
kill someone so there's incentive for
killing people apparently for him for
Draco interesting interesting so I can't
level him up he's just got a murder
people interesting very interesting
interesting I'm gonna murder somebody oh

Rock o ye whatever your thoughts on and
said what are your thoughts on inception
matters I haven't seen it oh I enjoyed
it it's fun it's like if if you think
about it you know everyone likes to oh
she's silent when she sprints oh nice
she's not making any noise um no I think
everyone has close enough that made
noise everyone thinks too hardly about
inception if you think about it as like
just a sci-fi action movie it's fun it
has some big ideas and and some neat
action sequences it's just try not to
think too hard about it because the kids
complicated oh that's right winners
losers do their best winners go home and
fuck the prom queen The Rock The Rock
was the best movie was it what is he
saying the untouchables they bring all
something you bring up never never bring
a knife to a gun no no that's Crocodile
Dundee no fucking outline untundi is oh
yeah you're right never bring a knife to
a gun okay yeah they hit you back you
hit them harder something like that
something like that oh my god krob Becky
look at her but it is so big she looks
like one of those etc etc thank you krob
krob krob krob but so I liked inception
I I think it's a fun movie watch the
Chicago why I remember that much yeah

it seems kind of silly it has admittedly
it's been a really long time since I've
seen memento but I remember it being
just fine the way it is but hospital
I'll see what would but I and give a
fuck out of here oh it isn't Nolan
someone else is remaking memento jesus H
Christ we make snow have a turnaround
time of four years but but for is sad
the rebate we're already remaking the
dark knight rises we're not going to
remake Batman Begins or the dark knight
we're just gonna skip right to remaking
the dark knight rises oh I need this for
the guy the guy with the the trait that
lets them gain skills from murdering
yeah here's a awed meant that lets the
alarm not go up when you murder people
hmm you know what that is that some
great synergy that is some amazing
fucking synergy great buy it and do it I
think I can pass this off or do I have
to know I think I have to install it and
I think I need to bring him in here for
this I'm just writing which is fine
strawberry pancakes yeah well I think
where were you we will eventually play
more undertale I want to play more
undertale and we were actually thinking
about that tonight but we had some stuff
we want to do we knew there'd be a lot
of talking we have the new the tip thing
and all that exactly so yeah we knew
tonight wasn't gonna be a good day to do
it but yes we do plan on playing and
possibly finishing undertale I don't
know how far we got
but uh oh yeah i'm not sure i'm swimming
there's ways to go sure so space cop you
know it was announced that space cop is
you know they're trying to get it out
this year oh yeah and it will be remade
by next December that's the less our fun
that's our plan internally is we want it
we want to completely remake it and have
the new one out by December 2016 that is
uh but I mean you know obviously it
probably won't happen but that's our
plan you're right a Michelle Hollywood

about the princess bride lately this is
an awesome movie it's an awesome movie
but it like is it an anniversary or
something I don't know it's an awesome
movie he climbed up the mountain

throat like wiggling her throat which L

it puts the lotion and it puts the
lotion in the basket it puts the lotion

Edgar from men in black and Plagueis

i can see you agent oh I sound like Sam
the Blue Eagle from the Muppets no Sam
is Buffalo Bill meets Kermit oh you've
you've got some you've got some some
sandy Eagle in there no but yeah if you
add Kermit then you get sandy Eagle so
if you'd start with Buffalo Bill and
then out of little Kermit you get Sam
the Eagle when I am here for you what I
what I do remove this stiff George Lucas
is just tone down Kermit the Frog
O'Grady frogs urine you're actually this
one's a little slower you know oh yeah

less sure of himself duller it's like
dollar Herman yeah that's pretty great
nasty flot how much you think the movies

alien look a little like cooler I'd be
great talking with with somebody last
night yeah we're on the ride home yeah
about how they named the fan of s this
person thought you know phantom is
actually kind of a neat name The Phantom
is looking for the meaning behind it
what was what was that what was that
referring to sure Palpatine or was it
was the trade fitter what was the better
man yeah I said did he just thought the
Phantom was a cool word he was looking
for something affair with no I'm really
phantom what's another word I can go
with phantom phantom phantom opera well
I've done that phantom guys he said you
know cuz because the first one was
supposed to be like a mystery wasn't it
I yeah sure why not so but you you
actually things like he was just like a
phantom sounds cool am I in my head in
my head yes that's great uh maybe the UM
the phantom society yeah The Phantom

undertale which reminds them of
earthbound we probably won't get around
to her phone but we couldn't i don't
know like i like respond oh oh my god oh
my god what no um I check that I real
there there olivion says despite riches
earlier dismissal I think you should try
grow home it's a fun 3d platformer and
you can probably finish it in one stream
grow home Rome gone home bat or please
play police quest to grow home what was
I don't even remember that what was that
and why did I dismiss it I haven't I
just did I probably have a reason I have
a reason for everything i do grow home
exactly the things that don't have
reasons for
oh yeah this looks adorable that little
robot man I don't I honestly don't
remember dismissing this you might have
you might have dismissed gone home maybe
yeah maybe there was a miscommunication
i will i will add grow home to the games
we should play list okay um because yeah
that looks adorable okay now if you'll
excuse me I've been trying to check to
see if the princess bride is appropriate
for my children for like 20 much we even
need to do this because I love this app
let's see here action style violence
includes a torture machine sword fights
one to the death a death by poisoning
quicksand fire pits shrieking eels
menacing rous is a character makes
reference to killing herself oh that one
language one use of son of a bitch also
but a great use of set of a bitch you
killed my father you son of a bitch oh
my god but here's here's why they can't
watch it they use my god and jesus as an
exclamation you know what have to
explain what Jesus's is that essentially
what this means is just lazy parenting
no I already have you know I have radar
day night I know I'm giving you shit
daddy what's that T on the wall why does
that t have a bloody manner we've had
some we've had some conversations oh

smiles at you when you sing songs about
him it's great it's great it's great
everybody loves them everybody loves

elevator is
that's great that you know where the
elevator is that really is great I don't
think you understand this blink um it's
great to know where the elevator it's
been a while since I played it oh that's
a good question well I wonder what the
someone is wondering what the kids media
app says for Passion of the Christ it
just is just gonna say great movie boom
pesi all I hate detention centers yeah
yeah these are these are unnecessarily
hard missions oh my god so like positive
role models nun sex nun language nun
consumerism done drinking drugs and
smoking nun violence all five notches
ticked extremely graphic and intense
violence this is for Passion of the
Christ including whipping and
crucifixion could cause nightmare in
your younger children very disturbing
and violent images involving Jesus Satan
Judas and others but that's fine
Christian movie is a fine Christian
movie we're not gonna show buts I'm very
sorry I'm not gonna show you my butt oh

becomes too full of stuff and you have
to throw it out what do you put in your

my denial of games that we play a set
even a second time or or often as is the
case with FTL is um is to make sure we
keep the stream fresh yeah but we should
we always play new games every those
games we come back to frequently yeah
