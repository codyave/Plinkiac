Striker1121, um, just collect your money now.
I am not skipping the cutscene.
Oh, that's right.
I did chant jimmy jams during the Dark Souls thing.
Eh, I'm fine.
I don't need to.
Besides, chanting jimmy jams is not going to help my goddamn Xbox.
Fucking piece of shit Xbox.
Wizardgee, Xbox, they, they're not very sensitive to feelings.
They're insenstive.
This is why they, they crash near the ends of highly successful no-death runs.
Xbox's don't give no shits.
Xbox is, like, fuck you, I'm gonna red ring.
Fuck you.
Oh, how much you pay for me?
Oh, too bad.
You got ringed, bitch.
That's, that's an Xbox.
They're highly insensitive.
I'm gonna say, it feels like we're back from this cutscene.
I wanna get the, the, the key to the underground that's in this room back here.
So I do have reason to come over here.
If, if you're waiting around to see if I'm gonna pull off the run, and you wanna be doing something else, it's gonna be a little while.
We got some, we got some hours left to go.
I, I fully understand if it's getting late and you wanna leave.
We're gonna be around probably till 2 A.M.
Jack, this is my Xbox.
I know you wanna make videos smashing into freezes again, but I'm gonna want another Xbox if we do that.
It's the only way I can play this game.
Dead Rising is why I put up with 360.
All right.
I'm gonna take care of some business while this is running.
Actually, there's only one new one.
Okay.
Secksweirdo, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
How come Dead Rising 1 hasn't gotten a port when the others have?
I've heard, and I don't know if it's true because I've heard, I've heard the opposite, too, conflicting reports that the engine they use for Dead Rising 1 was some kind of weird, weird Japanese engine that was difficult to port, uh, stuff over to Windows on.
That's what I've heard.
I've also heard people say, oh,  that's not true.
So I don't, I don't know.
I don't know.
Oop.
Fuck.
There's my car.
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.
Fuck.
Yeah, that's where I wanna go.
I wanna turn around.
Go exactly the opposite way.
You can stop feeling I didn't save.
I'm going to, I'm actually headed to the saving...excuse me, the saving place.
For saves.
Let's save, let's save in the bathroom.
I, I do have to go to Betty.
FlushyPatch, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
All right, I'm gonna make some quickstep and then, by then, it oughta be about time to, uh, start the final leg of, uh, 72-hour mode here.
Won't do that anymore.
Also, that won't do anymore either.
Inventory just got a lot lighter.
Wrong button.
Dammit.
There we go.
I've never done that before!
All right, come on, get back to yonder safe house.
Dammit.
Holy, there are a fuck ton of zombies.
Yes, we have talked about Mad Max already.
It's fucking awesome.
The conclusion we all came to was, you need to stop what you're doing and watch Mad Max immediately, if not sooner.
Preferably sooner, because that movie needs to make money, so they make more kickass, brutal, R-rated action movies with practical effects.
Uh, VGDennis, you could argue that you're late, or you could argue that you're right back to where we were when the last one glitched out on me.
MrParasaur, you said it should've been called Mad Furiosa.
You are completely wrong.
Completely wrong.
Comically wrong.
It's, it, he has exactly as much screen time as he had in The Road Warrior.
I mean, he's, he, yeah, no, you're wrong.
You know what?
Paul can fucking wait.
Hurry up, Izzy.
Trying to stop fucking up myself here, but hurry up.
Fuck.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I don't need no weapons.
I'm Frank West.
I need to head soon, though.
Let's get outside, first.
Why are you running through the area that has the thickest amount of zombies, Izzy?
It's kind of stupid.
They won't all need to die.
Come on.
Come on.
FlushyPatch, I, I know it took five years, but I'm, I'm glad you're on board with me now.
Isabela is hot.
Stupid, fucking...ehh...meh, see, meh?!
I ate.
I ate.
I'm glad those fucking convicts are dead.
Oh, whoa.
Where the fuck were you?
Holy fuckballs, there are a lot of zombies.
There are so many zombies, and it's so fucking dark.
I can't see shit.
I'm gonna use my thord.
Call about Cheryl yet?
Because that's the last one.
Chat, what time does, uh, the, the, the photograph side mission start?
I'm gonna wait around a little bit for the call.
Since I'm so close to being absolutely perfect.
So close.
I'm gonna save!
I'm gonna save as soon as I get the call for this.
I don't wanna go back in there, save, come back out, get the call from Cheryl, and then have to go back in.
We're doing all of this at once.
You can't sa-, you have to be, you have to be at a save spot.
All right.
I'm gonna get the butcher.
Don't worry.
I have to do this first.
Cuz after the butcher, I can't do any of this.
And after I do this, I will have saved all of the survivors, and done all other side quests.
Which is fucking awesome.
Hey, this is, this is the side quest.
After this, all the side quests, uh, done.
And if she's gonna pose, I may as well get the free presitge points.
I love how everybody else in the room went to back away.
All right.
We're off to finish the game.
We'll be fine.
Oh, I forgot to save.
Oh, well.
No time now.
No time now.
We're racing the clock.
Racing the clock.
Holy shit, I beat the, the, I made it to the bathroom before the, the bathroom could load.
Wait a mintute.
I'm missing something here.
Where is the, where is the door?
It's gotta be down here.
There it is.
It's not great.
I may have time to get another chainsaw, though, so we're gonna deal with it.
All right.
All right.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Technically, Frank's been here three days.
But, the zombie outbreak's been going on for longer than that.
It was going on before Frank West shows up at the mall.
You want me to give your friend a shoutout?
Sure.
Hey, Colonel.
You're cool, bro.
Ow.
Ow.
Yes, I know, I know the mini chainsaws are overpowered.
I feel cheap using them, but it's all for the sake of doing a no-death run.
Americans are fat.
Did you know Americans are fat?
All right, is there anything to eat in here?
I'm not doing terrible on health, but better safe than sorry.
All right.
All right.
Time for fucking around.
Technically, there isn't.
Earlier we get on this shit, the better.
What?
Oh, whoops.
I did not want to do that.
Not really.
Just gonna wait this one out.
So, I don't know how to feel about that fucking Xbox freeze bullshit.
It's soiled my no-death run.
It took my no-death run, and my Xbox pulled down its pants, and pissed all over it.
I know there are points to be had, but I'm gonna have plenty of time to kill after the next couple missions.
Plenty of time to kill.
We'll be fine.
Can I save in here?
I can.
So you're saying, unless I die in-game and the system crashes, it's still a no-death run, but you have failed to do is a single segment no-death run.
Yeah, I know.
It would feel so much better if it were a single segment.
But it still feels good.
This is my best Dead Rising run ever.
Which is why I'm gonna die in the end.
The very end.
I know it.
Ah, yes, the game froze a while back.
I've been saving this time, though.
So, we started nearby.
It froze right before, right after finishing the, the bomb run.
You know, now I'm worried it's going to freeze while I'm saving, and ruin the save.
All right, I have never even played Dead Rising 3.
Now, recently, very recently, one of you guys very generously, uh, gifted me a copy of Dead Rising 3.
I haven't gotten around to playing it yet.
I kinda wanna play through the whole series, so after this, I dunno, I dunno if I'm gonna stream it.
If I do stream it, it won't be a no-death run.
I, then I'm gonna play through Dead Rising 2, and then, uh...shit...then, uh, I'll get around to 3.
I'm going the right way, aren't I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate this corridor.
Dead Rising 2 will not be Sunday.
I got other plans with Jack.
I know, I know regular Dead Rising 2 is, is the canon Dead Rising 2, but Off the Record has Frank West.
So, there's that.
I'm not sure which one I'll play though.
I, I have both.
Do I want canon, or do I want Frank West?
Probably Frank West, but I'm not convinced yet.
Not 100%.
TinyTurnip, have a, have a nice nap.
Sleep well.
Thank you for showing up.
Anybody else feel like taking a nap?
We've, we've got a chunk of game left, so if you wanna go, now's as good a time as any.
I completely understand.
Grab one of those flashlights.
It's dark.
Comically, comically dark.
All right, Jack.
Good night.
Thanks for, thanks for chatting with everybody.
Making the silent, nearly silent stream a bit more exciting.
We're, we're damn near at the end of it, of, of story stuff.
Now it's Jessie.
It's kinda tragic.
Jessie and Brad are the reason you can't save everybody with the, uh, true ending card they give you.
Ending A, whatever they wanna call it.
Did she ever get bitten?
It's possible, uh, Barnaby did something.
I don't think you even necessarily have to get bit in this universe.
I, I'm assuming, like, a wasp sting might do it.
Yeah, there is a way to save Jessie and Brad.
You just can't get the good ending.
You have to get one of the lesser endings.
You st-, basically, stop the story before they die in the story.
So, Otis, Otis abandoned his end of the mall.
Fucking Otis.
And, uh, he took everyone else with him.
Hi, Jess.
Oop, fucked that up.
So, now, uh, we're on our own for a while.
What, uh, what time does the next thing happen?
All right.
It actually doesn't say.
All right.
Well, technically, I'm, I'm done, but I know there's one more thing I, I can do, and I need to do, to get the ultimate good true whatever final bestest amazing amaze-mo wonderment ending.
But, uh, yeah, we got, we got time to fuck around here.
Actually, I'm gonna, while I'm in this safe room, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna let this run for a bit.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Okay.
I am back.
So, how we doing?
That is a nice thord.
That's the thord I got for killing the cult guy.
It's still, still lasted.
It's a good thord.
All right.
Let's go, let's go play around in this mall.
Technically, I could, I could just hang out in the safe room for twelve hours gametime and, uh, accomplish most of my goals.
But we're not gonna do that.
That's not fun.
We're gonna, we're gonna play around in this zombie funhouse.
Save?
Uh, yeah.
That's a good point.
I'll save.
We could, we could track down stickers, take pictures of, uh, stuff.
It, it would be hilariously tragic if I died while fucking around, but...do you want, do you want the rest of this stream to be just this?
Sitting here like this?
No, we're doing something.
Yeah, I'm, I'm definitely, first thing I'm doing is we're going to the orange juice store, and we're gonna make some health.
Uh, I'm going to try to get to level 50.
I don't know if that's possible.
Like, mathetmatically, I'm not sure if I can.
But, uh, we'll, I'll, I'll do my best.
Actually, waiting around in this room while I went to the bathroom, probably didn't help the cause, but whatever.
Fuck it.
Did I show you guys the showerhead?
Showerhead's great.
Actually, you know what, taking the elevator down might not be quicker.
I might have goofed there.
But, no big deal.
No big deal.
We, we've managed to do everything, so it didn't hurt me any.
What?
What's this?
Why, what's going on?
What could this be?
All right, now those guys, they're gonna be how I attempt to level up.
You get something, like, 5,000, uh, Prestige Points a kill.
So if I'm gonna do it...shit...it's gonna be by killing special forces assholes.
I'm gonna try not to die.
Oh, fuck.
Five of them?
All right, we're just running.
That's greater numbers than I can handle.
Not with a, not with a dying chainsaw.
Don't need that shit anymore.
All right.
Let's find some special forces assholes.
Fucking die.
Well, we're almost leveled.
We'll get to 47...
Let's make our way to the chainsaw.
Chainsaw will be a lot of help.
Cheap, but we're in no-die mode.
Nice.
Ooh, Attack Up.
That's a good one.
What are my, what are my stats?
Life, throw distance...gotta get that throw distance!
Sorry.
That was silly.
You fucking zombie.
OP chainsaw.
Oscar Percival Chainsaw.
That's, that's its name.
OP.
All right.
Need some more guys to kill.
Right down there.
Eh, food court.
How was Dead Rising 2 and 3?
Two is okay.
It's so much easier, I don't enjoy it as much.
Uh, three, people say it's bad.
I haven't played it.
It's recently been...
I know there's a...oh, that's just...
Oh, fuck you.
That guy liked food court much.
Um, I just had a thought I was gonna do something, and I forgot what I was gonna do.
Something I wanted to get that would help make things...easier?
God.
What was I gonna do?
Was I gonna get a book?
I clean forgot.
Oh, I remember what I was gonna get now.
I was gonna get...
Oh, fuck.
I forgot about that.
We're, we're taking the long way.
We're not fucking with that shit.
A large open space, then I get close to fight here.
Moving on.
All right.
Avoid the park.
There we go.
That helps.
That helps a lot.
All right.
So, so, that's our life now.
We're, we're killing special forces guys, and, uh, killing special forces guys.
I should probably get rid of my thord.
It's of limited usefulness now.
Certainly will
Still not able to, that's amazing.
Don't make 'em like they used to.
I could sword the SWAT guys, but they're dangerous.
I'm not fucking around with SWAT guys.
There's gotta be some SWAT motherfuckers here somewhere.
There's no way there aren't.
Are there no SWAT to murder?
I mean, what the fuck?
Here we go.
Got two.
There's one more down here.
It's gonna be dangerous.
Oh, there we go.
Right to my side.
Be careful.
Where are...some of the blenders?
Maybe it's something for using all of the blood...
Where is SWAT?
Where is SWAT?
Goddammit.
It's corner of...
This is as far as SWAT goes.
Fuck.
Flying around.
Flying around.
Uh, there are PP logos on everything now because I grabbed the book that let's you see what genre something is.
Like, if there's horror going on, the PP logo will flare up over it.
Uh, when I wanna grab some queens later, uh, it'll help find those a lot easier because the queens will show up, uh, as a green PP logo.
The queen zombies.
Oop, that's not what I wanted.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.ffff
Oh, I keep hearing a gunshot echo.
I think there are special forces in the distance.
It's, it's from the, uh, the sound playing through the stream.
Did I miss somebody?
Nope.
Nope, I didn't.
While I'm here, I'm gonna grab my orange juice.
Almost at 48.
Maybe I can do, uh, level 50.
That would be fucking awesome.
Stream's still streaming okay
All right.
Good, good.
No cover mechanic?
No cover mechanic.
To be fair, 90% of the game is a zombie game.
That would be kind of silly.
Fucking die.
Ah, there's a blender.
Let's get closer to...
Nice.
I had, I had this machete in my inventory ever since, uh, the hatchet man scoop.
All right.
Where are you special forces jackasses?
Oop.
Didn't do exactly what I thought I was gonna do there.
Dare I say, that's more efficient than shooting them.
Oh, you're right there.
Now you're not.
I think there's a blender in the supermarket`, so I'm gonna head that way.
Fuckers.
Fuckers.
Ba-boom.
All right.
Did not forget to save.
Good call.
Good call, LardSavick.
I'm sure other people have said it, too.
Into the supermarket.
Oh, no.
I'm not going for the 52,000 zombie achievement.
I, I don't even have time to now, anyway.
I am trying to get to level 50 before the game ends.
Because that would be awesome.
I know it's around here somewhere.
Here we go.
Almost had a machete.
Kind of sad.
See what's over here.
Well, that didn't make any sense.
Uh, maybe there is a blender in here.
There's not a blender in here.
Where are other blender I'm forgetting about?
One in the movie theater.
This is not a big deal.
I believe it's 10,000 points.
That's only two special forces kills, so not a big deal.
No reason not to eat.
Oh, is there two blenders in the movie theater?
All right.
Well, then we're going back to the movie theater.
Nice to have goals.
Time I have?
All right.
As long as I go see Isabela by 10AM, we're golden.
Oh, it's gone.
Farewell, my friend.
Thord work as well?
Eh, it worked okay.
A little bit slower.
Fuck.
Better get some orange juice before anything else.
Cuz a dead Frank is a bad Frank.
And, uh, we'll bring a pie to the blender.
Why not?
A pie.
Hot damn.
I might actually make it to level 50 in one run.
That's, that's fucking awesome.
You notice I'm talking a bit more now that there's, there's less, uh, stress.
Less concentration.
All right.
Where's the other one in the theater?
All right, that's the one I used...oh!
Right next to it.
Motherfucker.
Pie, and, uh, chips.
We'll get pie and chips.
Zombie.
Well, that's the last thing I need right now.
All right.
I'm assuming there's one in the food court I've missed then.
So now I'm over my way towards the food court.
Fuck fuck fuck.
Level up!
Life?
All right!
All right!
There is probably a blender in the food court I missed.
I'll get a paltry 10,000 points.
Actually, the last upgrade, unless you get two for the last one, is the zombie one.
This sword is fucking great.
It's made of admintium.
Adamintium.
Whatever.
Die.
Fucking die.
Do not wanna die this close to the end.
Coffee shop and Al Fresca.
All right.
We'll hit that level two.
Fuck.
Die.
Some ovens I missed?
Add up all the weapons.
Laser sword stopped working.
Fuck that.
Oh, fuck off.
That's gotta be all of them in this area, right?
That was just an insane number of special forces dudes.
Pretty sure I used that blender once, but I'm not 100%.
Raw meat.
Mmm, raw meat.
And, what do we got?
Cooking oil!
Raw meat and cooking oil.
Yum.
Zom...Zombait.
Any use for that anymore.
All right.
I know I used that blender a fuckton.
Yeah.
All right.
So we gotta find this blender in Al Fresa Plaza.
I think we used this oven, but I'm gonna make sure.
Nope, it's not.
Yeah, I've used it.
All right.
That last blender.
That sword is a trooper.
A real American hero.
How long till the helicopter?
I should get a phone alert two hours before.
All right.
Oh, this plaza is death.
Fortunately, the zombies are fucking with the special forces guys.
Sword's not...I'll drop that.
Obviously.
Go back and get uncooked pizza.
Use that last oven.
See if we can get a special bonus for that.
Thord almost dead.
Fuck you.
Live dangerously.
Fuck.
Pizza and, uh, yogurt.
Zombait?
No, I don't want Zombait.
What time we got?
All right.
All right.
Gonna hit up that last oven, and then that's it.
This is fun.
Get 'em, zombies!
Get 'em!
All right.
Not bad at all.
Sword keeps on rocking.
Love me some big chainsaw.
I think, I think I'm guaranteed 40 at this point.
I'm pretty sure I get points after the story is over, which should be enough.
Level Max!
We did it!
Fuck you!
This is the most amazing Dead Rising run that has ever happened in the history of ever.
I'll toot my own fucking horn.
This is fucking awesome.
Yeah, now I just have to not die.
Special forces?
I knew I'd run into you guys.
Die!
Oh, fun's over
Chainsaw died.
Sword's still kicking.
Almost there.
Oh, I didn't make it.
Noble effort, though.
Fuck you, zombie.
Yeah!
Something I'm missing over here.
Something I wanna grab.
There it is.
Never got to show you guys this thing.
All right.
Doesn't work on special forces guys, which I guess is not a shock.
But...watch this, watch this!
Almost there.
We're almost there.
Bam!
I'm gonna save.I'm gonna save.
Like, even if I don't get to the helicopter, I'll get an ending, and, and technically, it will have been a no-death run.
So, phlbttth.
Uh, yeah, for people asking, I made a, a new profile.
Which was a good thing I did because we did have another Xbox freeze issue, cuz the Xbox is a decrepit piece of shit.
Yes, SWAT killed all of the zombies.
So now I have nothing to do but get to the helicopter.
Tried to take Isabela with me.
She wouldn't come.
Izzy would have nothing to do with this.
Her loss.
With, uh, more than a little time to spare.
Oh, my god.
Think I'm gonna take another bathroom run.
Oh, wow.
All right.
Did the Xbox melt down?
Almost there.
Less than an in-game hour.
Zombie walk?
Yeah, I think I can manage Zombie walk.
This is what you get for, uh, top, the, the highest level.
Don't, don't spoil things, chat.
Don't spoil things.
I've never played around with the zombie walk, much.
It's kind of amusing.
I, I, I love the look on his face.
Yes, it makes the zombies think you're one of them.
I, it's mostly an easter egg.
Cuz really, it's kind of completely useless.
Cuz if you're rescuing people, you can't walk this slow.
Plus the zombies would attack me, survivors who aren't you, anyway.
But it's fun.
This game is all about having fun.
Am I going to watch the Hawks tomorrow?
I'm probably gonna be here streaming.
If they, if they get to the Stanley Cup Finals, I'll make sure I watch those games.
But we'll see.
Yeah, there we go.
Enjoy it, people.
Oh, the game's out at two?
That's werird.
Now, I'm sure everyone has figured out what overtime mode is by now.
But if there were an overtime mode, would not that have been the fucking perfect ending to a zombie movie?
I mean, just absolutely perfect?
And I'm totally doing overtime mode.
I'm, I'm happy enough with the way this game went tonight, even if I'm not successful at overtime.
I got, I did get an ending, and I didn't die.
So, good!
You don't, don't agree that's a perfect zombie movie ending?
I, I think, the classic Romero zombie movies are horribly depressing.
I mean, first one ends with, uh, what's-his-face getting shot by the people, by the human beings.
The second one ends with him taking off in a helicopter that's almost out of fuel, and they have no idea what the fuck they're going to do.
Classically, zombie movies have dark endings.
Anybody who wants to leave now, we can, we can officially say I've done a no-death run.
So, no, no shame in leaving now.
But I'm, I'm gonna keep playing until I get to the end-end, or die.
Possibly die.
Yeah, Kosper, the original ending to Dawn of the Dead, they fucking killed themselves.
OnBrunch says it's a good ending, but not a good ending.
There's more.
There's more.
How long is overtime mode?
Overtime mode can bare-, uh, can vary.
There, there's still a timer, but you can finish overtime mode before the timer.
Actually, you need to.
If you don't finish overtime mode before the time runs, you die.
So, overtime mode is a, is as long as it takes me to finish overtime mode.
Look at that.
Look at that.
This is great.
Fucking great.
Uh, HellCopter, there are over 50 survivors, but by completing story mode, some characters die.
Good night, JohnKilo.
Or if you're saying good night to somebody else, good night to that person.
I, I have my reason for not saving there.
I will be safe.
For everyone who is wondering why Frank didn't get infected, he is.
All right.
Here we go.
All right.
You guys want a picture?
All right.
What do all I need to get, and where is it?
OzMike, I think, I think it would be relatively safe to get food.
Unless you're going out to get food.
All right.
There's stuff over here I need?
Development fluid, or something.
Might be in the other photo place.
Oh, well.
Oh, well.
It's fine.
First-aid kit.
You guys are gonna get fucking chainsawed.
Know what, you know what, fuck the machine gun.
Chainsaw, better than machine gun.
Milk or orange juice?
Why isn't the arrow active?
There we go.
There we go.
Problem solved.
Apparently, it's under me.
No big deal.
All right.
What else?
Yay, I got an achievement.
Shut up.
Wait.
Probably smart to sec-, set my next objective first.
There we go.
Got to it before the beeps.
Of course I'm fighting back.
It's getting late.
Those queens are the bee, in the little jar, that destroy whole groups of zombies.
The zombies in this game are the result of parasitic wasps.
What do you know, I can stealth them.
Oh.
He's right in front of me.
Gotta be careful of that chainsaw.
It's not gonna last forever.
Shit.
Can't open in overtime mode.
Okay.
All right.
So we gotta get there the hard way.
Gotta go around.
No big deal.
For what it's worth, I'm getting tired, too.
I'm gonna see this through, though.
Shit.
Shut up.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Whoo, boy!
I want blood now.
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.
Oh, it's okay.
Everyone's fine.
We're fine.
Oh, I accidentally got rid of my quickstep.
Eh, that's okay.
I don't need quickstep anymore.
Jesus fuck.
I, I just about shat myself.
Damn near shat myself.
I don't wanna do that again.
Fucking die.
In groups, they're dangerous.
All right.
Think all I need now are the queens.
Yep.
Fuck.
Fucking hell.
I'm saving.
I'm saving.
Oh.
One health.
Well, that's something.
It's something.
Die, die, die, die!
Which route to Izzy?
Need some more juice.
I fucking hate you guys.
Oh, not enough room for it.
And I'm not giving up any of that other stuff, so off we go.
Find the stairs.
I am really getting fatigued.
Oh, fuck.
Good night, everybody who needs to go to sleep.
Let's grab 'em all.
Let's juice.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Special forces guys are officialy scaring me now.
We're getting close.
There's gonna be some queen boobery.
Oh, god.
Is my Xbox gonna freak out?
We may actually red ring before this is over.
All right.
Oh, that's right.
I gotta get the generator.
All right.
Home stretch, home stretch.
I just know at the worst possible moment my chainsaw is gonna give out.
I just knows it.
In my blood.
Good night, Krieger.
Good night, anybody.
Nobody is obligated to stay.
I know this is a long-ass stream.
So a no-, no-death run is, is longer than I even thought it would be.
Here's the...helicopter crash.
Oh, anybody can stay.
I'm just saying, you don't have to feel obligated.
No, I, I will not be in the Half in the Bag, uh, Mad Max review.
My view, though: go see it.
Mad Max is fucking awesome.
Oh.
Don't forget the generator.
Went through all this for it, and forget the generator.
That would suck.
I hate that helicopter.
The zombie walk won't help me with the helicopter coming.
Plus, I've gotta get a bunch of queens and get all this shit back to Isabela.
Before time is up.
I am stockpiling queens because Isabela's gonna need them to make the cure, or the, not the cure, but the, what do you call it?
I's not even a vaccination, either.
The delay.
She's gonna need it to make the delay.
The suppressant.
All right.
Halfway there with the queens.
Oop.
Not the zombies I'm looking for.
Here you are.
One.
This isn't worth my wait.
Let's see...Wonderland Plaza.
I might grab another chainsaw.
Oh, fuckers.
Four more.
Nope.
That's not a queen.
Where are the fucking queens when you need one?
Nope, nope, nope.
There we go.
Three more.
Fuckers.
Zombait now, that's not useful.
Two more.
The Zombait, the reason I'm throwing that away is that attracts zombies to you.
It's useful when you're escorting survivors, less so any other time.
Looking for the queens.
Fuck off.
Goodbye, flashlight.
Ooh, milk.
Goodbye, milk.
There's still one more.
Aw, yeah!
Damn near there.
Just in case this triggers a cutscene, I'm gonna go grab some weapons.
In case this triggers something I can't come back from
I don't think it will, but...
I'm Frank West, I don't need any damn weapons.
Uh, yeah.
We're good.
We're good.
We're, we're almost there.
Almost there.
Yeah, I'm, I'm at the studio.
My, my home internet sucks.
As far as the, the last boss, I have a strategy I'm going to try.
I don't know that it's going to work.
Quickstep and mini chainsaw.
Yeah, that won't work.
You have to fight the last boss barehanded.
They take away your inventory.
No weapons.
No chainsaw.
No food items.
It's gonna be fun!
Yeah, we're, we're on the last, we're on, this is the stretch.
This is the home fucking stretch here.
Yeah, it's a cool fistfight, if you don't lose.
Isabela, come on.
You fucking, fucking piece of shit Xbox.
All right.
All right.
Almost.
Almost.
It wasn't a red ring.
It just froze.
All right.
Where did I fucking save?
All right.
I just gotta grab some weapons.
I do have that last queen, though.
We don't have to run around for queens.
Yeah, if it freezes just after I beat the final fight, I will call it.
Fucking piece of shit.
Take a knife.
I hate you fuckers.
Probably wine in here.
I'll take coffee creamer.
I'll, I'll accept merch.
Ooh.
I need health.
Health good, health good.
Yeah, we won't need you anymore.
I'll take your knife.
If I die before I get back, does it count?
Uh, yes, because I'm anal.
I'm anal enough that I would say that counts.
All right.
Fortunately, we basically are back to where I was.
How do I like Dead Rising in comparison to the second?
I like the first one more.
I like the tighter time limits.
I, I like the tension because it's more difficult.
I like the fact that it's more difficult to escort survivors.
I feel the, the second one's a little bit watered down in the difficulty department.
Still fun.
There's still some fun stuff.
Certainly the combo weapons are fun.
But, um, yeah, I, I, I like the difficulty in the first one, and I like the protagonist a lot more.
I think Chuck Greene, he's the protagonist in Dead Rising 2, is kind of, kind of boring.
His personality is, he, he has a daughter.
He cares about his daughter.
They took the cheap and easy route, rather than making him a fun person that you want to root for.
I mean, you still root for him because he's got a daughter, but he's not a fun character himself.
Stonewall89 says, yeah, but honestly, Rich, is it really watered-down difficulty if just they fixed the stupid AI and made the AI half-competent?
That is what makes the difficulty watered down.
There, you might not even bother escorting survivors.
They, they just run back to the, they run right back through all the zombies.
They, they, you never really have to tend to them.
They can handle themselves.
They just run back to the safe house.
They follow you perfectly, and you don't have to worry about it.
For the most part.
There's no challenge to rescuing people in, in Dead Rising 2.
Not skipping the cutscenes.
We've been over this with me.
Captain Illogical.
Goodnight, JimmyJam5.
Okay.
SteampunkGirl, and BlickSputtedZebra, black spotted zebra, I'm assuming...thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
I have not played Dead Rising 3 yet.
Somebody gifted it to me recently.
It was very generous.
Looking forward to getting to it, but haven't gotten around to it yet.
Isabela, don't let go of my hand.
Why are you so difficult?
Fuck it.
These tunnels don't make any kind of fucking sense, do they?
And it's under a mall.
What the fuck is...they built the mall on ancient Greek ruins?
They built the mall on top of the aquaducts?
This is insane.
Always be holding hands.
Aughh!
All right.
Yes!
I'll give Dead Rising 2 this much.
I think Dead Rising 2 has a, a better overtime mode.
Not by much.
I mean, it's the same basic thing where you have to do a fetch quest, and then things happen.
But the things that happen are more interesting.
Yes, I have played the Dead Rising 2, uh, Xbox arcade sequel, or prequel to Dead Rising 2, whatever you wanna call it.
Uh, it's neat.
I don't have much more to say about it, but, ehh, it's neat.
Izzy get over here.
All right.
It all ends here.
One way, or the other.
Oh, I hate controller aiming.
Who said this was the last boss?
Hate controller aiming so much.
My controller is like, like those nightmares where you're trying to run, but you're just, like, stuck in quicksand.
And, here we go.
See how long this spitfire holds up.
I know I'm cheesing it.
I don't care.
I'm almost there.
Almost there!
I spit him to death!
Yes!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Sorry for your ears.
Cover your ears.
Whoo!
Fuck yeah!
I fucking spit the last boss of Dead Rising to death.
Wrecked.
Fuck yeah.
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Fucking perfect Dead Rising run.
Fucking perfect.
Everyone saved.
Every fucking side quest accomplished.
The best ending.
No death.
Fuck yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
KrinkleCrunch, thank you for subscribing. I really appreciate it.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
All right.
I'm gonna sit through the credits, because I wanna see the little end scene with all my stats.
But I'm in a good mood about that.
That was fucking great.
Fucking great.
Thank you, everybody, for coming out to watch me spit a man to death.
Um, I hope you enjoyed it.
I hope you enjoyed the game, because I wasn't talking that much for a large part of the stream, because I really wanted to pull this off, and I did it, and I feel great about that.
Fucking great.
Fucking awesome.
Fuck yeah.
All right.
Yes.
Yes.
And let alone no death, I've never even had, I've never even had a save everybody run.
I've always had either the coward or someone else on day two.
Fucking awesome.
Fucking awesome.
If you stuck around for eleven hours, thank you, thank you very much, uh, is it Gagao?
I, I, I hope you got something out of it.
Yes.
Yes.
I am happy.
I'm in a good mood.
This is worth it.
I'm about to lose my voice.
Gonna lose my fucking voice.
I don't care.
I'm gonna, one more time.
Cover your ears.
All right.
It's a warning.
Cover your ears.
Whoo-hoo!
Yeeeeha!
Whoo.
I am tired.
But also wired.
I don't know what I am.
I'm giddy.
I think I'm giddy.
That is great.
Fucking great.
God, they gotta release this on PC.
Cuz this Xbox, fuck this Xbox.
SharkyKrunk, thank you for subscribing. I really appreciate it.
We really appreciate it.
But Jack's not here.
So right now, it's I'm appreciating it.
But I'm sure Jack would if he were here, so I feel safe saying we really appreciate it.
We really do.
Whoo.
And look.
Achievement unlocked: Saint.
I did pull off Saint, because when you leave at the end of, uh, overtime mode, uh, Frank and Isabela count.
Yes, SpookyDooky.
Literally a perfect Dead Rising run.
No death.
Live.
One sitting.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck yeah.
Hooo.
All right.
I'm gonna wait till the final stats come up, and then I'm gonna end this stream.
But once again, thank you all for showing up.
I appreciate it.
I really do.
I'm glad, I'm glad you wanted to see this.
It's great.
Everything, everything is great right now.
Fucking everything is great.
Everything.
Literally everything.
Oh, it didn't show me the...okay, well, that's fine.
That's fine.
Good night, everybody.
It's been fun.
It's been a lot of fun.
We'll do it again sometime.
Um, I know at some point, I'll stream the entirety of Dead Rising 2.
I don't, I don't think that's gonna be a no-death run, though.
I, I may do a, maybe I'll do it as a perfect run, but I'll, uh, load saves after I die.
But, uh, thank you again for showing up.
It's been fun.
