Nope, not getting that chainsaw back from you.
Fuck it.
You know what, I'll get another one in the next area.
Fuck it.
This is not rocket science.
You jump up and climb the thing.
Somebody climb up there.
This is the least forgiveable thing, when they get caught up on that, on that shelf.
Fucker already wants food.
So what do I get with that?
Skill, what do I get, what do I get?
Roundhouse kick.
Lift Up.
All right.
All right.
I'll take Lift Up.
Fifteen minutes to kill before the next case starts.
I don't wanna drop that.
About time I started getting some stock upgrades, though.
Jesus Christ.
I have not seen The Vacation trailer, so I can't, I can't comment on it.
I know you're asking about it.
I don't, I don't know anymore.
I know nothing.
I know what's-his-face from The Office is going to be in it.
That's, that's everything I know.
It's a good run so far.
I, I'd be fucking delighted, I'd be, I'd be ecstatic if I didn't lose Leia and, uh, Gordon, the coward.
So, I can't save this game without overwriting my, my fully-leveled save, and I'm, I'm kinda terrified that I'm gonna have some kind of game-ending glitch.
And we won't be able to restart from the glitch.
Living on the edge, is what I'm saying.
Let her die?
Why would I let her die?
I love that Frank was just, he was just gonna let this happen and take pictures of it.
That was hard.
Shit, it's out of my reach.
Fuck.
Why would you start...
Always hold hands.
That's the, that's the lesson here.
Holding hands will let you go through the zombie acopalypse untouched.
Shit.
Ooh, Attack Up, that's nice.
All right, that was a minor setback in time.
A little bit of orange juice.
Coast is clear enough.
I don't have my mighty chainsaw.
That could be a problem.
Could be.
I can always...
My brain, my brain is doing things.
Excuse me while my brain does things.
I got time, yeah, I'm gonna do that first.
Looking for a queen here.
Not for that.
What are you gonna do, you know.
And now I'm seeing things.
None of you guys have got a queen?
I can't lose that weapon.
Not for the fight that's about to come.
Hamburgers smell me?
Fuck.
All right.
Take his shotgun.
No, you just wanna hold hands.Fuck you.
Take that shotgun.
Maybe a chainsaw.
It would've saved me a shitload of time.
I think I got enough to spare.
That's more like it.
You two just stand there and shoot at zombies.
I'm gonna take care of this business.
All right.
Nick killed her?
That's great!
Unexpected, but great.
My brother, Nick.
All right.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to hurt you.
Oh, my throw got upgraded.
Oh.
That's the last thing I needed.
Uh, we'll go down this way.
The pathfinding is not the best.
What are you guys waiting for?
Everyone get down off the stairs.
All right.
Now you're off the stairs.
Now you follow me to the bathroom.
All right.
Nick, you can, you can use that shotgun anytime you want.
Help yourself.
What's going on?
What's going on?
You guys, you know, go to the bathroom.
Sally.
Sally.
In the bathroom.
It's not creepy.
Just follow me into the woman's room.
Oh, shit.
I think he would've gassed me.
That would've been bad.
Where's the fucking bee?
Nick, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's all run to the door.
Run to the door.
Run to the door.
Janet, I also appreciate your enthusiasm, but not the time.
Why are you...oh, I must've mispointed.
I gotta be close enough.
Nick is the man!
What's going on?
What's going on?
Do I have to kill every zombie here before you'll move on?
Appreciate the enthusiasm, but we're on the clock.
We're on the clock.
Now you can start shooting again.
What are you waiting for me for?
Get up, get up there.
Climb, climb.
Why is this the hardest thing you've ever had to do?
Why?
I've got t-, time, time, time.
All right.
I need to get at that door.
Oh, fuck!
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.
This is about to get serious.
I'm gonna do this first.
I don't know if I should.
I should probably do girl-hunting first.
Shit.
Shit.
No, I'm not.
Main story comes first.
Main story comes first.
Oh, god.
Or should it?
No.
No, I'll do this first.
This is dumb.
This is dumb.
I wish I had more quickstep, but by the time I make more quickstep, it won't, I won't, it won't save me the time I want it to save me.
I wish I had quickstep.
Fuck off.
You little motherfucker!
Die!
All right.
Ain't time for fucking around.
Fuck off, Otis!
What are you doing?
Where are you, woman?
That was weird.
Hurry the fuck up, Floyd.
Hurry the fuck up.
On the clock.
Dear Lord, am I leveling up, though.
Always hold hands.
Everyone's gonna die while I'm holding hands because you couldn't run.
You pushed me, too, but...
Floyd.
Oh, boy, this game.
This game.
Yeah, you do.
That's why you better climb up here fast for me.
Come on.
Rachel.
Rachel.
Climb the stoop.
If I miss out on the major case file because you couldn't climb up on a stoop, I'm going to come back to the safe house and murder you.
Do you understand me?
Do you, do you understand me?
I can't remember, I can't forget to feed Ronald, because Ronald's a fucking fatass.
And if I don't feed Ronald, he's gonna have a mutiny, and I'm gonna lose half these survivors.
So we're gonna feed fucking Ronald.
Just give him the chips so we can go.
Give him the chips.
Give him the chips!
Get some orange juice going.
Hope my chainsaw lasts long enough to defeat Isabella.
I was gonna say kill, but I wish I wouldn't kill her.
I hope not.
I like Isabela.
Not played Dead Rising 3.
It's $60, and everyone says it's bad.
All right.
To the boss fight.
We're gonna have time.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Should I go to the chainsaw?
I should grab a chainsaw.
I would be, I would be foolish not to.
Because I have the time.
All right.
Feel so cheap using this chainsaw.
They haven't given me much choice...fucking A.
All right, all right.
Oh, boy.
I hate this fight.
Stop, and let me chainsaw you to death.
Yes!
So, what am I, about halfway done here?
Dear Lord.
Little bit of time to kill.
Little bit of time to kill.
Oh, whoops.
Ooh, I know where that came out.
The stream can't be that good, I'm hardly saying anything.
I make mixed drinks.
All right, now if you want to know the next most likely place this run is gonna bite it, um...if we're considering, if we're considering the run ending when the, like, if I fail the main story, and not just die, possibly in the tunnels.
It's been a while since I've been through those tunnels, and I don't remember the layout near as well as I used to.
So, uh, probability of dying there is, or at least failing the main mission there, the main story, is, uh, decent.
So now I'm worried about the tunnels.
Oh, I lost my bike.
But in, in, what a fashion, though.
What is the queen item?
That's a, that's a bee.
That's a, it's actually, the, the zombies in this game are the product of a parasitic wasp.
So, kill the, kill the bee that's in a jar, and all the nearby zombies collapse.
Those little green things floating around?
Those are zombie larvae.
Zombie bee larvae.
The zombies in this game are zom-bees.
How many more boss fights are there?
I'm not sure how many boss fights there are, numerically.
I'm gonna say I'm about halfway through the game?
You can go to bed.
I'm not forcing anybody to stay.
It is gonna be a long stream.
Oh, I know what I need to do.
Almost get some ammo.
Get out of the way.
Otis, I know.
I should've brought Otis.
I'm gonna get a shotgun before I forget.
Why do the guns in this game suck?
Uh, because it's a melee-focused game.
That's why the guns in this game suck.
Then why have them?
Uh, cuz some people might enjoy them.
They're, they're also not bad to give to survivors.
Survivors are pretty good to have a shotgun on their hands.
Oh, he has his own shotgun.
I didn't need to grab mine.
Oh, well.
Oh, Kindell, you're already there.
Kendall, you're great.
You're great except for when you try to have a mutiny later.
But, we'll deal with that then.
Right now, I need a shotgun, and you have one.
Kindell.
Counting on ya, buddy.
Counting on ya.
You keep shooting, Kindell.
You're the man.
I don't think the convicts were gone.
I think I was just lucky enough that they didn't spawn near me out there.
Your man, Kindell.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Do I have any zombie juice?
Oh, I do.
Can I get myself through the door?
Yes, I think you are.
All right.
Essentially in the clear.
I like that, uh, Kindell is wearing a tux.
He was, he's having a fancy zombie apocaplyse.
To him, this is an excuse to dress up.
All right, I got, uh, time to kill for a change.
Ooh, my attack went up.
That's good.
What are my skills looking like right now?
Not bad, not bad.
Item stock's looking good.
Knee Drop.
Ooh, we got the Suplex.
Hammer Throw.
What level am I at?
I'm doing good with leveling.
34, all right.
Whiif.
Ah, yeah.
Attack feels good.
Nice.
Nice.
This is fun.
Oh, all right.
I can get, I can get Floyd his wine.
I got time to kill
That seems like a fine thing to do right now.
Yes, I, I do know Dead Rising.
Uh, I'm just, I'm terrified about tunnels now because I no longer remember the most efficient route through them, and, uh, that section of the game is going to give me a heart attack.
Goodbye, baseball bat.
I'm a bare hand it.
So, you know what...
I've got time.I've got time.
Oh, yeah.
This is going down.
Furlay.
Rich, yep, there we go.
Furlay!
What was that, what was that.
You know, it's day three.
I don't think the convicts spawn again.
I think that's the last of them because it's after midnight, day three.
So they're, they're gone.
Lost my way.
I wanna go that way.
This is, this is a gigantic mall, but the park is, like, twice as big as the mall is.
This doesn't make any sense.
Oh, shit, I lost the chainsaw.
Get outta my way.
Otis, this is not the damn time.
Yeah, I should've grabbed another chainsaw.
I didn't think I was that low on, uh, health.
I'm kinda shocked, uh, it broke.
But...
We'll be fine.
Yeah, those three magazines aren't doing me a lot of good.
I, I do not have the Mega Buster, or the Mega Sword, if that was your question.
If I'm slurring, it's because I'm undergoing Dead Rising fatigue.
I think, first rule of zombie apocalypse is, uh, don't, don't turn your back on the guy who was just turning into a zombie.
Maybe that was a bad idea, Frank.
Oh, I'm not quitting.
I'm not that tired.
We're doing this shit.
It's going down.
Uh, Mopar, you're, you're wrong, I actually do have, uh, Dead Rising: Off the Record on Steam.
I got both Dead Rising: Off the Record, and, uh, another one, Dead Rising 2.
What if this game never ends, Rich?
If this game never ends, that means I've successfully completed my no-death run.
Where's the timer?
This game's gonna end.
And, no save.
Oh, boy.
No safety nets.
No safety nets.
All right.
Time to take care of some more business.
Problem is I have a lack of chainsaws, and a boss battle to get to.
Do I take time to get the chainsaw?
I think I have to.
Yeah, it's not gonna take me that far out of my way.
I feel, I really do feel so cheap using those, those small chainsaws, but it is a no-death run from level one.
I think I've earned it.
Fuck.
Oh, wait, I don't wanna drop that now.
Travel first, then drop.
Eh, fuck it.
All right, I've never used the, um, mini gun in a boss battle before, so this should be fun.
Yeah, I know, I know my Dead Rising 1, but those tunnels are terrifying me. 
I no longer remember the most efficient route through there.
And the time, the time constraints of that section of the game, oh, that's gonna be a fucking nightmare.
All right, that was a little bit effective.
All right.
Don't need that.
I definitely want that board.
Brainwashing tips.
Oh, shit.
Forgot about that.
Where are you going?
Get away from them.
It's all right, I brought food.
Get off my back.
Get away.
All right, we need to arm you guys.
I almost forgot my, uh, big gun.
Oh, I f-, forgot I can't kick with this.
Forgot I can't kick.
Are we missing somebody?
I'll go back to the theater, make sure everyone's rescued.
Who is missing?
Nobody left behind in here.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Glad I did a head count.
Come on, get your ass in gear.
You guys are armed.
Why are you having problems?
Ray.
Ray.
Come on now.
Really?
Really, Ray?
Almost out of minigun.
Be careful there, BEth.
Nathan.
Oh, okay, back.
Everybody bettet be right behind me.
I know, I know Beth is nearly gone.
First things first, first things first.
We're almost there.
Beth, Beth, stay, stay, stay safe.
All right.
Oh, Jesus H.
Did I forget to get Frank his wine?
Oh, goddammit.
That's fine.
Oh, I've got time to kill.
Again.
But I did fuck up a wine side-quest.
At least these fucking cultists are gone.
This door, all right.
Really?
Where'd he go, where'd he go?
Do I waste a quickstep?
I think I should.
I don't want to.
I'm gonna need it.
I know I'm gonna need it later.
I'm not gonna do it now.
One more fucking hit.
Fuck you, Paul.
Fuck...
There!
I gotta work faster.
All right.
If I'm right, there should be another case over here.
But I didn't get the call fixed.
I doubt it's available.
Nope.
What are you stuck on?
I like the tight tight limits, the tight time limits, I like that it's not easy to save all the survivors.
But they should be able to find their way out of a damn store.
Oh, no, don't, come on, I didn't mean to hit that button.
You guys stay where you were.
Gil, I'm gonna save Paul first.
Just don't kill anybody with that.
All right.
You, you head over there, Gil.
I'm gonna...
Oh, good.
Everything's syncing up here.
I won't be able to carry it.
Fuck it.
Gil, where are you?
I love this game.
Oh, goddammit, Paul.
I gave you a knife.
Oh, no, no.
I was trying to carry Gil.
Come on, Leroy.
Fucking drunk.
Come on, Debbie Downer.
Oh, give me my sword back dammit.
Stop taking my sword.
Fuck it.
While I'm here...
Don't wanna neglect the necessities of life in the zombie age.
Hurry up, I gotta collect Gil.
Get to the choppa!
Oh, shit.
You're fine.
Let's level up.
Oh, I didn't mean to do that there.
Fuck it.
Fuck it, it's fine.
When I level up, I'll get my health back.
It'll be fine.
I should level up here.
Somer-, Somersault Kick?
That's fine, that's fine.
I want the, the Gut Puncher.
Let's see if I can save old what's-her-face, or has she not spawned yet?
Yep.
All right.
Take my hand, Susan.
Ugh, shit.
Come on, old lady.
You know what, she is one of my favorite survivors, Susan here.
Here we are, day, day three in the mall of the zombie apocalypse.
The really, before Frank West shows up at the mall, the zombie apocalypse has already been going on for a few day, few days.
So here, look at this little, this little old lady managed to make it out on her own for, like, five days of nightmare zombie hell.
She's a tough old broad.
I love her.
I always gotta go out of my way to save Susan.
Come on, Susan.
I got, I got cases to solve.
I've got a sinister zombie plot to stop.
And I'm, I'm taking time out to escort you because, because you're wonderful.
You're a wonderful little old grandma who's tough, but I got places to go, people to see, zombies to slice up, same people to kill...
All right.
I might be able to do it.
I'm concerned about kind of sort of getting lost in the tunnels, and not being remembering the most efficient way through.
I'm worried about losing a lot of time.
Can't save.
What skill did I get?
Ooh, Face Crusher, Karate Chop.
All right, all right.
I just want the Gut Ripper.
I'll be happy when I get the Gut Ripper.
Do I have my face cut?
I didn't even notice.
Come on, Otis.
Just knock 'em back.
Goddamn you, Otis!
Oh, I got turned around, turned around.
Not good, not good.
Shit.
Shit.
Forgot all about our friend, Kent.
Fucking Kent.
Uh, yeah, we're doing the Kent thing.
I've come too far to skip Kent.
All right.
All right.
I should.
Do I lose all my items with the, the Kent thing?
I don't recall.
I'll find out.
Oh, nice.
Zombie free.
Tad.
That was very rude.
Now I remember why day three would drive me nuts.
It's all coming back to me.
All coming back to me.
This is why I needed to be good with the efficient routes, because, I, yeah, all this shit that crops up.
CD store, not there.
Okay.
Wrong store, wrong store.
Oh, I don't want to give you that.
Oh, shit.
All right.
Cuz I'm never gonna get it back from you.
So I'll need that.
I love thords.
Oh, Tad.
Oh, whatever.
Let's just get in the warehouse, come on.
Come on, come on, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, and there we go!
Don't, uh, don't forget to talk to Kindell.
Gotta talk to Kindell.
Can't forget to talk to Kindell.
This game is great.
We still have hours of game, but right here, some of the stuff that, uh, I think is the hardest is, is, is, is what we're kind of in the thick of.
This, this bomb time thing, still saving these people, cuz I'm a nut who has to save everybody.
Where's Kindell?
Where's that fucker, Kindell?
Who are all these fucking people?
Kindell's not in here.
There we go.
Kindell...
Look at this, we got a small society going on up here.
Oh, my god.
All right.
All right.
Now, now we're gonna take care of those bombs.
And this is why I was worried about playing.
Cuz I know I wanted to save those people, because I always save the fucking people, and I wasn't gonna have the full amount of time possible to do this mission.
Oh, boy.
Get off of me, you fucker.
Is that the Kurlan naiskos?
Thank god I killed those Jeep fuckers.
Oh, boy.
I think there's one up here, right?
I think so.
I hope so.
Get on that bike, get on that bike, get on that bike.
Next one is...I don't remember where they all are.
Get off the bike, Frank.
Did he blow up my bike?
He blew up my bike.
This is bad.This is bad.
But, secret weapon.This is ridiculous, but it works.
I can deal with this.
I assume the arrow is the direction I'm headed.
I hope it is.
Oh, man.
I'm as far away as I could be.
Eh, not really.
Horseshoeing, right? 
Right.
All right.
Holy shit.
2 A.M., huh?
All right.
All right.
I know there's three more people I can save.
I think they're doomed.
They might be doomed.
Right, left, right.
PizzaTrain11, that's a very good question.
Where is it, where is it, where is it?
There it is.
Left, right, left.
All right.
All right, we're going for it.
Fuck it.
All right.
That chainsaw's gotta last.
I don't think I have enough time to go back for another one.
Did he just call her a son of a bitch?
Time is running out.
You guys make up your mind.
Thank you.
You guys have assault weapons.
Could you shoot the zombies?
Oh, I got my Gut Ripper, finally.
All right.
Oh, shit.
We're down one?
Where's he at?
He's stuck on a door, isn't he?
I know it.
Tactical decision to let these people die.
He's gonna die, and I don't care.
I am...
If it gets too close, I'm fucking running on you guys.
It might be too late now.
They're gonna die, and I don't care.
Point of no return.
Tactical decision: they're dead. 
They're not.
I'm not fucking this whole run up because of that.
I think I accidentally killed her.
Oh, well.
If you guys can't keep up, I don't care.
Uh, I'm not gonna make it, third day.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
They're dead.
It's been decided.
It's been decided.
I feel bad, but this run's been too amazing to let die.
Fuck.
Come on, Izzy.
Oh, I gotta talk to you?
All right, I guess that makes sense.
Oh, is she waiting for him to die?
Oh, motherfucker.
Brett is not dying fast enough.
Oh, fuck!
You know what, fuck it.
By the time I get back, he'll be dead.
And then can take...aw, son of a bitch.
Oh, god.
Uh-oh.
You better not be froze.
You better not be frozen.
This is bad.
This is bad.
This is bad.
I, I couldn't save without overwriting my, my game.
Because I wanted to start from level one, saving was not an option.
Come on.Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
It's, I've, I've come too far.
Please don't do this to me, you fucking piece of shit.
You fucking piece of crap.
Ugh...
Well, this sucks.
This sucks.
RollWoll, Rich reads Stardust.
And, Priv-, WhitePrivilegeMexican, thank you for subscribing.
We really appreciate it.
Wow.
This sucks.
This really sucks.
I mean, that was good.
That was starting from level one.
I had a clear path to total fucking victory.
Total fucking victory.
So I lost five survivors.
I lost Leia.
I lost Gordon.
Then I lost the three gun nuts.
Gun nuts, it was on them.
Fucking idiots.
Ugh...
It was, it was, it was, it was in the palm of my hand.
The palm of my goddamn hand.
Fuck you.
All right, I'm gonna take a potty break, and maybe, maybe this thing will just unfreeze itself.
I don't know.
I'll be back.
It's done.
I did try to eject the disc.
I don't know how to react to that.
I really, really wanted to pull it off tonight.
Really wanted to pull it off.
Thank you, everybody, for showing up.
I, I hope you had a good time watching me nearly no-death run Dead Rising.
I can't even say I died.
This did not end because of a death.
This ended because of a goddamn hardware failure.
All right, everybody.
Thank you, thank you for showing up.
I'm gonna take off now.
I've got stuff to do tomorrow, and, uh, I'm gonna try again.
Obviously, not, not tonight.
And I don't know exactly when it's gonna be.
I's just, when I'm in the mood, I'm gonna set up another fucking secret stream, and we'll, we'll see what happens.
We'll see what happens.
All right.
Good night.
