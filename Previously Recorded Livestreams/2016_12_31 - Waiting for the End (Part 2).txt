Oh uh-oh we've got some kind of Star
Wars versus Star Trek war going here
Star Trek wins can't we just have a
casual interest in both we can we can't
you it's entirely possible I like Star
Wars well enough but I love Star Trek I
love Star Trek more than I love stars
yeah I like Star Trek better than Star
Wars but you know Star Wars has given me
some pleasure yeah Empire Strikes Back
is possibly the best movie ever made I
want to see what games Karen like stream
you have anybody got a better idea
rich no no it's fun casual fans need to
die I'll get right on that Tiberius yak
yak do not spoil the game best to walk
into it blind hmm
planet coaster I do love me some space
on planet coaster but it wasn't playing
very well on the computer here we were
having technical difficulties and we
tried to play there it didn't like
streaming play otherwise when you
weren't streaming but with with
streaming it freaked out that's true we
all are working on dying at all times
the heat death of the universe the
shortening of our telomeres the
digestion of my popcorn it wills if you
don't like Star Trek you don't like Star
Trek no problem planet coasters this
isn't it actually parka tech since we
tried to play it I have not I keep
forgetting to play it and actually right
now we still we're still working on it
we got to get our butts in gear right
now I do not have a regular working
Windows computer you've got the parts
for it we're painting the case you did I
can't get her interested in coming here
to paint yeah I want the flowers the way
she wants them eventually I'm just gonna
do it on my own that could work that's
what's gonna happen anyway so like he's
got a computer and I've got a computer
like but I don't have a computer at home
so yeah I haven't really played parka
tech yet and I back off the mic please
an inch or so I'm clipping what's
clipping
I'm an idiot I don't know here is that
better this clipping like when you hear
people's like peas and stuff that's
popping your piece do I do it probably I
do that all the time
we've bought special equipment to try
and fix my audio problems and I've
bested them all
please consume more popcorn popcorn is
good this is the kind where you just
open up the bag and it promises not to
have the camera being too much
horribleness into the camera or no
camera now you turn the camera on but me
get up and use the restroom you get
something to drink sure clipping is when
it goes over the maxim audio can handle
and either get okay okay okay but it's
not doing it now I turned her off
because people were saying they couldn't
hear over there yeah I have a tendency
to speak quietly but I've had the camera
in my mouth practic or the back of my
mouth practically turn her back down
it's fine I think just getting the mic
out of my mouth probably doesn't you are
you ready for this er just give me two

victorious they sealed the monsters

Joey
you must be so confused someone ought to
teach you how things work around here
that's scary I guess little old me will
have to do ready here we go
see that hard that is your soul the very
culmination of your being your soul
starts off weak but can grow strong if
you gain a lot of LV but selfies stand
for I love of course yeah excuse me
you want some love don't you don't worry
I'll share some with you if a stranger
starts offering to share love with you
his love it out here love is shared
through so I want to know little white
friendliness pellets is that what he
calls him are you ready I'm not sure
move around get as many as you can you
idiot in this world it is kill or be
killed why would anyone pass up an
opportunity like this die
being saved by a goat what terrible
creature torturing such a poor innocent
youth do not be afraid my child
I am toriel caretaker of the ruins I
passed this place every day to see if
anyone has fallen down you are the first
human to come here in a long time come I
will guide you through the catacombs
this way
welcome to your new home innocent one
allow me to educate you in the operation
of the ruins the ruins are full of
puzzles ancient fusions between
diversions and door keys one must solve
them to move from room to room please
just yourself to the sight of them
to make progress here you will need to
trigger several switches do not worry I
have labeled the ones that you need to
flip splendid I am proud of you little
one
let us move to the next room give me
more time to read what she's saying as a
human living in the underground monsters
may attack you you will need to be
prepared for this situation however
worry not the process is simple when you
encounter a monster you will enter a
fight while you're in a fight strike up
a friendly conversation stall for time I
will practice talking to the dummy yo
you encountered the dummy when you do
fight
you gotta hit the button when it's in
like the center of that green thing the
dummy stands around absent-mindedly
ya u10 XP and zero gold ah the dummies
are not for fighting they are for
talking we do not want to hurt anybody
do we yes
come now I'm gonna tell you some
mother's game or shy I don't know if I
should do you want to go find school
things apparently I'm not supposed to
kill things it's up to you
it's hardly up to you froggit attacks
you rocket didn't understand what you
said but was flattered anyway
yeah it's not like herons do to hold
playthrough it's possible she will love
this and continue it at home it's
possible
she kind of babies you keep the
dangerous situation she's taking your
hand here you go
puzzles seem a little too dangerous for
now hold my hand that you're gonna read
this I'm just looking at the chair I
would like to walk to the end of the
room I would like you to walk to the end
of the room by yourself gee can I handle
that forgive me for this
disassemblers
greetings my child do not worry I did
not leave you I was merely behind this
pillar the whole time thank you for
trusting me hearth there was an
important reason for this exercise to
test your independence I must attend to
some business and you must stay alone
for a while please remain here
it's dangerous to explore by yourself I
have an idea I will give you a cellphone
if you have a need for anything just
call be good all right
hello this is Tori Elle you have not
left the room have you there were a few
puzzles ahead that I have yet to explain
it would be dangerous to try to solve
them yourself be good all right so I
just sit here forever I don't know have
you do you have to do you do you carry
no frog what's up
excuse me killing I have some advice if
you act a certain way or fight until you
almost defeat them they might not want
to battle you anymore
mantra does not want to fight you please
you some mercy human
playfully crinkling through the leaves
fills you with determination I think
that's how you safe store your makeup
if you haven't noticed everyone you
don't kill by the way you're not gaining
XP nope you take a piece of candy mm-hmm
so you stole someone's candy sure Oh God
you'll take another one
you take another piece you feel like
this guy can't go in there
can you get it off the floor I'll lick
it what I lick it off the floor guess
not why would you want to lick it off
huh no you save after knocking the candy
over I see
Chad's calling you a murderer
dodge that you move the heart around
you killed something that was harmless
nice so how did that feel do it do it
cinnamon or butterscotch sorry I missed
the first part of that oh I see thank
you very much
hello this is toriel you do not dislike
cinnamon do you I know what your
preference is but would you turn up your
nose if you found it on your plate right
Ryan I understand thank you for being
patient by the way let the hate flow
through you Karen hmm okay three out of
four great rocks recommend you push them
yes I have already played under talent
yeah
something in the wall say three out of
four rocks recommend you pushin it
sounds like a hint
oops yes yes yes okay what do you keep
cuz I'm trying to figure out what I can
push are you kidding
this what is that right where is there a
rock okay why are you pushing it down
look at the setup here oh that's a hole
that's
is she serious she's not a gamer Oh
embarrassed that's alright it's alright
wait
I didn't
guess I did now I did a lot
that's another hit
there a stream of thumb tomorrow I don't
know about a stream of thumb let's
talking about Jay I have no idea what
the fuck Jay is gonna do but uh I might
come here and stream them wrong you're a
normal stream in time why not Raven
Raven you gotta remember you you move
the heart around so you have to dodge
things
what dodge you ran right into the Frog I
thought I was supposed to move out of a
ring of heart you you bill you've done
your heart your hurt has to dodge the
white things
you didn't do one last year but Jaya in
the past has done new year streams those
it was in early New Year's Eve I don't
even remember do you see the pattern
okay you follow different places when
you go in different holes what does this
room look like just a hint it's not the
same room they're showing you the path
but
now eat some candy
did J say he's streaming if J streaming
I'm probably not going to stream
I mean someone sent a text
you're supposed to remember where the
leaves are on the bottom and then that
walk on there on the top
yep oh he said nothing just in the past
that was 12 to 12 okay
hasn't striven years I thought last year
was the only year J hasn't done it which
early last year end this
and he is not so I'll stream i'll i will
stream to i don't think it's gonna be an
all-day thing basically I don't know
what I'm gonna stream around I'm just
gonna wing it it might be earlier Karen
the path goes all the way down you can
see it
or worse dreams about he didn't say
anything he just he just showed movies
that's of all the way down why did you
go over why did you fall in that exact
same Oh what is wrong why did you do
that why it was like you see I'm
flabbergasted no and then all the way
down yeah
is there way you can watch the streams
from the past no there on our YouTube

graphics I'm not gonna make it true 3d
are they because that would suck kind of
nice and good is well yeah but I mean
it's it's a game the baby cat again okay
cuz game mechanics err it's gonna be
side-scrolling there's not a lot of
depth yes I know I mean it's full 3d
it's just a side scroller and a corridor
yeah it's gonna be the same the camera
isn't panning around it sir I'm getting
to disrupt I mean I fix the stream room
so people could see what we're doing my
summer car jalopy there we go
grab the controller I play this fun fun
platforming game you'd get bleep around
you do things with you're leaping and
you're jumping in-you your whip lash
hair and all that shit it's gonna be fun
fun fun I'm sure here's what's her face
with underwear hangin above her head she
like an elf or something
she's a genie that's the game is called
half-genie hero for crying out loud
these are basic things which is adorable
it's nice animation maybe you go down
that hole dunno something there's
something else I can do too
video was zoomed in oh I see that I see
that I'm fixing it carrying what a pause
don't I paused it because you want pasta
but you're gonna disappear it's fighting
me why is it fighting me
well that sounds cool gave me after
derail a train using realistic physics
okay here we go yeah nice job this looks
great
kind of interact with the fireflies
that's indeed yeah the other button is
doing there okay
no but I can crawl
just going on a random prep door she
finds huh that's fine
I get burned
it's that little stumble animation scary
I do anything damage just avoid him
well I know I've seen videos of this you
should have some kind of hair whip maybe
you just don't have it yet see you're
skipping all that fancy story stuff I
was reading it that's fine
the game just taught you something pay
attention well Karen is skipping through
things real fast I don't think anybody's
paying attention
so what did they say I don't know
because I was busy listening to you
why are you busy listening to me I don't
have anything interesting to say you
didn't save no well not why the hell
would I haven't done anything well you
got to read that story think again
something goes bad well good then I'll
pay more attention next time apparently
fairly I can do stuff with my hair now
so I guess this means no stream tomorrow
no I'll probably stream tomorrow up to
fuck it like I got better shit to do I'm
I'm angry at XCOM I'm so I need to take
out some aggression I'm probably gonna
play duel probably I'm very mad at Max
combat what am i press why I shake my
hips
why am i angry on XCOM as you know
because I've talked about it a lot on
stream the last few weeks is I've been
trying to do a no soldiers lost
run-through on
XCOM in the last few days the last few
days I have been having the most epic
XCOM run I have ever had in the fucking
5/6 however many years it's been I've
been playing the reboot
XCOM everything was going right uh the
steam vents were in just the convenient
places I was doing good research I was
getting good rewards
I was just sailing through the game like
fucking water and I got to the this is I
guess this is a spoiler I don't know
Devon play next time I know you're
probably not going to I got to the
there's this one mission very near the
end of the game the the overseer UFO and
no losses I got Titan armor ghost armor
I got all the fucking plasma weapons
they got my on what difficulty classic
classic that's my favorite difficulty it
feels right classic feels good and I'm
on the overseer ship and you know I'm
being smart I've got some I made sure I
brought through I got like three ghost
grenades I got my won't heavy who
carried double grenades he's got two
ghost grenades and then I got different
soldier had another ghost cream this was
like two backups case shit hit the fan I
was gonna go spray and everybody and my
troops were chasing down this this elite
mutant mutant mutan who's running away
and I'm chasing him down to kill him and
probably like you've said probably I
uncover a psycho pod secta pods are very
dangerous there my tanks Michael walking
like 80209 if he was confident that's
what a sector pot is and
and I'm like all right no I'm fine
that's that's a sector pod this is what
I brought my ghost grenades for so I I
run my heavy up
I wrap and fire the sector pod just to
start whittling itself down everybody
who could see him which wasn't everybody
started whittling his health down and
then I used my ghost grenades everybody
is cloaked I can't get hit and what
happens the sector pod walks past my
troops and fucking triggers my assaults
close combat perk which automatically
fires when something gets within four
squares takes a useless shot on the
second pod that wasn't gonna come
anywhere near to killing it and it
revealed him from ghost mode he was no
longer in stealth and he had a sector
pod that was literally standing right
next to him he got shot he got critted
the mutant the elite view time we were
chasing he now sees my exposed heavily
injured assault trooper he takes a shoot
out him another crit I lost my favorite
fucking soldier in the game and my no
soldiers lost for one was killed it
probably would have been I was probably
within a few missions of beating the
game because the the last mission is
fucking cake as a fucking cakewalk and I
am so pissed at XCOM right now I am
never taking that close combat perk
again never
like the dinosaur
like Jesus I'd rather listen to rich
ramble about trek it doesn't sound like
you like any of the things I'd talk
about why do you watch but I mean I was
I was like literally three missions away
maybe four from beating the game and
accomplishing something I've spent the
last two months chipping away at this is
when I hear him screaming obscenities in
the night not this time
this time I was just defeated I was just
utterly defeated I was dead silent that
wouldn't have happened if it was a
support just saying I also wouldn't have
gotten that far from her support that
that troop had like over a hundred
fucking kills
oh yeah I was I was just sitting there
dead silent after it happened I saved
and quit deleted the file and sat there
I just sat there
support wouldn't have brought them back
to life sports can't bring back the dead
it only matters if they're critically
injured he was dead goddamn it just
saves come no one would know well for
one I would know and it's my own
personal challenge so same kiss coming
would completely defeat the point and
another thing as I was playing Ironman
where I can't save scum that
classic ragequit it's not a ragequit my
whole point was to do a deathless run
the minute that soldier died it was just
over there was no point in not quitting
I've beaten the game before normally
dozens of times
Blitzwing says i don't understand this
kind of challenge by arbitrary rules and
there's a one in a thousand random
chance of a rich perfect game roll the
dice enough eventually he'll win with a
lot of wasted time here's the thing
though
it's not just rolling the dice it's it's
using superior technics which I guess
the problem was taking to the
close-combat perk but that was a
tactical failure on my part not just
random chance X comes about minimizing
the randomness
hey rich what percentage of XCOM do you
think comes down to our ng rng random
number generator oh shit Bobby you know
in a sense shit
it has since all of the triple shit but
I mean you can you can manipulate what
what what your percentages are what your
what your odds of failing are like if
you're if you just play shitty your odds
of losing somebody are probably
relatively high very high but if you use
good tactics and you're smart about what
you do you minimize that you bring the
essence 10% you know XCOM is about
manipulating the randomness and the
randomness is what makes it fun it's
what makes it it's what keeps it from
being just you do the same thing all the
time and you're guaranteed the wind
there's no there's no thrill in that I
kind of like the RNG and if the one
thing if you were completely at its
mercy but like I said there are things
you can do to stack the odds together do
they have the ads be more favourably
earth to go in your eyes to know when
your boo-boo got toasted yeah what
that's I got distracted by burned you
got burnt you like this this is fun it's
cute but it's not fun it's just cute
well I don't know yet I just started
okay
I'm sure we ever going to launch
pass-through Neil Breen's newest
legitimate feature film on best endorses
Gavin 1529 it's a matter of when not if
we're going to do it eventually
yeah
that's
I can't just jump on here
can I drop a tiny business it's not just
have to be pushed with my hair or
something
MC Lucas says would you say that XCOM 2
has more randomness what with weapon mod
effects at all and would you say that's
a good or bad thing I think it's a it's
a fine thing like I said X comes about
getting dealt the cards and then playing
them the smartest way possible I don't I
don't think orangey is absolutely a
horrible thing unless you're a speed
runner what did i do - Jack I don't know
what the hell is going on Jack he has
not been returning my mustache I wasn't
I got a I friendly after like a week
we got a Happy New Year's text for the
job he's doing a digital detox or
something good babe I've heard very
little from him since he's been on his
vacation
it's his yearly family reunion I don't
wasn't it I'm sure you've busy yeah he's
spending time with his relatives he's
got a lot of them I hear ya that is the
thing I needed to talk to him about and
he wasn't a rude wasn't rude
we suspect what he's full of family love
or sick of his relatives whichever
happens first then he'll be back
oh geez no bitch they just keep coming
out now shake your hips at the enemy
it's bugging me not knowing what it does
says Shiva x51 it's the same I don't
know I don't know if it will do anything
more than the fact that they seem to be
kind of froze to do too much maybe maybe
you get some kind of like hip powers
later you just don't have them now be my
guest
this is adorable
whoa oh let's see just oh you just swim
I guess you can't get up to the higher
ledge
some beautiful sprites some of the
backgrounds I'm less sold on you jump
there was it worth it it all up on the
up on the upper right oh you probably
can you swim over there or something
she can transform through that dance
button so you probably just don't have
things you can no no here I go turn
Linda yet this game doesn't appear to be
challenging at all is it it is the first
level well I seem to be making it
through it pretty well and this is me so
probably not oh ye of little faith in
yourself that's sad it's so sad
that's a lot of pirate dirts
Oh does it work
what didn't we're all jumping up and
down to keep it from falling or
something no jumping on the one at the
drippers background or the one yeah
yeah does it need to be challenging to
be fun
give me my heart don't tell my heart my
Achy Breaky Heart you hate that song why
are you singing that says it's my heart
but you hate that song they do I'm a
woman of many contradictions moment of
cocktails in ancient wherever they are
low-key be 85s is rich when you go back
to your ex con game that you play
through to the end
I have a l'interieur to the melon
program make me a psionic or a mech
trooper to get some use out of me
question mark let me make you Mack I do
that okay I can't make you a psionic

air that's not yeah I can't guarantee
that
and this is this is this is old-school
platforming right here
it's one minute to 2078 depends know
where you are I got a full hour yeah
we're going by us us us standard time we
realize if you're the Pacific in our
time zone it's different to basically
any times over the sonars but we're
going by ours I haven't seen me play
rocket League in a while rich are you
over it says it's out it's just been so
exci funny that it's just there's no
room for anything else no well a little
bit of doom I don't think you've noticed
but a little bit of doom not that I've
seen
this happened I guarantee you what's
happened oh I believe you have some hair
uh-huh well it sounded like I'm having
fun noise Oh Alan that's a bird that was
a whimper if I ever heard one
nope
Kenny double jump no okay
we have some hair does it go with the
beat of the music
you got it you got it go up here and
collect the family Jews have some hair
more'n three cents I finished doom the
other day I sort of felt like the game
should have ended with the Marine just
straight-up punching that robots head
off and walking off screen I fully agree
there was no reason for doom to do that
kind of sequel bad bullshit
the game was so fucking fun it didn't
kill the game for me but yeah it didn't
need to do that at all and I would be
first in line for the sequel if they did
so head Happy New Year everybody in the
wrong timezone
what book yeah do you wanna do you wanna
switch I'll talk to him
all right because I think Greenwich is
the master time zone yes T is just DST z
it better
oh now we're having time zone flights
CST is the best time zone because I see
DT is the best time zone we're currently
not in it
I much prefer daylight savings
you read this one right this is her you
read it again I think I did
Happy New Year oh yeah I threw up and
I'm barely drunk I hate drinking fuck
this you're already fuck you it's
January
nobody tips tonight that's fine it's an
off night oh yeah oh that's cute
a boatload of whatever they are and a
ship with a face all right
well China kind of has a mono timezone I
mean it's a huge huge section of land
and it's all on one timezone despite in
the solar sense being a good number of
hours from one end to the other and they
seem to get it done they said your inner
weeaboo finally came out I forget what a
weeaboo is that's a fan of anime yeah
this game is cute doesn't mean I ship on
a slug yeah yeah you doesn't mean I want
a snail it's got a snail in the back
awesome sorry no that's all right it's
interesting that you say it's one
Wisconsin accent because I'm not from
Wisconsin Northern Illinois like I know
it's such a huge difference but south
suburbs of Chicago
what am I supposed to do oh my climate I
think he's uh yeah he's like got a snail
shell on his back end in three eyes I
know you're talking about a time zone
for the whole planet but I'm just saying
that I if China could manage it over
like you know five hours or something
why not when people go into space I
guess you would have to even set it by
some arbitrary time zone no I don't
Chicago Chicago nobody I know in Chicago
go she can go or sausage sausage Chicago
have I've ever been to the west coast
I have not it's like a very specific
accent probably spoken in a very small
area by a very few number of people yeah
the the dub bears thing is is more
uncommon that the dubbers thing was was
kind of a South Side of Chicago accent -
the thing is for like 30 years now the
south side of Chicago has been in black
people and Mexican people who don't talk
like that
yeah
that was a specific time in a specific
place Chicago accent that doesn't really
it's dispersed there are people who do
that da da da bears thing but they're
kind of dispersed now
wellnot England accents send to have the
the non-rhotic ours you park your car
and then Chicagoans are very erotic ours
and when I think of like West Coast I
think of like Kurt Cobain's accent yeah
Fargo Fargo is like Minnesota North
Dakota someplace north and west but not
like Seattle northern West North and
middle say I've done Avenue like that
why the hell are we disturbing I don't
know didn't have any other plans
we're not real really party animals
arrested faced Kurt Cobain debut 2016
that was 1994 he's been gone in a while
now I think I though other people say
aughh didn't how do you say oh gee D en
oh yeah
Ogden Avenue you tell everybody shows it
I thought that you yooper was like the
Upper Peninsula people like Michigan
people outside of Chicago don't say
Ogden that way well yeah of course
everyone has an accent where everyone
thinks they don't and everyone else does
we got a tip from Dan and stuff he
tipped us a lucky number and a smile
right back at you
Ogden Ville Brockway and north
haverbrook don't know where that is by
starting with like half heart of health
and get excellent sir there's all
different accents and there's like they
change over time which supposedly
increasingly a lot of people are saying
caught and cut the same way dawn and
Dawn the same way I'm starting when I
have heard of health cuz Karen did a bad
job of getting am I your sister I hope
not that would be like creepy really
weird
people don't believe that I can have a
love life Cina me said so the central
Illinois almost has like a southern
accent because like when I first started
going on AOL I had a friend that I met
online and I met him and his family
they had a work trip up at our Navy Pier
they met him up there southern Illinois
is practically the deep south well no
but we talk about central Illinois he
was he was they were from mom rant tool
which is up by Champaign remember they
were like and they're like can school me
everything was there accident was
definitely different I think you missed
a tip did I miss a tip oh I did
apologies hi rich hi Karen didn't want
this night to go tipless here's a little
bit for all the entertainment keep
playing games like games you like also
lol Happy New Year and here's another
one from
gobbledy that was from qi shots and this
is from gobbledy cooks happy new year
what's a pirate's favorite letter the
sea har-har-har-har I think it would be
our that's there's multiple jokes this
sure art or the they do different
versions of that I'm sure I've heard
that our see yeah
anything south of proper Chicago sounds
southern I don't know anything I think
anything south of Kankakee sound
southern yeah although some people in
Joliet who grew out there have have
something different going on it's not
exactly southern but it's different I
think don't you know don't know about
Joliet or lump it in with Chicago
something well if I mean the fair number
of Julia residents are transplants from
Chicago or transplants from Chicago
suburbs they're all kind of mixed
together
no Rantoul isn't practically Indiana at
least not the one I know of rental this
Rantoul is I mean X and wisedom you know
parts of some parts of Indiana but brad
tool is just a little bit north of but
about 20 miles north Champaign Champaign
Urbana you know and I they said nice
snail killing thank you it's cute it's a
cute game that's see if you can leave
the stage and go get more health good
point now
I seen the alien covenant trailer uh
here's this is telling I've seen it and
I can't remember a damn thing that
happened in the trailer it has it
completely left my brain this came up
last stream and I'd watched the trailer
that morning and I couldn't remember
anything that happened in the damn
trailer so yeah man Tino I mean it's
like some of those suburbs it's like
people who grow up in them have a little
bit of a in the far southwest suburbs
which didn't really use to be suburbs
even they just kind of turned into
suburbs of Chicago they do have a little
bit of a difference something I think
something cute is gonna happen but a lot
of people are transplants something cute
it's terminal monkey and she can climb
oh this is so cute now she's human again
well I think the monkey tutorial that's
such a cute monkey
if yours Peoria is far enough down that
that it sounds different than the
Chicago suburbs accent but it's subtle
like if you're from like Boston I don't
know if you would hear it and I'd like
to save the game oh sure I guess yes
definitely excellent sir need
I really like West Virginian accents and
Pittsburgh accents are fun who can get
rid of these pirates for good we're not
talking about you mokey just present the
savage negligible fish the early issues
of the savage dragon counter book took
place in Chicago he was a Chicago cop
the savage dragon and somebody wasn't
Eric Larson himself but somebody wrote
like a savage dragon miniseries and the
the artist for it was in the background
what there were mountains in the
background the glacier scoured the fuck
out of Chicago what is now Chicago and
good deal of its suburbs is on the
bottom of an ancient lake bed stood out
like a sore fucking film Chicago has no
mountains the cornfields Ted the corn or
the mountains Ted the mountains were
over Iowa the cornfields Ted the
cornfields Tyree had like airplane are
you fond of the movie Halloween the
classic horror film you know I haven't
seen it in 20 years at least you know
where it takes place have some game you
don't wear takes place Michigan or some
Villeroy okay Mike pointed this out
Hitchcock was flat I think it's a
problem next place like Chicago suburbs
somewhere Illinois that's fairly urban
Mike pointed this out we're doing the
commentary track for Halloween there's
there's just like a like a shot or two
with a school like an elementary school
it's an outdoor hallways yeah they they
have done that they would not see that
here there was there was one place where
they did it people said it was such a
bad idea
we're I forget and somebody was saying
it was such a bad idea yeah you don't do
outdoor hallways for schools in the
Midwest because it's too fucking crappy
out six months of the year
Haddonfield a little yep
but I think there was at least one
school where they did that it's just a
bad idea
marine kind of had that going hold all
these different buildings so you had to
stroll across campus in the middle of
freeze to death winter your high school
was built on a hill all outdoors
yikes well I mean the Midwest is mostly
flat unless some River recently did it
or a glacial post-glacial deluge scoured
the shit out of it and you know made a
river extra deep or or some glacial
glacier left garbage all over the place
like like glacial erratics and moraines
and drumlins and all that good shit
Kettle Moraine x' they want to know if
your microphone is on they say they can
barely hear you barely what no that
can't be true that can't be true I see
my thing going seem a line I see your
thing maybe they're just fucking with
you
testing testing 1 2 3 can you hear me I
jiggle the cord
they say you sound this person says you
sound fine at this point ok it's deluge
not deluge ok I don't think I've ever
heard anybody say it maybe I'm just
channeling my inner deluge I know I was
saying huge
oh I have been to Matheson State Park
it's beautiful the bluffs it's
absolutely gorgeous
it's Matheson or Matheson or whatever
state park and Illini State Park and
starve Rock State Park did you ever tell
them our story about Starved Rock State
Park
probably not rich and I went on a field
trip or just just so loud that his
breathing sounded like he was talking
whoa what anyway we we went on a field
trip with the local community college to
starve Rock and there was this special
guy I don't know if he was I don't know
what his deal was but he was on
medication supposedly and probably
shouldn't have been wouldn't should have
been unsupervised but I don't think the
people running this thing were made
sufficiently aware of that fact anyway
we found ourselves wandering around
trying to find him wandering around with
park rangers trying to find this guy and
then I was supposed to go babysit and
they didn't believe me why it was late
I'm like no really there's this this guy
and he ended up on the other side of the
dam supposedly and I don't even know how
you do that walk across yeah I didn't
know you could walk across the dam I
didn't know they'd let you like you make
somebody bottom off and I probably don't
let you I mean he wasn't all there he
was yeah he was specially enabled
something I don't know if he was you
know psychotic gonna walk across the
thing I don't know if he was I had or or
if he was developmentally delayed or all
these I know I really was special
he was somebody said something about
Medicaid heard he was a retard that's
what I was told he broke his back
climbing Bluffs yeah this probably not a
good idea
those are some tall Bluffs you know what
else has some really nice bluffs his
Garden of the Gods day park where I
almost got blown off a bluff I swear the
wind was intense and I stood up and I
started to lose my balance and I was
like oh shit I do not want to fall but
that's at the bottom of the state
yeah if you're ever near Utica Illinois
definitely check out star Rock Galena is
really pretty too that's out in the
northwestern corner of the state always
got a lot of nice state parks they're
not as showy is like you know Grand
Canyon or something but remember we went
to that one in the bottom of the state
and they had there was prickly pear
cactus growing atop of the bluffs that
I'm like seriously in Illinois but it's
shit soil shit soil and I guess they
liked it there
they watched Dirk Gently and they're
pretty sure one of the characters is
based on the mr. Plunkett
really they also say that they're
triggered because you said retard em hmm
and they're glad to see is playing
shantae because it's always been one of
their favorite names I hope you don't
mind that I don't know what the hell I'm
doing though especially cuz Karen played
the first part of the game before she
handed over the control I've no idea
what's going on can I go down that path
no I guess you got married in Galena
it's pretty though it's like unglaciated
Utica Utica Illinois that's where star
rock is it's on the Illinois State River
Illinois River monkey jumps on
I don't know about mermaid falls there
might be one something called that there
that said you just need to remove your
skeleton jokes they never get old
where's Jack say some Jack stuff Pokemon
Pokemon I like the pokemons pokemons
cool dooma dooma dooma dooma DUP in the
Pokemon I have a mild Pokemon story okay
for reasons I had to go buy some Star
Wars there's a garden of God metallic
Colorado this isn't that what this
wouldn't know when I go ahead are you
sure yeah you view of them big habit of
just interrupting me mid-sentence well
then for work I had to buy some smaller
stuff for work and for child I grab some
posters they had a Star Wars poster Ben
I grabbed some and when I get back here
I noticed that somebody had just thrown
apparently just thrown some Pokemon
posters over the Star Wars once fact
calf posters two of the four posters I
bought her Pokemon posters fascinating I
know the interruption kind of heightened
the anticipation for the story
originally would have been I bought some
posters into a book but no I had the
interruption and that'd be kind of thing
and well go guys I didn't reference
what's he gonna say this must be
important no no it's not
they said that you are the baseline jack
is the baseline that gives you've scale
yeah I'll agree with that
Dickson mounds navin American Museum in
Illinois check that out if I'm ever near
it
I'm soon that's in Dixon
passive-aggressive popcorn you know I've
driven by bong recreation and sniggered
at the name but I have never actually
been there
imaginal art potheads liked to hang out
there this because of the name yeah I
found out something interesting about
420 what about it it's Hitler's birthday
pop tea time is also Hitler's birthday I
guess he had to be born sometime they
want to know what Project Hornet is no
sense gobbledygook that's know nothing
might ever even come of it so don't
worry about it
sorry I guess you're Sol but thanks for
the tip if there's something basically
when there's something very concrete to
show for it you'll you hear more about
it but so you're asking if any of us
read why why do you ask
care do you hope do you want to know
about Karen Reed's religiously suppose I
read about religion lately I've been
reading about nuclear disasters so talk
about it talk about it what have you
been reading what is that book what is
it I just started it not too long ago
all right
was it cold what's a cold what's it
about where can we find it atomic
accidents it's got Amazon like
everything else it's just called atomic
accidents that's the whole name I think
so
all right good member of it is a
subtitle haven't looked at the cover but
lately but cool native bounds and bounds
in Ohio Zuko okay I have like cool
mounds how far down is Cahokia that's an
Illinois right where's that Missouri
Missouri so don't you say it bizarro
misery
good morning from the yellow and blue
people up north yellow and blue are no
aren't Canadians like red and white and
with maple leaves on them right next to
st. Louis okay
Oh favor got him staying loose again we
should stop the copia Brazil had a
pretty terrifying nuclear accident after
a chemotherapy machine like a radiation
machine like uh um like uh there was a
radiotherapy if this is the incident I'm
thinking about there was some kind of
like yeah one of those cat scan machine
radiotherapy and well the hospital was
shut down but the equipment was left
there okay some some jackass was just
breaking in the hospital messing around
and he ended up grabbing some amazing
glowing blue rocks from the cat scan
machine and he took them home and oh
yeah let me give them to my wife and
children and like oh look radium half
the family died of cancer half the
family or radiation whatever it was half
the family died hmm you saved me it took
me I mean he killed rape he was sorry
but it took a while I think they were
selling them too it was a big deal when
they had to track down the the fucking
radioactive material from the cat scan
machine if that's the incident on
thinking of
they say fuck you it's January and a
Mary knew aids not for another 34
minutes here and we said Richard karen
standard time counts
they died of karma the family didn't it
was the the Jackass husband who fucking
stole the radioactive material how do I
get that shit down there
oh the glow-in-the-dark watch faces yeah
those those have some sad stories behind
and the women who painted them no bueno
a lot of accidents are due to people
going to great lengths to ignored stable
all safety measures they are all the
family died the guy survived but died of
alcohol after many years who oh that's
the kicker if it killed everybody but
him yeah it was cesium okay cesium says
of him are you saying this is some Mead
mermaid's why this will mean stop being
mean because they have no vaginas okay
okay I can get that my legs are stuck
together I hate the world
he
your old record cleaner had polonium in
it why bottom half of a fish isn't
exactly a vagina I mean they just kind
of squirt out eggs most of them you know
external fertilization on both ends
would I rather reverse mermaid those are
in the monster party fish with legs
under eye areaa wanted to review I said
so I could just see that some kind of
Disney song with with one of the Ariel
tunes about how she wants to have a
vagina she didn't really want I wanna be
owner of us now what do you think she
wanted legs she did one leg she wanted a
vagina she wanted yeah exactly it's all
there
monkey is so cute
so amazingly cute yeah I say eggs and
legs it's not sure where I got that from
because I say pegs of eggs legs wasn't
then a woman's kind of pantyhose kind of
thing no but I mean either people tend
to say eggs and legs and I saying legs
plus it pegs eggs peg legs Ariel thought
it was better down where it's wetter
it's a whole new world
hol e you people are great sometimes you
really are yeah yeah was legs L ' EG GS
the whole family died of radiation
poisoning you had to be put in thick
graves to hide to contain the radiation
it's an order which is apparently where
does the West Coast thing there's a fair
number of people who say soda and stuff
around here but I grew up saying pop
rich you grew up singing pop people get
your snotty about it yeah what's the
sort of people who get weird about it
because I don't know who say people who
say pop are used to hearing people who
say soda and don't really care and
sometimes I might even say soda but
there's people who say soda people who
don't say pop just get all cement out of
shape about pop the same people who are
like yeah like the Packers I'm gonna be
a jackass about that for the next 20
minutes well it's like I noticed I
noticed when I worked at the Kroger
affiliated grocery store that that the
the West Coast people were all saying
trash and I'd always said garbage I
certainly knew what both meant same
thing basically yeah I've heard of that
everything is a coke and then you
specify what kind of coke do you want
7up huh pop is a child just pops just
pop it's got bubbles in it
I mean yeah it's an easy word to say but
lots of words they're easy to say dog is
easy to say I'm not sure this is a
children's game or not this is what it
being carried around by their hair are
they're getting they're getting their
made parts stuck on their bottom laughs
the fish are like attaching to them and
eating their vaginas
oh it's canine I'm sorry canid Oh
cow cur mongrel mutt yes some people do
say soda bub and I'm okay with that
it's an artificial mermaid Factory maybe
they said this shouldn't shouldn't eat
something with a face on it so they're
eating the other half of her
it does have some sexual imagery but I
think it's mostly it would mostly go
over kids heads yeah I think okay so
fishes eating is attaching to their
lower body okay fish is eating them okay
there's a fish stuck on them all right
they wouldn't think about it being
sexual that's kind of cute
what are they attached with or their
arms bound behind their heads I think so
they want to know if she goes supernova
when she dies sure why not
Oh froggy I mean uh excuse me monkey I
gotta figure out what to do I don't know
what to do
Oh even can't hidden grab those I didn't
know that alright riding around the
other side maybe maybe she can - there's
curious how do you turn into a monkey
that's what it dances
what else can she whoop screamin oh well
probably other things as you progress if
I had to guess she's gonna be able to
turn into a mermaid this said it's rated
teen despite having nearly nude women in
them oh whatever
well so does a package of that cells
Barbie dolls lots of things have nearly
nude women in them hey rich here's a
good question what movies rated G and PG
back in the day do you think would be
rated pg-13 and are today gremlins would
be an are today Indiana Jones Temple of
Doom would be an art today Robocop might
be an nc-17
airplane basically I think the movies
that started pg-13
would probably be are today because
pg-13 is lost off its my pg-13 is
there's no stupid pants a poltergeist is
a good choice
what does poltergeist Raider well at 13
I think maybe that before
pg-13 was the thing pg-13 wasn't a thing
until like 84 85 the Temple of Doom and
gremlins kind of led to the creation of
pg-13 unless I'm understanding this
completely wrong what was Empire Strikes
Back that's G I think she imagined or PG
probably PG he does get his hand cut off
yeah lots of people get killed by lasers
admittedly kind of bloodless it seems
weird that that would bother somebody to
murder no problem I saw those movies as
a kid and yesterday of course I also saw
Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1 & 2 repeatedly
what's my goal where are we going
didn't Beetlejuice have a couple fun to
start I don't know I don't think
Beetlejuice has any fucks in it it's got
a whorehouse but I don't think it has
any fucks it I think he grabs a woman's
boobs doesn't he yeah once again it's
not a fuck but what is it pg-13 you get
to say one swear one wonder you get one
fuck I think I think so oasis nice
fucking model supposedly Wendy's looking
at the houses yeah you're right
all right what are we doing what about
what is our goal you know how can
anybody make 13 without hearing the word
fuck about 8 million times okay all
right thank you
pulses poltergeist was our until the
filmmakers argued it down to PG it's you
know potentially scary somebody rips his
face off it's not it ends up being not
real but somebody rips his own face off
and pulled her geist have you ever
watched this movie not rated yet heard
of I don't haven't seen it yeah he
knocks the tree over and the noxes max's
honks his wanker that movie he's just
such a good dirty old man ghost huh
that was a kid I was upset he wasn't in
the movie more he knows the movies
because the movie was called Beetlejuice
but he's he's hardly in it what it's
about the two new guys know but it's
called Beetlejuice then when I was a kid
I still like the movie that used to
drive me nuts
like I wanted more Beetlejuice
twenty two minutes until Chicago shoots
guns into the into the air instead of
that people so yay I've never seen much
of that yeah
really depends on where you are people
have this idea that these Tigers Chicago
was just horrid all the time
car goes it's not Chicago is gangs but
it's it's it's not Hickey no I think
they mean like like getting people
shooting they do that for New Year's the
game people do that people definitely
shoot guns into the air but they do does
that gang thing is that a common gang
thing I don't think that it is
especially I don't know when the Cubs
won there were people shooting guns all
the time yet probably although all those
illegal sub fans yeah although the the
biggest Cub fan neighborhoods aren't
probably the biggest gang member
neighborhoods but doesn't mean the
people might not have guns the story of
the guy who played the dad was more
scary than Beetlejuice himself was the
actor do something scary oh that guy the
night Chicago died paper lace that's an
old song so here's my question exactly
Jenny Jenny Kerr of course then so my a
Sox fan here's my question is winning
the World Series the worst thing that
could have happened to the Cubs time
will tell is it the worst thing that
happened lovable losers the Goat curse
yep
their whole culture is based around
being losers what the fuck'd Cubs fans
do now I don't know my dad's just me
watching watching reruns of their games
but go well now they have to work on
their whole identity is just nothing
what's a dynasty once once let's you
know times gone by and the team is bad
again because you know that team stays
good forever no
yeah but they got but you know they
could potentially win more than one in a
row they've thrown away their legacy I'm
not kidding I think I think winning the
World Series in the long run might be
the worst thing that happened to the
Cubs enough in a hundred years they're
asking if you can knock the fish off the
woman with your hair whip nope nope nope
oh these guys suck there's also still
the Cleveland Indians who now have the
longest drought
that Cubs ticket prices win or lose have
always been pretty high although we did
manage to get three decent seats for 17
bucks a pop of StubHub but that was few
hours before game time on a Tuesday
afternoon they see it's nice weather
though that was a couple years back
oh there are definitely teams that have
never won a pennant yeah but they have
been around that long
like expansion team like 50 years sure
you want to know why snakes have boobs
in this game other snakes with boobs I
guess I'm looking at this way too much
let's just flat out snake more than it
wasn't like a snake woman an alligator
with a construction hat helmet they're
hard at that wasn't the ever mentioned
snake woman oh god damn it this is a
cute section I like this yeah this is a
section it reminds me the Amazon
warehouse one miles and miles and miles
of Rolly conveyor belt
Oh God stick large and the chances maybe
they are cobras oh yes oh yes this is
what do we got here totally adorbs as
the children say I might say I don't
know what she would say gobbledygook hey
guys I just had gallbladder surgery
yesterday have you had any operations
just curious your stream is helping me
with the pain thanks really the closest
I've ever had was I had an ingrown
toenail removed you had a kidney stone -
it didn't have to be operated
operational she doesn't enjoy it that
was just pain medicine that's what that
was and eventually it leaves the only
the only operation I've ever had
it was dental surgery I had I had an
extra tooth inside my jaw and they had
to let go inside and screw around with
that and then I also had four wisdom
teeth extracted I didn't have wisdom
teeth surgically cuz they were like yeah
buried us fuck
but I've never had you know abdominal
surgery it doesn't sound like much fun I
hope you heal soon and then there's a
also a message
let me see if I can whoopsies trying to
stream up her scroll up this time it's
lupus look at the Boston Red Sox they
won in 2004 breaking their 86 year
cursed and they had the same lovable
futility and their DNA as the Cubs did
the Red Sox are fine and so will the
Cubs be the Reds the Red Sox are always
going to have a ton of funding because
it's like them in the Yankees the Red
Sox East Coast people seem to care
the Red Sox lamented losing the Cubs
reveled in losing well the wisdom teeth
extraction I mean I'm sure your mileage
varies I think it's supposedly easier if
you haven't chewed on them yet but on
the other hand mine needed to be dug out
of completely out of the bone but the
answer is no it wasn't very painful I
was awake for it and I was just numb to
the high heavens with a whole bunch of
novocaine and afterwards it just feels
like a lot more less pain and more like
a lot of pressure in your jaw bone for a
couple days jack feels and you put ice
on it and take your medicine and try to
sleep as much as you can and it's not
that bad I know exactly how I feel so as
I was saying before I was so rudely
interrupted I was like like what your
Boston with your Red Sox I was like oh
the ball Bill Buckner the ball oh that
was horrible oh god that Bill Buckner
and we should have one comes maybe next
year it's the goat this different
culture look I guess I swerved it comes
reveled in it you didn't have any wisdom
teeth that makes you lucky
and yes supposedly humans are evolving
out of it having them but at this point
I think the evolutionary pressure you
know very few people die of their wisdom
teeth these days maybe in the third
world so we're probably thought oh my
god that's us should having them and our
great great grandchildren have them too
but if you don't have them it's probably
for the best
yeah Duke if you've got dental insurance
you know get them taken out and you'd
this person for the wisdom teeth and
nine other adult teeth yeah that sucks
too
I was born with with an extra tooth that
caused the log jam with one of my baby
teeth or Adele T there's something I
don't know I had besides the besides the
wisdom teeth thing I had a little log
jam going up in my jaw that they had to
surgically fixed and put braces on to
make room for shit to move down I
thought you're gonna sing for a second
no I don't have an extra chromium that I
know of
it was born with an extra chromosome I
mean you know don't know about any
mosaicism but I'm pretty sure I'm
genetically normal other than that well
you know Binding of Isaac that's Jack's
game now get your wisdom teeth out
sooner rather than later because they
have a tendency to your parents your
parents are rich and and and you've your
parents are doctors get the teeth taken
out sooner rather than later it's not
going to get easier it's not gonna get
cheaper the recovery is not gonna get
easier later on get it done now before
they start causing shit and my my advice
for her after you have your wisdom teeth
taken out as mashed potatoes
seriously ice cream is not satisfying
most liquid diet things are not
satisfying but overcooked macaroni and
cheese or potatoes they'll stick with
you you won't be hungry again two
minutes later and you don't need to chew
yeah the dentist kind of has to get you
in a headlock couple the hooks it's hard
physical work to get those teeth out
he's got to get a hold of your head so
we can get some leverage righteousness
yes some people do have big enough jaws
and sometimes it works out fine but most
people don't have enough room for all
their wisdom teeth to be a be our
protein shakes are a good idea too
mashed potatoes stick with you
yeah take the sedative yeah rich and a
dry socket you had a dry socket when you
had your tooth done right think so what
does that even mean ways they call the
dry socket it's infected right just what
it means right yeah it's it's one I
think it's when the blood clot comes out
before it's healed
you see you have health boots on the
pause screen
all right I don't I don't know if those
respond so I'm gonna destroy a couple of
locks before I use one
in our timezone we have 10 minutes the
rich and care and timezone is is central
CST
his central time represent nine minutes
oh she hasn't done that one before
I'm fucked well what well I need to go
the bathroom but I think I'm gonna wait
another nine minutes so it could be a
Happy New Year P oh my god
that's worthy of my father my dad tells
one of my buns horrible Derek's horribly
horrible chairs
that's that does not sound like fun
whatever does it's three years of braces
getting bone grafts and then upwards of
seven screws in his jaw or her jaw he or
she is it sounds like congenitally
missing some teeth a lot of teeth
idgaf you-you-you says I don't give a
fuck you or something says they were at
the red fair the same day as us oh
you're one of those people that we saw

Faire or the other time we went a few
weeks before that they're not gonna know
what trip of ours it was well I mean was
it the very last day of the Ren Faire or
was that because we went on the very
last day and then we also went there a
few weeks before that send a tip not
sure if it went through oh wait wait

the first time ever been there twice in
one year it was pretty sweet although
the second time there were a lot a lot a
lot of crowds it's made a little hard to
move I don't think was wisdom teeth can
make you look like the Elephant Man they
could possibly cause your other teeth to
shift a little bit become crowded but I
don't think you're ever gonna turn into
like a warthog or something oh this is
gonna take forever
I gotta find like a countdown timer let

enter her head in her glowing head ball
yeah man my dad had like a wisdom uh uh
a molar taken out when he was a kid and
his wisdom tooth just kind of popped
more or less in the right spot nobody
say that wisdom teeth can never be
useful but if the dentist says to take
him out that probably caused me a
problem if they hurt they're probably
causing you a problem
they say that you should quickly take
shelter in her enormous cleavage guru
11:59 and 12 seconds
