okay here's a situation parents went
away on a week's vacation
I have hotter leads to follow
apparently I do okay fine I'll go to
burgeroo's okay boom okay I got mucho
paperwork to finish it's gonna be crazy
yeah we'll come here see you at the
office we're going to have a major party
alright here we go alright Chad I will
try read envelope I like that what do
you roars look at back at envelope
okay okay all right good should have
gone to Murray's next what do you think
we should do next we go talk to Burberry
should we go to Marie's well we skipped
ahead right we know we know some shit
went down Murray's so it's like no
matter what when we go to Murray's it's
gonna be all turned over right so
fucking talk to burglary we're here
right now let's do art let's if I didn't
know that Murray was kidnapped it would
be like let's do that thing you do yeah
absolutely
well we did it with a clue in the
lipstick right but you know a lot of
Dame's use the lipstick making them ups
or making them up huh see paint give man
evidence and you tell John who Kobe is
what who's Kobe you turn in Kobe's
business card and you tell John who Kobe
is what are the business cards here
did we write this down no are you just
going back look at oh look at the
different card okay
that's it yeah that's yours no what's
your entire look at Colby's Colby's
business card Colby down that nervous
Colby's imports four oh seven five five
five three three two three okay great
great great it's quite possible we've
missed points because you know you don't
need all 300 points to win the game
that's just like high score 20 points
are we at I want to see it say enough
they said we were just add we're at a
hundred and fifty out of 300 okay we
might have a ways to go oh yeah Colby
jack cheese it all adds up a wee and we
have no idea what the weird framing on
this police station is the only thing we
can guess is that if they frame it like
this they don't have to draw the entire
station but it's very very strange and
it's frame like that
don't look now but with rich looking at
evidence and Jack making notes they're
actually role-playing as cops just a
little bit that's the whole idea
I love that I love the idea of like a
certain game like making a player write
down notes like I used to do that back
in like NES days you know you have to
write down like the save codes ya know
or you know you have to like draw out
the Zelda map because like it didn't
come with a map so it's like okay I know
this is here and this is here you'd have
to hand draw it out it's great
you ever play the Who Framed Roger
Rabbit game of the Ness oh I did I do it
was not very good at it yeah but there
was a password to get in the door oh
yeah yeah
that wasn't like like a password like a
saved passwords I get like well it said
yes I'm like that you had to write that
down and remember yeah yeah it's fun in
certain games makes you get outside the
game opens oh yeah oh shit I'm breaking
this yeah you are
he just told me about the motel incident
yep good thing keith was there with you

efficient for our police work if we
split up but I just kind of need a hug
if you could have a hug for me I am
physically incapable of having a hug for
you girl if you could give a hug for me
to me okay I guess I'll leave I see a
lamp turned over on the floor and an
ashtray next to him look at lamp it'll
never work again ah barely Miri smokes
look at ashtray all right
in the ashtray I see a poultry bird
piece of paper oh yeah let's do it let's
do it
I know I know come on camon I pick up
the I pick it up but carefully unfolded
I read over the list of names
Roberts Wilkins Coby Barnes
oh my god it's a death list oh no oh I
did not mean that as soon as I said it I
knew that was the wrong thing to say
if this is a death list hopefully we can
solve this case before we turn into an
old man in jokes you know I love them
no summary oh I suppose Marie did
testify against him yeah okay where's
where's death list there's death list
merci merci nothing to myself as I
realize this is Baines hit list and now
that murderous scum bag has Marie oh no
well fuck I'm gonna have to pay for it
now pay for what you don't cousins
sweet sweet cousins taxes she does
really good at doing taxes so now you're
gonna have to pay for your tax way to
get my taxes done little fake potted
plant almost looks real no clues there
can't find them clues wait who's the
other name on that list
Colby Don Colby oh okay table this bear
the phone was on it look at fool look at
her old nose on the sofa with a cord
ripped from the wall oh no if I were to
sound the sofa with the cord ripped
involved oh I said the deep crevices of
the sofa and fine how about that a $2.00
bill I don't see many $2 bills around
really the credit kind of rare thanks
for keeping it light police question I
slipped the bill into my money clip I
mean it's probably stores you know I
mean in spite all the tragedy you just
got to be practical yeah $2.00 is $2.00
right I agree I agree
it's not even dusty I did this Murray's
a very good housekeeper yeah that's how
you knew there was something wrong turn
on TV sit on couch relax
the 19 inch Dinah view color poor Dinah
Dinah view 19 inch that's putting your
whore money to use you get yourself the
big TV the dine of you look at chair
nothing unusual any other clues and look
around okay look at struggle you got to
check everything every little thing
every little details about how
insignificant might be a thing what's
back there look it's nothing that a
kitchen you should go you should
probably go into the kitchen if you want
to look at the kitchen
rich there's signs of a struggle in
Marie's bathroom Marie is not here I
closed the door oh okay I guess I guess
there's nothing to investigate in there
oh I'm back oh wait oh all right all
right that's a kitchen I can't get into
it oh I can't get in here at all oh hey
I found the right pixel look around
somehow the middle of all the met in the
middle of all the mess the kitchen
remains tidy and neat Marie's a good
housekeeper not the best cook the
kitchen hasn't been used in 20 years and
a house is only 10 years old look at
kitchen
alright alright
why is there a kitchen here if there's
nothing I could do in the kitchen
it means I have seen you the kitchen
look in cabinets search cabinets no
clues there looking oven
I think that's an oven right in front of
you there is seven head no sorry you
spoon exact well it's fine it's fine
exactly you're asking the exact wrong
person world building yep it's world
building yeah people have kitchens in
their house take pictures you need to
take some pictures probably take some
pictures before you got the points that
no points for this basically worthless
just say like that's that should be like
your number one job is we want fresh
pictures of the crime scene right every
crime scene
I'm fiddling with this I need a fiddle
confirmed by Jack people have kitchens
in their house yes I know Keith Keith
what are you doing in the bedroom Keith
Keith is taking care of it keep taking
care of business taken care of in
abstract art by Sierra's very own
graphic Titus vu dust the note for
prints for the love of God what note
not worth processing nothing is oh shit
there we go Keith isn't done yet just a
few more minutes nope
oh hey looking closer at the note I
think this is definitely not Murray's
handwriting now dust note a wasted
effort
I don't think gone shopping is
underlined knowledge junkie I think
that's supposed to be the fold in the
paper the note was folded and on the
door so they're saying dust the list
that's almost certainly not going to
work
you do me okay someone is saying they
looked online and they're not gonna tell
us where don't tell us where but they
say the powder is definitely used at one
point in this game that's what they're
saying
use black light on Marie's bedroom Oh
God in the game not necessarily here
just somewhere in the game don't tell us
where cuz with that what when when we
can finally use the powder and obtain a
fingerprint and we're popping champagne
bottles up in here
we took a fingerprint that was
processing all right all right all right
all right that mean did you get
everything you should probably call it
in right yeah
look at the handwriting on the note we
already did that
Yeah right
fuck
like are you supposed to compare the
handwriting on the hit lists to that of
the note to make sure that you know that
it's Baines
maybe if is there a way to do that
just this guy you know says remember
that time rlm posted context lists
pictures of rich dying was that just
because there was nothing new to put on
the patreon or is that just one of
Mike's hobbies probably worth Mike's
hobbies
what do you mean pictures of me dying I
don't recall this that's the thing I'm
not a patreon so I don't I don't know
the stuff they put the patron for the
patrons compared lists you know we'll
try that that's hard
this is police quest two stars Barry
I would absolutely believe that posting
pictures that make it look like riches
died is one of Mike's hobbies back in
February I'm pretty sure rich posed for
them yeah Mike has always had a strange
fascination with me fascination slash
hate it's it's a no it's not a hate he
loves you in a very weird way that's
that's very true very weird way but I
mean that's just Mike he's a weird weird
guy Jack was always conspicuously absent
from the picture on patreon I have
nothing to do with the patreon just
nothing at all
I mean I'm friends with Mike I think
you're good or what is there anything
can you go down that hallway no no are
we just gonna say we're done here I mean
it looks like we're done here I'd ask
the chat I think we should do anything
else but they'll just check the answers
don't check it yeah no but josh is in
the rlm patreon pic what I'm gonna look
up the patreon thick
creating weird internet videos you know
what I don't actually think I've ever
like looked at this no the patreon
picture is like the empty set
I mean Josh might be in it they had a
they had a an amateur photo shoot you
guys had that photo shoot done for the
first best of the worst and I wasn't
there for that episode and we've never
had another photo shoot yeah
so I'm not any like any of the promo
pictures that they use for best of the
worst weird I'm not in any room just cuz
I wasn't there for the first episode of
best of the worst so it's weird it's
weird that you're not in the promotional
photos well I wasn't there I want so
weird we should probably get new ones
but that would require you know like
doing something or stuff you have lines
I'm not gonna tell you read them because
I know you despise the dispatch oh that
was a possible 207 kid no I'll bring
over the information thank you oh we
copied the two or seven kidnappers you
don't great well we'll get it back Sonny
you don't want we're gonna come what
kind of get it well good I mean and if
not everyone else has been dead but
there's gonna be plenty of fishing to
see you know what I'm saying no but some
of them I pressed into yeah I'm
listening I I'm not saying that I
disagree with your choice in in partners
but you know you could find a nice lady
who didn't take money for sucking dicks
if he didn't want to you know there you
go that's what you could do all right
okay
wouldn't want to leak patron only
content but here just this guy no it's
not working
be kept properly because it's patron
only content but don't worry about it
don't worry about it why did you guys do
promo photos for the release abassin it
was like I think like a friend of a
friend was a photographer and wanted to
take some photos and they took some
photos a good reason not to exactly and
you know there have been like their
there has been stuff written about best
of the worst and they've used the promo
yeah the promotional photos like getting
promotional photos is a really good idea
something to hand out easy right and I
just wasn't there and we've never redone
them we probably should redo them yeah
but again we are not we don't think like
that we just make stuff and put it out
there you know we don't think oh you
know it might be good for our brand in
our business if we have promotional
photos maybe we should put out some sort
of press friendly packet we don't think
like that we should do we should take
swimsuit photos for best/worst
absolutely
no we told Keith it was cool to smoking
in the car and Keith asked us if it was
okay to smoke Oh
what choice did we give him half cares
hello sunny you must be like really
scared me I mean my my we've been busy
haven't we oh that's Big John he was the
big dumb guy everybody's big dumb guy to
me we've been really busy man who's your
weight we have sorry here about me sunny
the employees of a solid lead nose time
bring it up bangs
while you were out I dug around the
files and came up with a list of folks
who testified against brains yeah hadar
what are you Robert Todd call me Murray
Wilkins and Sonny bonds Oh hmm everyone
on this list testified against Baynes
and now whether or not only the dead or
missing except you and call me why I
can't Mike I got nothing I just got
nothing I don't know what to do
I guess you fucked I guess you should
probably talk to yourself and see if you
have any leads because there's no one
else we could talk to question is Sonny
will go after you or Kobe next the
evidence see at page no no we're cool
beers oh Jesus Christ
we know this we knew that five minutes
ago captain I'm I'm so far ahead of you
that it's it's kind of a joke it's it's
a fucking joke I mean I personally I
personally got on the phone and I called
Don Kobe five hours ago
five hours ago you know what he told me
to fuck off the man told me he was he
was too bored to talk to me I told him
there's a there's a killer on the loose
and he wants to murder you and he hung
the man the man hung up on me and now
you're telling me that there's a
connection when would I mean for God's
sakes Keith figured that out look at
Keith over there it's it's true captain
I don't know how he's staring at a wall
he's sitting at his desk and he's
staring at the wall he's not doing
paperwork he's not writing anything down
he's just staring at the wall cats
didn't to be fair something might happen
on this wall Sonny I can't tell you for
shit up Keith I'm talking to the cat for
something very talky I'm why am ia the
only man who knows what he's doing why
do I have to do literally fucking
everything pardon my language
Sonny can I can I get up from my desk
now no okay
you know what keep staring at the wall
that's all you tell you good fuck Keith
just stay out of the way and I'll do
everything fucking do everything don't
worry about it I'll tell you what Sonny
I don't even
this is my desk I'm gonna be honest with
you I don't know why it does is the one
is the one in front by the computer yeah
actually they gave you the new computer
oh good
the captain was so happy with your
police work that he gave you the
computer and not me I've got some papers
on a desk yeah I have to use a pencil oh
good I like the computers one ain't what
I seen you I can't say I'm really good
at Oregon Trail I know I can cross all
the rivers and and I know how to use my
ox tongs they let you play Oregon Trail
and a Sierra Brad computer I thought
those were hard-coded only two plays
Sierra games

police quests had to I had to moderate I
even though I'm in a complete imbecile I
know how to mod the computer and I gotta
shoot the Buffalo you like that Buffalo
shooting
you can't shoot too many of them though
cuz you can only carry some what you
meet but yeah I still shoot them all
anyway I kill them all just like my
ancestors what this job brings most
likely is kidnap read user his hostage
he's trying to suck your own other
shuttlepods
even though I just flat-out rather than
everybody else he kidnapped for some
reason I'm gonna assume that Ray still
alive maniac my bomb beams is hard to
