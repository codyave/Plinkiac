you once heard people praise grownups
too I just I don't believe you I think
you're lying to us that's gonna be fine
your perspective is all yes critique my
mspaint drawings more I am gonna work on
both line brain and crocodile brain
emoticons they're probably gonna look
similar to this maybe I'll have rich
draw them because rich actually can draw
I work with a guy who loves grownups -
I'm so sorry I'm really sorry
you
what director has got better later in
their career that's a good question
you know I think any director who got
better later in their career was also
good early on right where it's like you
can look hold on for a second biscuit is
trapped in here
sorry but this cave got trapped I had to
let model um you know like early
scorsese's a little rough and later
Scorsese is just perfect and beautiful
Tarantino once he got money just
polished polished everything up
visca cam absolutely there you know
there's a lot I'm trying to think of a
like a director who was bad at one point
and then and then got good I don't know
biscuits on board right
why Sanderson you know like what
Sanderson like if you look at bottle
rocket you could see what Rhett Wes
Anderson was going to become and I think
he perfected it with Royal Tenenbaums
but really that was just kind of like
polish that wasn't like getting better
that was like having the resources to
achieve his vision who's a director that
was bad that got good
who said polish was good polish can be
good
is good polishing their ideas not
necessarily like apology I'm making it
look good it was just like solidifying
your vision as a director Wes Craven
right bottle rocket is greater than
Rushmore is greater Grinnell that's not
true bottle rocket is not the best mm
Tenenbaums is the best Rushmore is a
very close second
classic Spielberg or modern scorsese
classic Spielberg 100% classic Spielberg
that man had imagination I I really like
classic Spielberg
modern scorsese is great I mean he's
just always great modern Scorsese slash
any Scorsese is great Scorsese but
classic Spielberg oh man that's my Jam's
how is Zelda coming along fine is rich
back yet and radar you back in
he's not rich is not back in rich
someone's asking house-elves is coming
along the Zelda episode we actually just
shot the discussion over the weekend
so I'll start editing it hopefully I can
have something out later this week
the interesting things are interesting
so that is all I will say we I don't
want to spoil the the review for you
we'll talk about it after after the
reviews up we can talk about it more in
depth
when is space cop coming out tomorrow
space cop is coming out tomorrow
spoiler alert they just shot the last
scene this afternoon so Jay and Mike are
dual editing tonight tomorrow morning
I'll probably get some roughs and start
doing effects work and it'll be out
tomorrow afternoon possibly like early
evening
I didn't see love and monsters so I
don't know what breed is my cat my cat
is a Siberian IVA I have a long-haired
Siberian cat which which means which
means that he's hypoallergenic what they
were asking who's there who is this nice
um so the reason that my cat is a
Siberian is because he's hypoallergenic
and I have friends and family including
rich Evans who are allergic to cats so I
got one specifically so rich could still
hang out at my house and he has yet to
be over the big jerk the cats of my
friend bought a cat I told him it was a
fucking asshole it would it would be
fine yeah I've had people over who are
allergic to cats and they've been fine
with no medication you're gonna be fine
fine the special peanuts it'll be fine
it'll be fine
I used Windex on that all of the
surfaces it'll be fine no I'm sorry
important question of why are a lot of
the old RLM videos not working anymore
old Plinkett reviews aren't working that
can't be true
if they're not up on YouTube that
they're still on the blips check about
they're fine everything's fine they're
up or you know a lot of times blip has
player issues so if if you're watching a
harlem video player and it's not working
try again the next day they have they
have server issues all the time that
blip Oh Rach when did you get here you
were you were cutting in and out and so
I I heard some random guy talk it was
weird
I just got back Oh some random guy yeah
I just heard it was really weird it was
almost demonic the signals got crossed
that could be that was probably it yeah
yeah
that was probably it okay hold on I'm
gonna okay rich let's start up Monaco
I'm starting it up starting at Monaco
right I never argue I got I never turned
it off oh well we tested this then there
you go okay Monaco coming back on I
haven't been able to get the Phantom
Menace review to play in over six months
on blip that can't be true I'll let Jay
know about that yes what the fucking man
what the fuck in Monaco I think what
you're asking is what the fuck is Monaco
Jack Monaco is a place and you can't
fuck in it I'm sure you can fuck in
Monaco but the question was what the
fuck in Monaco and I don't think that's
a real question just putting that out
there
so Monaco I have bought also by the way
I don't really know what Monaco is I
think it's a stealthy thing mmm I don't
know
are you making a Lobby or something or
you know what you're doing I am working
on it okay
are you in are you in Monaco yes okay
look at lobbies yes I am creating a
Lobby nothing is there and check now

join the game great I have connected to
server all right what are the god say
these characters do different things
yeah so the locksmith is very fast at
picking locked stores and save the
cleaner can knock out unsuspecting
enemies the pickpocket has a pet monkey
that collects loot the lookout can
detect distant enemies while sneaking I
think I'm gonna be the lookout okay
because I want to detect distant enemies
I also know pre prereq has never
reviewed Monaco right yeah what do you
think jack cleaner or locksmith I would
say locksmith right if I can see enemies
we can sneak around I mean if you're
fast luck picker it's a good thing okay

what did hear myself shit shit
oh hey there's like little passageways
here they don't have guns it's the
French but the guards better get more
difficult to deal with at some point
because getting caught so far is just
like nothing well that's and there I see
in the chat here they're saying how is
this a stealth game when you can simply
knock everyone out without repercussion
and I agree we have it we also like
early yet and we have guns eventually
I'm hoping they start shooting this yeah
