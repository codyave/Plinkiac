all right we should be streaming a game
I hope if this is all gone correctly
just know there's no guarantee it has no
guarantee at all no guarantees in life
looks like we're starting up that's
great
things are happening
tiny turnip you are mine my only viewer
right now in the the chat you're about
to go to work alright have have had fun
at work I I hope to still be playing
when you get back we'll we'll see what
happens
I think I think I might have at this
time all right
no to to start off we're gonna we're
gonna recap what happened last time I
tried this Dead Rising no death run I
know a lot of people in the chat what
sure let's start to fill up it's nice
that's nice you were probably here last
time
Monday night everybody well last time I
did this I was having a pretty good run
we lost a couple people a survivors died
but I was I was near the end of the game
and I think it was clear sailing for me
to the end before my xbox decided to
freeze on a loading screen so that's
that's not my last run I did we froze on
a loading screen so here's here's what's
going on this time last time I wasn't
saving specifically because I did not
want to overwrite my old game pretty big
gun rising fan and I didn't want to
erase everything I had unlocked and and
all of that jazz so I wasn't saving what
is different this time is I have now
created a new profile so we now have a
I'm playing on a special prereq profile
I made so this should save til its own
separate dead rising save file
I hope actually I know I kind of I kind
of tried earlier so we're good we're
good with saves the other thing I've
done this is the last time I flat-out
forgot that you could install games to
the damn xbox360 hard drive so my game
was was running from the disk last time
this time it's installed under the drive
so that should also keep out any any
freezing shenanigans I hope you're about
to go again
um I'm gonna have a great run it's gonna
be great run
hello everybody hello and I am not
skipping cutscenes if if you don't like
that you know what the door is we're
gonna rewatch all these things that we
already watched once because I enjoy
them hey buddy
you mentioned something about research
for a story that's right got a tip that
something bigs happening in a nowhere
little town like that they sure didn't
mention anything about it on TV
yeah well I'm freelance pal I don't make
new hobby
thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it
eight months in a row I still haven't
figured out how to say that months part
and I got some singsong it doesn't work
but I appreciate great William at
Colorado population fifty-three thousand
five hundred ninety-four distinguishing
characteristic
Jack shit but the only thing to do in
this town Sears kill time
here's missing mom here's what's going
on in my head with with this know death
run I really want to play the other
games but I need I need to get through
this fucker first I need to do this I
need to know death run Dead Rising 1 so
I get let myself play Dead Rising 2
because so somebody actually gifted me
Dead Rising 3 which that was great that
was great they did it before it went on
sale like like a couple of days ago
Hotel before the Nationals so and that
was really generous take me over I want
to play through all the games I don't
know what I'm gonna know death run all
of them especially three just because
I've never played it before and I you
know I don't have familiarity with
what's going on in three so I need I
need I need to beat this so I can move
on to - I don't know if I'm gonna do
dumb I don't know if I'm gonna stream
it's I don't know I don't know just yet
if I'm going to uh stream a no death run
of of - I might I might I'm gonna be
easier than Dead Rising one
but I just I just want to play through
the whole series I got six points
because I zoomed out that sucks
and of course my my strategy here is
exactly the same as it was last time
a level up early and often
yeah I'm kind of sad you people know I'm
streaming so quickly it's kind of
amazing
shouldn't you shouldn't I be planning in
my wedding
there's here's what's yours what's going
on with that I really want to get
married to Carrie I love her to death
but as far as actual wedding plans I
whatever she wants is my answer whatever
she wants no idea one thing's for sure
because I love Roscoe and I want to get
married
I really do want to grow into it but I
mean in my eyes the actual marriage the
wedding that's just that's just a
ceremony I care less about that then I
do being able to just say never
hey I'd be happy to set a date she is I
don't know if I I think I explained this
once that dumb right when I came up to
Wisconsin to be more involved with red
letter media I mean we didn't we didn't
know how well this was going to work out
wasting a lot of photos on that okay we
didn't know if this is gonna work out
for me up here and it didn't make any
sense to to move her up here if things
were gonna go bad you know just had to
move back so I mean she stayed she's
still in in Chicago and she's she's
taking her sweet-ass time moving up here
but whatever she wants to move up here
that way that we can get specific
but children expert wants to know when
this started well we leave in a way we
haven't even really started yet I'm in
the game the game doesn't really start
so you're in the mall proper so where
you're you are at the beginning you've
missed nothing
and I didn't fuck up the exploding gas
station picture this time so I'm happy
about that
and even if I work trying to level up
quickly I still what's given don't skip
cutscenes you know this isn't really a
cutscene
I mean sigh EE what the skipper
I was I was going to wait till Monday
before doing this again but say I got a
mental why I want plate the second game
I can't I can't do that until I can get
through this fucker first this is the
thing that has to happen
I want to see the center of town take me
there
I've seen them all
judge bred the stream is crazy early for
one because this happens to be the time
we felt like the game got caught up with
what I had the dude into the studio
today and had some time on my hands
plus a day no death threat of dead
rising we'll take a second or so hours
so makes sense the startling raw nuts
listen don't forget to come and I'm
worried it's gonna be a dull spoon for
you guys because I'm gonna be playing
through a writing the same if I'm gonna
climb through all of the same shit you
saw me do last time we did this that
name cuz the hole near the fight
I really want to do a perfect run like I
really want to save everybody and
complete all old little errand missions
ploy one spot on the line can you bring
the money the safe room just like that
motion I want to do all that shit too
but besides you know I I will abandon
the myth time wise I don't think I can
do it without missing a little scoop or
another case zero my hair my fryer is my
third priority is not dying
I will only end the stream if I actually
died but I will not be happy unless I
get the true ending so second priority
do all of the the main story Case Files
third priority save everyone I can
I'm getting way out of it this time god
damn it I'm saving Leigh Leigh uh Leah
however you pronounce her name I'm gonna
save her yeah and I'm freelance already
saving everybody and then feel alone
completing their little errand quest
that's best thing near the bottom of the
priorities anyway and then um I don't
know if it's being but possibly but it
would be really cool if I can um end the
game at the at level 50 which is the
highest human level frank west if it
were just a riot but i'm that's that's
like the last priority because time not
even sure that's the more - that's
numerically physically impossible
extend through the game pity there's uh
something else I can't put my finger on
doesn't sound like civil disobedience
it's too quiet what most a thief
everyone's already did whistle fish both
games had the mega annoying
walkie-talkie but I don't care about
achievements so if I miss a message from
Otis I don't give a flying fuck because
you get an achievement for answering all
of the calls fuck that fuck that this is
my friend is hell
tgd Finnick I can't do a spiked bat
spike packs spiked bats don't come in
until uh until two there will be spikes
when I scream - I don't know like I said
I don't know if I'm gonna try no death
run on - I I'm a similar to how I'm
doing the Dead Rising one no death runs
on off days
I'm a stream a live play of the whole
game but I don't know if I'll guarantee
that'll be a new death run I've only
played through Dead Rising 2 twice
because my second time through white I
to save everybody and do all the case
files because Dead Rising 2 is like a
fuck
it's Dead Rising 2 is a metric fuck ton
easier it's it's one of my major reasons
why I prefer one yes III did have the
Megaman gun but but I think I think
that's safe file I Xbox go bad and I
think I lost the world hard drive to
everything and basically I'm playing on
this is my my third xbox because the
hardware on the Xbox is a piece of shit
and I don't think any of my old save
information was on this drive even
though I do have a fully level Frank
West Dead Rising I don't know I don't
know if I'm my my main save if I have
that unlocked the Mega Buster the real
Mega Buster but I did at some point even
if I did have that unlocked I wouldn't
be using it because this hold the whole
goal here is to try to do this starting
at level one so even if that were
unlocked on my other save we wouldn't be
able to use it and I don't know that I
would choose to use it I felt I feel bad
using the mini chainsaws
because they feel so cheap I'm gonna do
it cuz this run would be over real
fuckin bitch without it but
hey bring that over here
you guys you guys happy with the audio
balance sound of the game compared to
the sound I mean I did a test before we
stream that sound fine to me but I can
adjust the audio on things if you guys
want
hey this is no time to ogle pretty girls
son you're looking to get yourself beats
alive by a zombie sounds good great what
did you just say zombies take a look out
there your those ain't zombies what
would you call
there's been more and more of them since
last week she'll be happy to know that
when I spend blood rising - there will
be plenty of spice plenty of spice look
on the bright side zombies are stupid
and slow despite bad spy gloves we
should be spectral pain tanks all right
yeah we like making yourself useful take
a look around the mall now I know what
we can use for this is a witch heaven so
back here on delight pronto
hey my car off at home editing things
and those things made or inform a not
but probably may involve the new Mad Max
movie
fantastic which I am going to avoid Mad
Max spoilers so I'm not gonna talk about
it much but I I saw it I don't speak for
Mike or J but fucking awesome

fantastic
such more pictures
fantastic
mr. smile
fantastic
fantastic
fantastic
I could be wrong hipster Superman but I
think we'll a man might actually be a
real town I think they named it after a
place but I could be wrong where are the
others
I don't know I hope they got away
also go see Mad Max
as long as those things are in the mall
I'm gonna say this about these do he
quote controversy unquote I know you
doing care what your politics are the
claims made about the movie they're just
they're just wrong actually and
apparently those things aren't smart
enough to use the Ducks if you if you
love or or hate wait a minute feminism
normally bends right in or whatever the
fuck in this war it's irrelevant Mad Max
is just a good action movie and Matt the
Mad Max characters every bit as
prominent and active as he was in the
road warrior probably more so nice
camera ru and the reason he doesn't say
much and the trailers because he doesn't
say much in the movie list and that's
the journalist that's impaling dozen
pictures ring
you really seem to know what you're
doing who are you guys anyway and what
are you I took that one near the
entrance that guy do something nice wiki
says Willamette is fictional least
Colorado Illinois okay no okay thanks
for showing me that I can't be right
about everything
uh hey we're not done talking yet met
mad max has the eyes some of the most
satisfying action scenes I've seen in
decades I'm Jesse the man you saw
earlier is Brad that's all I'm
authorized to tell you
to do master you want me to do my master
blaster I used to annoy my coworker on
my first job by doing master blaster who
runs Bartertown
Master Blaster Master Blaster
say again master blaster runs Bartertown
louder master blaster runs Bartertown
not yet energy
hey anybody around
Jeff stop crying and talk to me
stop crying I'll hit you with my bat
I know it's not a popular opinion but I
actually like Beyond Thunderdome
quite a bit mister yeah the first half's
better than the second but it's fine
movie I think overall even
fantastic yeah
by going for the Franklin pimp
achievement no I'm not going for any
achievement I'm just going for a no
death run no deaths save everybody
perfect ending if if possible do
everybody's fetch quest but I'm far less
certain about that over there if my time
limits getting really tight I'm not
gonna bother with giving so-and-so a
bottle of wine that said I'm gonna try
and make sure I do the side quests that
keep people from leaving because I'm
trying to save as many people as I can
yeah
okay stock priest five that's good
it's good that that happened
all right shut up Otis shut up shut up
Otis Otis shut up shut up okay there we
go late leah is not always doomed I
rarely lose lay up which is why I have a
so pissed and you know last time in the
convicts killer had a feeling you'd show
up
I I was going to wish it to the the
cornfield I'm so glad somebody got that
that reference did please don't turn me
into a jack-in-the-box up on me
Brad was attacked I located him on the
monitor oh it's probably just a sprain
I've got to help Brad or he's done for
all right fine
give me a gun come on I'm the reason you
just got hurt let me help
no I can't let us if you're known needed
the sky kids yeah well I don't because
in order for Mad Max to have some kind
of redemption some kind of character for
the trilogy know how to use this he
needed people to save he needed someone
to cover to redeem him by by saving the
children he gains bit he gains back a
little bit of his humanity
look after I'm through helping you you
that's why I like thunder nice little
chat obviously told wise it's way
different from road warrior and I love
road warrior because it's so fucking
brutal and cynical rich me tell you
about awesome man Max's oh yes not
spoiling anything I Baylor's hear that
people ringing endorsement
while C's zombie zombie stop
I'm going with the same general overall
strategy I use when I'm nearly there
deaf won the game for the Xbox decided
fucking over that means I'm going to be
making a lot of quickstep also cool fun
spots a town and and dare I say I might
like Tom Hardy more as Mad Max it's it's
actually much easier
it's actually almost a darker take on
Max and the original take was dark
one of our way in there
yes I know I know Mr Clegg it said that
dark isn't always good and that's true
however is a very appropriate format box
before I play the new Mad Max game I
might play it it looks bad your
girlfriend sent me to find you for one I
don't want to build my own car I want to
drive the fucking dog pursuit special I
just want to drive that car and Burnley
you lose that right away I'm gonna use
that gun
not every fighting system purse should
be the Batman fighting system so I'm not
looking forward to that
all right I'll cut it out from here I
don't know about Mad Max game the
shadows try to get close to the target
okay
and what am I supposed to do when I get
close tag you stop by the chat with the
best thank you happy to shoot the guy
Jack I'm gonna try this until I do it
off and I'm gonna keep trying dodgy
until I stay it off I don't think you
realise are you up to it how close I
came last time a lot better with a
camera but yeah I'll give it a shot all
right
next time you reloads I'll lay down a
suppressing fire I'm counting on you
make your way over there you see Jack I
want to play the other games in the
series when I'm just in the mood I'm
gonna I'm at a big dead rising price
psychologically I need to get through
this game first before I move on to two
I just can't let myself move on without
sit here way out
fuck off
Jack I see you in the chat and then your
you are completely and utterly full of
shit they already know that I've already
gushed
you see it so they make more movies with
practical effects I mean this movie
needs to be a success because the
effects that the action scenes are
fucking amazing like that last stretch
of the movie Moke most excited I've been
buy an action cinema years many years
you suck
when I play all of the Mad Max movies
it's not just max I mean they're all
good characters
and I know a lot of people like to say
that what's very self curiosa
stole the show I think the most
interesting character was probably nuts
the guy with the white white makeup
there's a lot of guys in white makeup
but the major one who had like full
white body makeup on got away
who was that anyway I don't know the
names of characters in the new Mad Max
is sort of silly yeah I know it's not
like the Mad Max movies with Lord
humungus and a Master Blaster
photojournalist and right they have an
explanation then you thanks bread
they've all done it and it's great sorry
I've got nothing to tell you
look
I don't know what Jesse told you but as
far as I'm concerned we're through
working together so you cover your
zombies mr. Schine smile the guy that
wanted to go to Val palace

money because oh how glorious would it
be if they started making kick-ass
brutal r-rated movies again
how glorious you win Frank let's work
together thank you thank you for wishing
me luck Chet Jesse and I are DHS agents
and yes we are looking for the man in
that picture you're with Homeland
Security is that guy a terrorist or
something
I took that picture of the entrance
Plaza right near the front doors lux the
guy from the zombie romance I have no
idea
I honestly don't know he was the same
actor I haven't seen this on people
you're talking about hey so do I have
your permission to cover this story or
not
rich do you wish you had a sassy black
sidekick instead of Jack I thought I
thought Jack was my my sexy black
sidekick checks black right
it's dumb and food why my not grabbing
food daddy a moving racing the clock
racing the clock I get in trouble as
waste one of my quick stuffs are my way
zombie scum
are you wasting time there's no can't
shoot them all go to the floor so we can
get them all we need to go exact tell
them faster now let's move now so much
to slept with my chance on my breath
very disappointed very disappointed
time for orange juice times roll
bread is actually faster than I have
kindly cut was interesting and wrap this
whole thing up
no I'm not leaving until you come
guarantee me safe passage us to open
these gates just open this gate offer
you protection I am not opening any gate
thank you for your sake crunch I can do
an overhead attack sir push broom
excellent doctor it's not it totally
breaks that you can do the interesting
attack actually the head breaks off and
then it turns into like a spear
well what happened you can't just arrest
him he turned down my offer to protect
him said he isn't going anywhere until
they can guarantee a secure route out of
you did I see Mad Max in 3d oh god no I
hate 3d Jessie I hate him the first
thing we need to do is to call for
backup
the few times I've seen a 3d movie I
spent I spent a quarter to half of the
movie like like pulling my mic my
glasses up and squinting at the string
because I know I don't think it's
comfortable at all why I hate 3d
the marketing 100
100
fantastic it wasn't worth power
like last time cuz my goal is the level
up quick I'm grabbing this book here
which gives me like a 25% increase in
the amount of points you get for doing
survivor related stuff and considering
I'm going to try and save everybody that
should net me some levels walk faster
level fantastic 25% faster yes I took a
photo of that tent because if you line
the camera up right you get a thousand
points for doing it
leveling up this part my strategy go
past the picture I just took of of Wendy
and her love spur album add thousand
points this this cartoon Fox thousand
boys fantastic level up see that's how
it works
yes this is a note that one I'm doing my
best to make this a perfect run we'll
see what happens
they should always go how you planned
first priority is not going second
priority is getting good ending third
priority is saving everybody now big
fourth priority is completely some
completing some of their side quest
e-type request
is it possible to beat the game without
killing a single zombie hmm technically
yes
I mean you could just wait on the roof
for three days to your helicopter
arrives we're gonna get a ship ending
and you'll just sit there for eight
hours doing nothing but you you will you
won't get an ending without an official
ending without killing a single zone as
far as trying through the main quest I
suppose in theory I wouldn't want to try
it never do madness I wouldn't be fun
madness
okay all right
shit that zombie go shoot that fucking
zombie are you suck yeah you should have
shot shut he wouldn't be grabbing you
what he felt would it

I got everything any no I won't open the
door now is the time for the door come
on come on come on come on rich can you
pick up an entire Sundy and use it as a
weapon yes you can but I'm gonna need to
level up a bit before I get there we
started this game from scratch so I I
like don't have any of the moves you
normally have in this game
thank you very much I think that's
choose between that cream and a melee
weapon come on take picture of that door
and I'll get in the way of my door
picture
Oh
you're standing right there fuck it
damnit did I platinum bloodborne I don't
bother platinum in games I don't bother
with achievements I just play the game
and have fun
hmm so that's what dr. Barnaby said huh
the old codes not dumb he wants us to
call for help first we got a light out
or what
the signals being blocked i can't even
contact HQ on the emergency line so if
you want to get our hands on dr. Barnaby
we're gonna have to secure a way out of
here ourselves all right we've got to
deal with the situation we've been
handed the boneheads back at HQ might be
working on something too
there's a helicopter coming three days
from now at noon it's my note Rancic I
think in the context of this game it's
my fair to say that I run out a sword
service yes that's how I plan on getting
out of here all right then I'll see to
it that the DHS picks up the chairman
I'm not a concept of trophies I hate it
when trophies actually I hate it's going
on trophies have kind of replaced I'll
tell you which one lockable is an
actually content like business right now
Peter not hard and you get the SPECIAL
past you if we have to wait here for now
you get in the hard you get the trophy
that says you'll be done right Oh Mike
isn't alike
we'll get dark hour to be here tomorrow
morning you remember I want you to keep
this spider-man game on the PlayStation
we're doing the things that would
normally be achievements would give you
different costumes and sometimes the
different costumes would have different
abilities different powers like one
would make you stronger the the symbiote
calcium would give you unlimited webbing
funds fun stuff fun stuff that enhanced
game
it's a shining artifact of the past all
right I need this picture
fantastic and I need to make sure we
don't lose that picture and that's off
to save Sophie that's Accra Feist
I know on the other stream somebody
asked me why I take the elevator down
why don't I just go around and jump on
the shelves because you're trying to do
a perfect run in this game good name
enemies time and then I think it's just
a tiny bit faster to take you out of
here
maybe not even by that much but I think
it's faster and that's why I do it
Jack I see you argue against me in the
chest no if you without taking damage
instead of getting an achievement
wouldn't you rather get like the the
unlockable specially done with with
extra damage when you enter let me write
about looking rather unlock there
wouldn't you rather actual content as a
reward instead of pretend bragging right
content
there's no fucking shoot
anywhere near that fuck dude
I hear them I don't see them
the scared oh fuck I mean is what they
do
right Jack you say the alternative or
the alternative to no trophy is nothing
but that's that's not true before
trophies you did get things like in Dead
Rising this is one of the early Xbox
games what are your lure games that had
trophies its astrophys but it still has
regular content - like things that give
you trophies also give you unlockable
costumes unlockable weapons like this
the real Mega Buster that everyone talks
about
no both I'm fine with a boat but it's
like these days you don't get both you
just get the achievement and I think
that's because they think it's
acceptable just to slap a trophy one
there they can get away with it that's
why they're doing
Kofi's have come to replace unlockables
and content usually they don't grab me
once I've got thee one was about wasn't
holding somebody's hand
come on
alright didn't level up for that but
I'll take what I can get
so put down something in that business
I'll get you back fantastic business
taken care of hi
so many little details I can forget that
will cost me a perfect love through
incidentally for the record that that
picture I took that's for the Kent the
KITT mission is tomorrow if I want to
continue that storyline and I need to
because there is a survivor tied to it I
need to bring Kent a erotica photo worth
I think at least 750 points and that is
a photo worth 750 points there's a
better picture I can take later but may
as well may as well get the one I can
get now before I forget
all right we're off to the clone
of course they're right by the door and
that's not shocking the bastards
by hat - ivenn e-waste a quick stuff to
get around them I don't think I'll need
to
oh gosh
all right what do I need before the
cloud
yeah
Frank doesn't die when he gets shot
because video game logic we all know
this we all know this
I'm discovering that I have greatly
underestimated be regular chainsaw gonna
tie this up first roof later viewers and
they watch this
Oh mr. Superman you say that the regular
chainsaw finnie minimus I'm not argue
that minis are a lot more useful but
I've discovered some things about the
regular chainsaw as hard as well against
this boss but later on I will I will
endeavour circuit only rarely the
regular chainsaw has it over mini
chainsaws that be much later if we get
that I going off to sleep now and do
other things
have a nice night
like wow
onde oh wow the last shot at program I
told them that was fucking great
yeah
Hokkien before the lights went out I'm
very happy about that
yeah
all right so that's the first thing the
regular chainsaw has you don't sleep
there's not really a pause before swings
so you can you can just keep hitting
that that button yep still be moving so
it's like continual damage which is nice
we have Greg to the egress
don't they call that where you going
why are you going back right going back
the way forward is is forward Greg
they waste all this chainsaw juice
hello
as technically he's not joined the group
yet that's fine that's fine
yet another secret stream we're trying
this again we're gonna do it this time
cuz I'm fuckin determined
what are you doing
fantastic
yes I appreciate Roger I'll get you back
come on
come on
come on
over there where the fuck are you guys
get in here
come on all right
follow me
follow me you guys stuck in there Shinji
get out of the women's restroom
got shit to do tonight follow me

help is doing
over there
all right
get them zombies
I need some things from you guys I'm
gonna need my shit back Roger
yeah
follow me
follow me
get up there
who
yo Frank give me a hand here what what
gives
considering the helicopter and all we
have to work together
but that doesn't mean I'm gonna make
another quick step and we kept saying
that gun store can't necessarily be
printed yeah so so I just want you to
appreciate the situation well we're up
to our necks and zombies yeah I think I
appreciate the situation just fine
zombies I still can't believe all this
you know seems so unreal how's the beer
coming along I trimmed it today it's
still there for now
you all right there yeah I got it
you should rest a while Brad
you go ahead and catch some sleep first
we can switch in four hours okay
yeah
Oh
day one has gone well with they tease
when it starts getting real
I believe that chainsaw is my weak water
that I used a bus Shh hey I hear like a
server many times I hate using the
muchachos they feel they feel so cheap
yeah you you can't speedrun this game
the clock for the helicopter is gonna
come about when it comes about you can't
increase the speed on that
should have went the other way
she went to the park I might take this
back was done but I think it matters
yes for anybody who wasn't here earlier
Mad Max not gonna spoil anything fuckin
awesome it's so awesome it's awesome
what does that mean but it's awesome
you speed up
look mister if we're gonna fight these
zombies we need guns electrician named
zombies bad as far as I can throw that's
just people even less don't shoot
look let's pop this open talk to my
12-gauge don't get no closer I'll blow
y'all to kingdom come
you know god damn it I warned you a
situation like this nobody yeah
yeah
damn mister come on now what are you
crazy
you want you want good so bad that y'all
yeah
a perfect
fantastic
fantastic oh shit I got the Japanese
book oh fuck
all right all right that's not a big
deal using a lot of fucking points
though
yeah
Oh
I think I got enough time to kill I can
do this I'm going to go back before
going to the safe house I'm bringing
this guy all the way to the bookstore or
I can get more points for rescuing
survivors because like an idiot
I dropped the wrong book I dropped the
wall whose book and instead of the
Japanese language book which I didn't
need the boiler my gun
so everyone I've rescued since then I
got 25% less prestige points than I
would have very disappointing
ah
he's looking up at chef I almost I miss
right off without you David
why didn't write it you spawn in my arms
I needed to go this way to make quick
step anyway I know I gotta carry your
centerboard I'm like I never come back
again
you get knocked out of my arms right now
I want a cuddle
yes I'm going to save this time the
reason I didn't last time is because I
didn't want to overwrite my actual
normal dead rising save with all my shit
that was unlocked this time I started a
new profile which apparently will let me
have a second safe so we're good we're
good
that's good stop worrying
I'm even installed on the hard drive now
so in theory it shouldn't be a problem
at all
I'll just play out of my way first a few
thousand extra points and then nuts in
that cookie wrong wrong store wrong
store
I won't have to wrap something
the reason I'm getting through these
crowds so easily is that the advantage
of carrying somebody is the game goes a
bit easy on you when you carry a
somebody they'll they could still swipe
at you but they don't do the grab news
so I'm kind of immune that grabs right
now
they actually survivors you have to to
carry are actually a lot easier to
escort than the garden-variety you don't
want to you don't want to be escorting
two cripples at once though that's bad
one purple at a time that's that's my
rule
I've heard text on school I cannot see
myself
all right
I have time to make a quick step before
the next mission starts I'll be happy
I've lost out on a lot of lemon just
that I'll make up for I'll make up for
it
eventually considering I lost a layout
last time we on the whole we might be I
might be even did I go too far
just usually don't go around that way
it's time to make quick-set that did it
you've got to be worth a decent amount
points
follow me
Thanks
yeah-oh upgraded my throw that's great
there's everybody everybody happy
everybody's happy we've saved Frank
West's head his nap everything's good
so you're betting on my xbox red ringing
huh all right
as possibility this is my third fucking
expose cuz they are pieces of shit
the reason I still have my xbox eight
eight xbox or it's not mine that I feel
is mine just like food it's because it's
dead right because it's this game and
kind of Ninja Gaiden 2 remembers a
version of that on ps3 they did suck all
the blood out of it though because
stupid just because stupid
fantastic I saw something you may not
know toy laser sir doubles as a
flashlight doesn't do much damage though
so rare I got da extra time in this game
whatever boobs do I have unlocked here
and don't I have any of my grappling
stuff yet oh I got two of speedups
that's not bad that's not bad at all
that's gonna help a lot the key speed
now a football tackle man yeah
best stay on my orange - fun is where I
get shit done and my my territory
hunters no way I'm gonna eat that pie
now it's just that's just that's just
not gonna
no I've never used one of these chairs
as a weapon I'm gonna get super
ineffective you know a frank list or a
smarter man he'd be dealing more looting
right about now
fantastic
oh thank you behind me
but fantastic you get to the safe
playtime is over I would have liked to
have had more I wanted to go to the food
court and there's a bunch of things you
can do in the food court to get prestige
points but that shouldn't the
shenanigans with David I didn't have
time I could probably do some of that
stuff later
fuck 6:00 a.m. what time is it
I got we got time
well you got time
Hey
hey don't eat that Thanks
hey you saved my life
wait what are you doing in here with
those two losers they like your parents
or something but she just keeps crying
and crying I wouldn't want to be stuck
in that room oh my god right
oh my
as bradon's come this on these but you
know that get out
what does I'm actually gonna choose to
talk to you for a change
I understand
Oh
what
got 15 in-game minutes to kill
this will give you a good idea of what
game time it was compared to real time
ah I don't have really enough time to go
kill zombo's oh my god I've got I've got
seconds I've got seconds to go maybe a
minute I get like make it down the
elevator and then come back up I want to
be liked by this door on the neck
mission when the next mission comes up
so I'm not wasting any fucking time big
Ron the maximum number of people you can
save in this is 53 but that's only if
you actually get one of them the less
good endings if you want to get the best
possible ending than most people you can
save as 51 which is what I'm going for
I have not lost any survivors yet right
now oh shit
talking to you guys door open and then
the time oh hi oh my god oh my god I
know everyone is alive I'm having a
perfect run so far I've made some
mistakes but it hasn't caused me any
survivors drop the wrong book and that
pissed me off good what's going on
anyway before this whole thing started
someone called the professor and told
him to come to this mall check the line
did you
Kaspar why what why why are there less
survivors for the best ending look watch
the game and find out bees don't date
I don't know need to apologize
buttermilk biscuits my fault I mean guys
if you default of course be none of our
questions will be answered
let's go make up for that second I lost
am i doing overtime mode probably yes
that's that's presuming that something
doesn't go home as long if nothing goes
horribly wrong we are doing overtime get
out of my fucking way no time Otis no
time
don't be daydreaming out here
so much if people don't know what
overtime Moto's don't let don't tell
them in the chat it will hopefully find
out Pachamama
it's the professor
if we don't do something professor is
gonna end up zombie chow
I'm going for it you just worry about
staying alive got it I hope I don't run
into that bug again during this fight
last time I did this I almost glitched
myself to death I got caught in a taking
damage animation and I kept losing
health it was not fair at all but why
should we expect life to be fair oh you
fucker
no chances no chances never seen him do
that shoulder bumps so much he's
unconscious but alive all right you know
can you get him back to the security
room
oh my god
the sedatives taken effect the professor
won't be waking up anytime soon
brat is apparently the only person in
this game who is not mostly immune to
bullets I managed to stop the bleeding
but he's running a fever
he needs medicine
a fever
medicine huh people on the check
don't don't spoil plot elements of this
game for people just don't this games
too fun either watch me do it
or do it on your own cuz this games good
well you shouldn't track it down
fantastic fantastic fantastic fantastic
fantastic
fantastic
fantastic so if you wanna know how
Japanese this game is look at look at
Frank's nosebleed
yeah
she can hear you but she's she's totally
focused on Brad I think she's got the
hots for Brad I don't I don't think
Frank chance stands most of a much of a
chance
oh it's time for orange juice
just heal
oh I mean you do that
up capture froze hold up
hold up
I see I see I'm working on it I'm gonna
start stop the stream and start the
stream
