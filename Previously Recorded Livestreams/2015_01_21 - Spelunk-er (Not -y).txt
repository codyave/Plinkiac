but versus roguish because no I'll lose
rich clearly I lose I'm good you know
what I'm gonna play Oh
I'm placing I'm a place in Metroid I'm
rusty and rich is like a courier you can
you didn't even respond to any gotham
comments I come up now viscid Gotham is
the worst why particularly this one says
because it has too much Bruce Wayne oh
oh I figured if people didn't like it it
was because it had they was too much
about Gordon Gordon no do you think
there's too much Bruce would know I mean
he I guess he does he even show up and
every single episode was even in the
last well I think he's in a little I
didn't see the last last one but I think
he's in and every episode at least a
little bit I'm gonna lose a second while
I update this dream
see see I'm okay with Bruce Wayne being
in it a lot because it's not an age
we've seen a lot of Bruce Wayne like the
months year right after the murder
yeah it's unexplored Bruce Wayne usually
it's if they explored it's in it's in
flashback mode but but usually it goes
like you go from the death and then you
almost go straight to intense training
to be Batman and then in putting on the
costume for the first time yeah oh
you're gonna hate spelunker it is so
merciless I've never played it's your
little guy can't see your little guy can
fall like six inches it's like he's got
that that osteogenesis imperfecta or
something and his bones just break or
he's in like some planet where the
gravity is like six times the gravity on
earth you're gonna yeah it would be a
good game you can't fall that high yeah
you can't fold it Oh like you can't even
fall like regular people distances this
isn't like Mario we got old gravity
where he jumps three times its height I
mean like you can't even fall like a
foot and a half like a real person could
with no problem at all how do you guys
osteoporosis yeah but a steel Genesis
imperfecta that's that brittle bone
thing like really brittle bones disease
this this new voice you're hearing is my
fiancee this is Karen the nerd she she
says hello i and she said many times
tonight
good Navin
got a fancy parties oh my god you can't
fall from that height no exactly like I
said I can keep at it he's mining on a
planet with like three times the mass of
Earth the Sun City Falls it's like in
Falls 100 feet are simply CJ no this is
the reason yeah I avoided spelunky for
years right because I thought it was
like a take on spelunker see all they
need to do with somebody needs to hack
this to make it just a little easier a
little more merciful a little less
ridiculously yeah exactly I have the
actual cartridge of this at home I never
I'm gonna I'm gonna do this I've played
through a few stages I mean you can get
to the point
but yeah it's maddening damn it Oh a
very young loose Wayne exploring the
caves below the mansion a very young
Bruce Wayne with with brittle bones this
is no exploring caverns on a planet the
size of Jupiter yes I'm ready I can do
this thank you can't you smack I'm ready
for this I don't think you are jack
we're glad to have your approval I can
do this rich I have not played since
revenge
oh my god Oh Montezuma's Revenge
no that is well its diarrhea but it's
their game by that they Eve it doesn't
involve diarrhea no I think they're just
trying to be jerks okay I know I thought
maybe some game designer thought they'd
be cute and named their game Nando's
montezuma's revenge after the tourist
stuff I mean if that's also possible
they're very well all right some of
those 80s game designers had some pretty
good senses of humor yeah like you know
maniac mansion where they got that video
game called muff-diver
yeah when that when the thought the
smoke comes out that's kind of like us
it's like a little tiny volcano or
something I see that this is a very
strange game
oh I got farther it could be a decent
game if it just wasn't so ridiculously
hard I'm ready I'm in it I mean a trifle
it's been long he's like this but not so
pretty good no miner Joe somebody made a
game called gold miner Joe gold miner
Joe go buy ten years ago that was a lot
of fun I got this you guys don't even
know how much I have this it was sort of
reminiscent of this but it was easier a
lot easier and more fun and
light-hearted be Jack Jack stop dying
yeah yeah I knew you weren't gonna like
spelunker
hey I don't actually know what this he's
not exposed to you know you can enjoy
spelunker what with the game genie began
settle out of that stuff like infinite
lives and stuff I got this so you can
just die over and over again
I picture this with megaman music ever
played monster party monster party knows
how to play monster monster party it's a
cheesy game where you run around and
swing a baseball bat at monsters except
when you take a pill and turn into a
flying dragon that shoots fireballs and
it's god is this a game you made up
no it's an NES game from way back when
and and it's got great music and great
character great great villains the
villains are all kinds of strange things
and kapha throws baby cats at you a
giant I'm sorry what a giant venus
flytrap a rocker throws musical notes at
you just all kinds of weird enemies and
trippy backgrounds of cloud cities and
witches and it's just fun sounds great
it is if you got the hardware to play it
I've got the cartridge I can bring it up
next time or you can emulate it with
whatever if they sell it she's not the
real shit yeah the emulator or not that
the virtual where yeah I've got the
actual cartridges in the actual hardware
and the actual controllers and all that
it's excellent
just any asthma I mean almost all just
NES that's my favorite system so what's
your goal in this I took it through and
that died what is getting through
involved get to the end of the stage and
then I don't remember if you die what
isn't even a death apparently if you
fall into that pit - damn Oh
the subsequent levels aren't any less
terrifying and yes I'm richest fiancee
and yes and I'm genuine I'm not
artificial or Android my fiancee in the
real dull speculation that rich is
finding a way to talk over himself and
it's actually an alternate aspect of his
personality that's feminine but no you
know I read the man you know I'm not
that kind of voice awesome free rack of
monster party after Jack beats it for
the first time okay idea was
pre-recorded like Jack's supposed to
beat it and then show people pictures of
it no that's called pre-recorded because
it's previously recorded because it's
flexible we can do whatever basically
whatever the fuck we want
okay I'm sorry dude did you say Frick
yes oh yeah see this is like a game game
at about this number of remaining why
did definitely wanna yeah there's an
action engage I think you've got maybe
is some underwater parts oh my god it's
been so long since I've played this I
mean I did get through a fair amount of
it when I was really bored once but
press up and B bum
you see you hear this guys there's some
crazy shit that's happening here they're
saying they love each other and shit
kind of bullshit is that
oh okay they want us to hate each other
they want to hear blow it's more funny
if you fight if they think you're
fighting you don't actually have to
fight that just makes me a monster what
trying to make me look like a wife
beater no that was that was just the
manual there's no cheat
oh there's no nun of a nice of the word
like built challenging the problems the
building cheats no no I just read the
man you know I was seeing if there was
any story I don't think there is a story
I think it was originally an arcade game
and then it was ported I hope that the
arcade game wasn't so ridiculous so
maybe they just wanted it to eat
boarders but it just doesn't seem like
it has enough fun to hook you right yes
like after he was like $50 and quarters
just to get used to the controls
play something less stupid well this
game sucks quite you
it's a neat concept I mean when I when I
saw the box originally it was like oh
you know you get to play I love caves
you know I mean real caves it's like oh
yeah you can go and explore caves and
and dig rocks and geology but no we
might not be able to do it on the stream
because I don't know
well I'm talking literally stream it
that way but we're sure useful okay
you really don't look up the monster
party will know the enemies are really
fun blinky sounds like the game you
wanted to play with you Southwest which
is I'm assuming was the the Genesis for
somebody making spelunky yes yeah yeah I
like that one game you have with the
that schools and goblins but it's easier
and more fun than signing those really
well so give me your place where the it
was for I think it's for the cube would
work with a guy wouldn't when you do bad
he'd be running around it's boxers for
wine maximal yeah okay yeah so it's kind
of like it is to spelunky spelunker
spunky is the spelunker as Maximo most
of ghouls and goblins thanks much
Maximus to plenty hearts not as hard as
Costa combos so but okay well most
buggies on the 3ds monkeys do be vocal
minor Joe there's a gold miner Joe was
part of that whole big push of casual
games some years back what I don't know
why they didn't just port all of them
straight over to tablets because most of
them would work just fine
oh my gun is on fire in charge like all
the pop gaps it PopCap's games ought to
be available for the tablet
that's the greatest game over also you
live in 1984 they do live in a three I
don't know the year before Mario came
out first didn't get the money no no you
call him Mario could not fall that far
yeah
oh my god there's a ghost story Oh
started to have like ridiculous gravity
and stuff and there's no you felt
there's a bat shits on you yeah oh my
god the bats shitting on me yeah this
grotto is like acid acid or something oh
my god his acid shit this is the
greatest game ever
I think they should have made this game
99 ways to die I don't understand shit
I'm proud that my play isn't doing that
job I I don't know maybe maybe
brøderbund is Fang and break his brain
could have what
what is the spelunker I my brain is fine
I'm just you know what I'm doing
doing a retro classic title it's all
retro and shit the goal is really to get
goal or some gold or something doesn't
that make them like a gold miner or not
a spelunker oh well I think it's just
like getting I think just getting to the
end this here is your bullshit that died
just like do I go through all these
nooks to get the cool then just run
straight towards an exit where's an exit
how do you find an exit back go back the
way you came in I want the high score is
paper but you know what it'd be great
event with like a secret ending if you
go back off you win the game you know
the game is great huh elevator action
elevator action is that available
uncontrollably and we rarely mess marry
I don't know I've honestly never looked
into it or what
oh that's a good game yeah there's some
clones
Patera I can't imagine a game of
uncontrollable how do you why do you do
that for the touch it's an especially
responsive or what oh fuck I don't know
I downloaded it cuz it was a free app of
the day and I thought you might like it
but I didn't actually play every star
what's what's my opinion on Infinite
Crisis on secret Wars
I think Marvel is now making the exact
same mistakes that DC used to make yeah
goodbye goodbye Marvel I've been by
continuity I've always always loved
Marvel's tight continuity even though in
recent years it's kind of been eroded
away anyway but this is like final death
toll to Marvel I'm continuity so not
have matters anymore
yeah comics what I did
it doesn't matter anymore oh shit the
ghosts the ghosts shit shit shit this is
I mean spunky definitely came from this
game yeah and I love that proto spelunky
right I wasn't asked there's no picture
of my head there but I like saga non
superhero comics and trees oh yeah you
care my fianc waah my field swamp has as
we've we've switched places I will be
once in the comic books exactly we've
kind of we went to the comic book store
few weeks ago whenever that was and
normally like years ago used to be we'd
go to the comic store and she'd like
wait in the car or hang around and wait
for me to finish and then we'd go home
Emily what did the comic book store she
was browsing around the comic book store
I was just kind of waiting around for
her to be finished so we can go home so
you you have discovered comics recently
talked about well I've been reading saga
I've read all the current saga the first
24 issues
what is saga saga is it's a story a
story about a little boat that the
protagonist who is a kid the occasional
narrator is is this girl named hazel and
it's about her parents who are from
opposite sides of these two warring
planets planet a moon and she so she's
kind of like biracial or by species both
sides man children because they're busy
sides are at war their species like the
father is like a gold man or something
right
yeah well the people from the from the
moon or they have horns and the people
from the planet have Queens and so she
has horns and wings that's a little tiny
knobs why wouldn't you want that well it
because these people are in love know
what I'm saying like why wouldn't you
want to have both horns yeah
really frightened a tail towards wings
and a tail she's the ultimate weapon
series she doesn't have a tail I mean I
just in your mind she has a tail no I I
you said you know what more could you
want and I said well you know you can
want it you could want for a tail oh
yeah okay maybe for the whole set but uh
but yeah but but it's it's it's a great
really great story really great aliens
really great family dynamics and this
that and the other
J sounds like a girl yeah JJ had
hormonal e knowledge but they I'm not
Jack they want this little half-breed
may be dead or something
yeah both sides because she's like kind
of a symbol to them of people they want
everybody on this side hate everybody on
that side and least time got together
and so yeah she represents hope you
don't like home
yeah but not it's really as well it's
well-written it's it's for adults not
kids but doesn't mean it's not written
written enjoy well written by Brian cave
on the guy who did why the last man and
Fiona staples is it I think is the
artist yes I don't know oh yeah Fiona I
think it's Fiona staples I like that I
like trees not I mean yeah the things
that girl on the ground are all nice but
it's yeah it's well to cut a run in a
comic book that's currently running that
these things that these these large
columnar things city sauce city size
things just drop onto the planet and
they're there for years and they don't
communicate with the people and it's
just kind of
columnar it's yeah what's columnar their
columns they're they're they're
cylindrical she's really - you say words
she's vocabulary Asst yeah you say words
and I know they mean stuff and it makes
my head sorry yeah but but and then
these things start waking up and doing
stuff so it's I don't know exactly what
all they're gonna do yet because it 1/3
columnar is a real word column like
that's I think that's great I think you
learned something new every day just by
being around me I guess what I'm saying
is today's word word of the day was
brought to you by the letter e the word
columnar in the color yellow you make us
all smarter congratulations you're going
with a columnar and then the color is
just yellow not like teal or burgundy I
thought I was being generous I like
yellow our tiny brains can only handle
so much information rich I'm surprised
yellow color is chartreuse what else
have you been reading because I know
you've been reading other I read the
first issue of Squirrel Girl which was
awesome really cute she kind of runs
around singing the Spiderman song and I
like Miss Marvel the the the reboot yeah
the one with the teenage Pakistani
American I think she's Pakistani maybe
Iranian American she girl she has
different powers in this one all right
what's her powers um she can like shape
change like she can make herself good
bigger or smaller or her hands get
stretchy or whatever and she can also
heal herself but you can't do both at
the same time okay and it's it's I've
only read the first six issues I know
there are more but I've just read what's
the what's in the graphic novel and then
there's an issue up on Marvel unlimited
and are you are you more of a paper
comic reader or do you read on your II
device I'm more of an e device reader
what do you wanna have to use to read I
like comiXology what I do have I have a
subscription that I that I may end up
canceling to Marvel unlimited it's a
girl element it's really clunky to use
but I gotta finish reading all the hot
guys first and I read I like to read I
like the Marvel unlimited because I can
just read silly stuff that I otherwise
wouldn't ever really spend money on like
the lockjaw the pet Avengers and stuff
like that
sure and that in the Deadpool
Illustrated what was your reaction when
you started reading the the backstory to
Hawkeye and everything that has happened
the Hawkeye I I just I wanted to know
what a little bit about his backstory so
I just looked him up on Wikipedia and it
looks like he's died several times going
alive and or deaf and or possibly
paralyzed I really can't keep it
straight more than once and and and and
it's just crazy how many times they they
just kill these characters and put them
back together and yeah I mean puts what
I like about the Hawkeye stuff is that
he's not using superpowers he's just
this kind of a bumbling idiot at the
time who's in over his head he was
trying to take on like this Russian
mafia and he means well but I mean like
in every every every issue he's got more
bandages on and than the last issue and
he's got so many concussions he's
probably got brain damage that sounds
great
it does and it is it's not like and they
do a lot of creative silly stuff like
like one of the issues is told entirely
for the point of view of the dog it's
all but like these pictograms instead of
words but but yeah it looks like he's
had some he's had a rough life
he's been done by the past by by Marvel
and that resurrected so that they could
torture us more
I think it's great Batman 66 yeah I love
I love that I always liked the TV show
that this kind of sweet innocent a less
dark Batman I know people like their
dark Batman and you know it's probably
more realistic and gritty but sometimes
I just like something fun and
light-hearted where I know he's you know
he had up sir he had a rough childhood
but he's he's going on to turned into a
ass-kicking adult and and and just you
know save the world by bedtime or
something you know I I don't know why
anybody still lives in Gotham when it's
like the city of Townsville you know
like something bad happens every 4
seconds you think everybody would leave
the towel the one the one I know rate
must be staggering the one item point is
metropolis you could not pay me to live
in the front yeah Townsville metropolis
I mean people make lists of the most
dangerous cities to live in a house
filled metropolis of Gotham would have
to be on it if there were real cities
like do you think do you think like the
price of a condo in downtown metropolis
is like a hundred bucks
yeah like it's brand-new freshly built
it's expected built it's built like a
like a military-grade bomb ship 14
stories underground it's made out of
solid concrete like someone doesn't know
about the whole Superman thing like wow
I can't believe this whole building is
brand new such an old city why why is it
so new oh there are construction cranes
everywhere all the time
great city though if you're a
construction worker yeah triple overtime
yeah you gotta put the building's back
up the only hard part for them is the
commute because they don't live in the
city they know better yeah
scooby-doo Timo I know you read this
community oh I love the scooby-doo
team-up Scooby Doo Scooby doing bad man
scooby-doo and can you attack that no I
just jumped at Obie Scooby doing the
Flintstones the squirrel this could be
do in the Jetsons world it takes a lot
of little nods to Scooby stuff and
Flintstones stuff and it's just cute and
fun there's an episode where where the
where the Scarecrow comes in and kind of
takes out the humans and and and Scooby
in the bat-hound
take take over the whole issue and it's
just great he's the man home ace the
bat-hound it's cool to do save the day
he doesn't get many appearances these
days no no I I fully expect that shoot
what's his name what's Superman's dog's
name Krypto Krypto I I fully expect that
he thank you that he will show up in
there somewhere that there will be an
issue with Krypto and scooby-doo because
they've already had astro and scooby-doo
and ace the bat-hound and scooby-doo and
Dino and scooby-doo
you know if Krypto felt like humping
your leg there's nothing you could do
this you would have a hole in your leg
Jesus I mean you're right well I have
heard all kinds of things about like
what you know the logistics of what
would happen if if he even has Anatomy
remotely resembling a human although all
the ways he could kill Lois Lane first
time she says why does it have spikes
yeah what's that she's tiny goes my
penis and and she goes why does it have
pictures and he's like to grab you with
it's some kind of webcomic
friend of mine said it to me so I said
it to you but ya figure out this over
open ladder situation could work jack
good work do you notice how I'm making
it a little bit far yes I do I do
there's also a story as somebody sent me
where Superman Lois comes over to his
house and Superman this house is like a
hundred degrees and filled with rotted
meat because that's like how his species
is comfortable when he says he doesn't
even he's not attracted to human females
in fact he's not even sure he's the male
or female of his species
Custer says males and females I'd like
to see I think people really ought to
play play up the alien aspect have been
more often he's often he seems like he's
played off is like the the all-american
poster child for assimilation which
which can be all well and good but he's
also a freaky weird alien you wouldn't
you would probably have loved the Tim
Burton Superman that never got made yeah
I'm generally a fan of Tim Burton
there's an Edward Scissorhands comic
book out now what there is tell me when
there's a beetlejuice uh there might
have already been one for all I know I'd
have to look it up I would read that I
would totally read that I love
Beetlejuice both the cartoon from the
90s oh my god I remember uh-huh you ever
see the one with with where it's all
references to Edgar Allan Poe stories no
no it's good I've seen the power waiter
knows where everything was a reference
to the Beatles oh I haven't seen that
yeah
the supervillain team that called
themselves the beetles and just every
line in that episode they're working in
a beatles reference so well there's an
episode of The Jetsons word that's like
a Beatles reference and the way outs and
their heads are like yeah sleepies or
something doodle-do Sassoon yes pa never
played it might be good I'm just kidding
myself
I don't deserve that room I kept myself
too early
so what other nerdy thanks for talking
about I mean you've gone from from
Powerpuff Girls to comic books to sci-fi
shows you're covering the whole gamut I
think is great
what's the best traction I was here
isn't the best enterprise the first one
movie one of the TV show on the original
TV show really the best enterprise yeah
I guess I'm just the static for it ok I
gotta go with the movie one but why do
you say that I just it's it's exactly
like the TV show one only just much
nicer and better designed although they
have more money no sure but that I think
is the most beautiful enterprise you
need use the restrooms delete you any
longer the way I tell everybody
everybody poops
I have the ugliest Jack was the ugliest
average
oh fuck the ugliest enterprise cuz I
don't thinking about this lately because
I want to build that damn model there's
so much enterprises you know it's
probably enterprises enterprise then X
yeah I'm torn it's either the NX or it's
the fucking E I think everything about
me is just kind of disgusting what's the
e the next-gen movie ship oh sure
that thing looks like garbage how do you
get where the coast I have no idea I'm
gonna try to do this nobody so they um
I'm gonna try to run away it's the
ghosts just like a fuck you yeah they
got well the ghost comes after so many
minutes but so I'm gonna just like with
spunky I think I can like ya heard him
not ya heard him hey Arnie the Chet
someone in the chat thinks the sea is
the ugliest OC is up there alright just
has to die apparently how did I get down
here
I suppose you don't remember with a seat
look like one offhand someone from
yesterday's enterprise she was one it
was in one episode over what of Nixon
it was the time-travel one with Tasha
Yar she yeah she had that I'm alternate
timeline Tasha Yar ended up giving her
life at the admin go on the enterprise-c
to go back a time to die fighting the
Romulans so that there wouldn't be warm
equipment yeah yeah oh I remember that
design-wise it's like halfway between
the classic enterprise and the next-gen
enterprise it doesn't work and it
doesn't work you see
yes no that was the oh he was the one
from their next-gen movie stuff like
first contact on okay
are those nacelles and the weird
elongated primary hole it's just
disgusting you dim these cells
oh well girl would you get them nacelles
fight fight fight
justjust design-wise which ones I like
best this is the refit Enterprise flash
the enterprise aim then I might make the
see second I really liked the scene you
know I'm gonna throw this out there and
don't smack me across the mouth yeah but
I like that Voyager
Oh what did you like better the banner
prize in Millennium Falcon Andres
it's a fucking enterprise I mean the
fault gets cool but the enterprise is
the enterprise well you know what
they're cool in two very different ways
sure sure one one is a hot rod and one
is is a battleship you know if I could
only pick one to have as a detailed
model in my living room it would be the
animal and he Enterprises is sexy and
like in like a 50s modern kind of Eames
chair way oh well put Eames chair here
your references are so intelligent
they're throwing me for a get that one
what does that one like a furniture
designer like just think like when you
think like 50s modern like plastic
furniture modern looking chairs but when
I say moderate I mean like 50s
okay maybe 40s or 60s - I'm not sure
exactly what the timeline is
but the the refit /a the C the D the B
and then fucking Yi and the NX dead last
I don't know how do you feel about the
enterprise from enterprise
well it's supposed to be like
like a like proto Enterprise yeah you
know it's kind of stove a wagon
enterprise sure that doesn't mean it
looks good how do you feel about - it's
a fuck it's a it's a very functional
cobbled together early prototype kind of
a thing so I think it's fine for what it
is ok it isn't there for looks
it's the model a you know the tin Lizzie
it's a little primitive looking chats
asking which one the B is the B was
basically okay I'm drawn to him blink on
the name of the Excelsior the anti
Scalia except side down a Kura the
motorcycles
I get it I'm gonna here's here's my goal
take first Bellanca by the way I want to
beat this first level okay yeah I have
faith in you
I figured out what I have to do I have
to get all these keys band-aids or pills
they're flares
okay what's that thing that's going up
and down said a drill what things the
thing looks like a barber pen thing on
right under where you are yeah that's
that's my oxygen those are those are
oxygen tanks
yeah actually well if we're in a cave or
more or apparently very deep down is
there an extra meter I don't know does
that help no oh that's all I have
there is it's at the top you see where
says max and there's a purple arrow
that's crawling across the top is that
it I believe so real talk I have no idea
check your miss shake weight yeah that's
shaking shake weight you may think that
Enterprise B is hideous but then again I
do rank it just above the E and the NX
which are both humorous I mean real
battleships are pretty hideous too
I mean I don't think any any super
carrier ever won a beauty contest except
among their own aficionados fictional
universe ISM I'm obligated to yes to be
realistic expose movies do care more
about aesthetics
that fucking ghost I need to forego this
first treasure I think every I mean I
don't know window side oxygen meter is
the blue arrow
it's the blue arrow purple arrow purple
arrow 26 lanes wide NASA co2 26 tons and
four lanes wives American bride Cairo oh
I need to call mother fuck mother fuck
mother fuck mother fuck I'm just gonna
die what what don't I like about the
heat I don't I don't like the profile I
I don't like the elongated hole I think
the nacelles are gaudy and ugly
don't lay cells be drooping anything
about the eat all looks like crap yeah
uh-huh
word to your mother
the refit enterprise though that that
thing is sexy
almost sex is slightly sexier than Jack
Jack they hate this game so much they
want me to play pong what I hate this
game so much they want me to we used to
have the actual console my girl my uncle
gave it to us for so many of those I
think everyone had back in the day they
can't see how it could be is you for
more than 30 seconds
oh I guess you know when it came out it
was a novelty that you could make stuff
on the screen move what's what's the
best truck uniform the next-gen uniforms
from season three on yeah yeah when they
got rid of the onesie yeah yeah the
onesies are either either that or like
the Wrath of Khan era uniforms those are
pretty sweet but once them the reboot
thing aren't bad
on the new the new I'm not sure I like
the pattern part but but other than that
that that enterprise will rank just just
above to be I hate man that kind of
looks weird
I'm talking about the you yeah I know I
don't I think just maybe think about a
name cling to factor in that ship
Oh Abrams shit yeah oh yeah that was
pretty nice-looking yes yes you're gonna
lose your yeah limit you don't like the
replica no ii Abrams yeah that's okay he
goes any movie where Spock is yelling
and beating somebody to death too
crumbly you probably making a mistake is
most volcanoes I've ever seen geysers or
whatever they are one of the worst Star
Trek uniforms I mean the onesies from
Season one and two of next gen or pretty
awful yeah I know I kind of hate that
the dull-gray next-gen movie wants to
know sure
it's so bland yeah very there are two
like modern militaries yeah not enough
future militaristic not enough color
though the motion-picture uniforms
they're not even uniform it's like
everybody in that movie just they wear
whatever the fuck they want like Kirk
spends half the movie wearing it looks
like a tennis outfit oh fuck you
I'm doing this I'm fucking doing this
well we're talking about this don't
figure your life expectancy it's
probably a few more decades so you might
get there
that's bridge
not the original it's two days but this
morning probably the next job okay I'll
go with next-gen but that's I think the
original might be my second favorite I
think the bridge from the movies all
look bland yeah and then some of the
later next-gen ones like the next-gen
movie bridges and the Voyager bridges
they just look too cluttered
too busy mm-hmm about the Enterprise
bridge for moving it from this
enterprise show you know what I don't
even remember what that bridge look like
I'm gonna be honest with you
I think I fucked myself with that
elevator placement but we're gonna have
to go with it no oh okay miss the Rope
that's okay I explained this regular if
you like tweaked it so you've got more
like this no no there's no tweaking now
I was really that was just the manual is
right up there was no tweak the the
weird thing with the ropes and the
ladders is your guy automatically climbs
onto it so you actually have to like
stop hitting the button stop hitting the
direction button when he clings onto the
ladder really yeah that's weird it is oh
I don't think I can count that high what
he said is everybody counted how many
times jack is down since he started
playing this level look at one of those
little clicker counters look this game
is really hard oh it's balls aren't ya
I think I've gotten through life and it
was your spelling the first two two
maybe three that it was like fuck
science fiction I don't know a lot of
science fiction to go through where you
make that determination right rubber
rubber the rubber robot costume from the
day the earth stood still at the legs
it's past for being a classic movie that
gets passed fuck fuck god fucking fuck
did you meet me Karen you could make up
some kind of grin whoo amazing story do
that and nobody would know any time
through that yeah you were you were a
rock man I was parasite well oh there we
go I went in at McDonald's and I and I
was just a little girl and I ordered a
happy meal and they said well we're out
of boy toys and I said okay and they
said well we're out of girl toys too but
we've got this and I opened up my Happy
Meal and there was rich oh my god
you'd say my dick would start so I got
I'm gonna have email which was the toy
and some big Nuggets I mean kinda love
it
kind of love it
that's a week controller you could
probably spike him it wouldn't feel it
kind of what they said you're gonna
spike your controller in a minute
oh no I'm gonna I got this I got this I
got this I got you've been confirmed as
a girl toy like this I like the images
I've seen people posted on Facebook and
the internet and whatever I don't know
whatever those sites are where it's like
we're sorry we're out of boy toys
he abducted me from McDonald's when I
was a child
Oh
doing it and doing it and doing it huh I
represent Queen she was great oh come on
there's only one Jesus he's a super rare
type yeah oh is that nerd lover oh your
nerd love killed me
what is this Crowell was very
appropriate yes it was I'm sure nobody
got it someone in the chat got it it was
like blended the line between science
fiction and fantasy and the big powerful
weapon that the guy had to get through
defeat the bad guy was just like cloth
spinning thing that he could throw and
blades and go yeah yeah yeah and then at
the end the weapon didn't work but what
killed the bad guy was was his love it's
like dams all in distress it's like the
gate where he he like his sister gave
him the Maharajah and it's like the
symbol of her long she would send the
demons at least that movie had demons
and it was a kids movie and had her
opening to hell I would add some great
little like clay monsters and giant
smoking pit in the backyard and the
telephone melting and I enjoyed it yes I
know it's called the glaive but they
don't even know what the movie was
called right so if I just said the
glaive they just would have been
confused
it's true and we would have been I had
to describe it it was necessary
I've never heard of the glaive what's a
bad movie I secretly like the Conad
reboot I can actually appreciate as a
cone a movie
really yeah the cakes a bad movie that I
like
as children's one yeah
scooby-doo on Zombie Island there's a
bad movie that I love do you love the
Scooby Doo's yeah but most of the movies
are unwatchable even for me
hi guys don't worry don't worry don't
worry about it
don't worry about it at all neverending
story is a cute movie I mean it's a cute
buddy like everybody really a guilty
pleasure no it's a classic it's like The
Princess Bride yep not a neverending
story pleasured be more like lady heart
oh my god lady hawk
yeah everyone loves ladyhawk i don't
know what you're talking about how about
labyrinth you like leverage that's not
even a guilty pleasure no that's that's
great oh I know
I think I've seen it once and I was dark
the turn Christa is overrated that goes
hand in hand with labyrinth yeah
please describe the best movie ever
I mean it's a legal month oh yeah don't
you killed my father prepare to die and
it's so goofy but man you're you're into
it when he keeps saying that over and
over them and it's yeah yeah he's about
that he's about to die you think he's
been a penny but he just he holds on to
that phrase that is mantric he's keep
saying over again over again every time
you says it he gets a little bit
stronger I can't think of any movie
that's more quotable than that except
possibly Monty Python and the Holy Grail
oh yeah ghostbusters I told about my
coworker right about the first
cross-dimensional night around with
laser lights and I said don't cross the
street oh he goes what and I said
Ghostbusters he said I wasn't born and
I'm like you weren't born and go
toasters came out yes there's a lot of
people because we're all young when it
came out
47 or something I think I think my
favorite line in ghostbusters is I'm
terrified beyond the capacity for
rational thought my favorite glass
doesn't dump at my favorite line in
ghostbusters it's if somebody asks if
you're a god you say yes but it's yeah
it's in the top three most quotable
movies that Princess Bride and Monty
Python in the Holy Grail
next game please crying faces yeah yeah

this and you will shut the hell up how
about that we are prisoners
