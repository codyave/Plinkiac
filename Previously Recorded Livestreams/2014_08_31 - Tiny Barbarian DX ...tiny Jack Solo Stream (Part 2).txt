oh I gotta get whatever that is there's
always more secrets
chicken coinage
oh there's more chicken up there can I
still get that now fuck it do you feel
good I do that I do feel good and you
know I do want to oh my god this this
game just keep on going someone I think
a little bright here Oh]
no I'm sure Dark Souls it feels very
good to win and I am still interested in
general and playing I miss that chicken
time mr. chicken I'm still interested in
playing to ourselves it's just you know
no offense to you guys but you kinda
ruined it for me
no no not really it was just you know it
was definitely very tough playing while
streaming and your advice
oh fuck your advice was not the best
just putting that out there and I know
you know that and that's part of the fun
for you guys
but
I feel like of my life I feel like my
first time playing that game was not how
the developer intended it to be so I
will get back to Dark Souls chicken
prioritize chicken over coins any day
Jax one rule if I prioritize chicken of
the coins
and over coins 2014 10 points but if
there is no chicken then get all the
coins you can
oh my god
we're getting slightly murder rated
oh come on I just want to make it I want
to make it past the level where I can
pause it now look that's all I want to
do and the game is not giving um hey
sigh yeah oh I saw ya couldn't do
nothing about it
okay okay okay
I feel like I feel like Dark Souls
that's a video game here's a really
nitpicky thing about Dark Souls is I was
not a huge fan of their checkpoints I
felt like it like if you had you had to
defeat Dark Souls in in one life with no
checkpoints like you know always there
from the beginning I wasn't a huge fan
of how you like a leveled off and then I
also have no idea what I'm talking about
because I did not do very well with when
I play Dark Souls so don't listen any of
my criticisms to the large
as someone who enjoys really hard games
almost felt like Dark Souls wasn't hard
enough what
a real thing that I just said didn't get
that coin
come here elf
hey chicken can we check pause we gotta
take a break
hmm we gotta take a break my thumbs are
a little sore okay I'm gonna run a
commercial we are gonna take a little
break
hold on hold on we're gonna what we're
gonna put up this little doohickey it's
a great one we're gonna take a little
break just because I need a little break
and we'll be right back
you
okay y'all we are back we are back let's
take a little break I just had to walk
away from the game for a one hot second
because this level's it's getting a
little tough this is getting a little
tough a farm what
oh I see you just noticed the y'all I'd
I say y'all a lot new snack oh um I do
say y'all I have family in Texas
in Texas that's a normal thing to say oh

nice and I know you're there now yeah I
know you're there and I know I jumped
into yours
so I'm gonna jump to something you don't
got a jump such is the way of the tiny
barbarian
and also it's like really hoping that
tiny barbarian lived in the normal sized
world and he actually just was tiny but
apparently it's just pixel found because
everything seems to be tiny
oh my god there's gold now I almost
wanna die to get that gold yo you know
everything
tiny barbarian is tagging and everything
is tiny and that's not a world I want to
live it I was hoping he'd be fighting
like giant things because he's dying
the answer is in yep
jump over all the things such as the way
of time
fuck well that night no go get more
coins others against drunk gaming that's
not a real thing if there was no drunk
gaming there wouldn't be a lot of gaming
okay

guy we also done Oh what
inconsistent firing rates
remember where the secret is over here
somewhere

bad force
if you like I feel like we have not even
delved into the story of tiny barbarian
yes if there is such a thing as a story
in tiny barbarian
and there's not I know there's not a
story I mean because they have told us
any story yet but I feel like at this
point we should have gotten some sort of
you know even if it's just saving the
princess or or some other video game
bullshit we haven't gotten anything
chicken woof I see it check out all
that's my favorite kind of all it's a
wall with chicken in it
back yd is shaved for rlm but let your
hair beard grow up for Vsauce its I get
that a lot
yes I know I look exactly like Michael
Michael from Vsauce
I get that I get that weight of it is
like okay I just can't hurt there which
I accept I absolutely accept then just
like
okay and so I guess what I'm saying is I
yeah I think that's funny
Oh chicken dinner you know that makes me
a winner winner because she got his
family never say stuff like that when I
want a chicken dinner
mine did all the time
get out here
Jesus Christ

ridiculous with this game sir things are
happening now chicken well the chicken

chicken ball y'all I can feel my snake
killed by a snake well I was I was
reading the chat oh I'm we think our
second meeting today Jack Hill sits out
chickens for dinner oh my god it's true
I did
yes beyond infinite Robin Williams
World's Greatest Dad
directed by Bobcat Goldthwait I have not
seen it J loves that movie
I've heard great great things answer the
cigarette question is there a cigarette
question I've heard really great things
about world's greatest dad I don't know
if I'm ready to see it yet I'll tell you
what's the question you know what you
tell me what the question is I'll tell
you whether or not I want to answer it
oh yes sir Thank You Otto J no none of
us smoke cigarettes smoking cigarettes
is one of the dumbest things you could
ever do I used to smoke I smoke you know
what that's gonna get me started into a
story so I will start blanket I smoked
ran ran right on high school for a
little bit like I want that chicken cuz
I know it's there I know that chicken is
bad smoking is just the dumbest thing in
the world it offers no it offers you no
real benefit you know because you're
addicted to the nicotine nicotine is
such a paltry hi
you know like I understand drinking and
drugs like I understand the appeals that
because of the high that you get but
there is none other cigarettes where
it's so weak compared to other drugs and
it's just like do other drugs just
possibly the worst advice I could ever
give to anyone it's to other drugs but
uh but you get it here I am giving that
advice
I think smoking and I used this one if I
was I'd take for a good year and a half
I was a oh my god
pack-a-day smoker Lucky Strikes filter
Lucky Strikes like a shrink it means
it's toasted my brand
okay it's toast
I'm gonna get to do how the drugs jack
right no you know it's like I can like
get out of drugs the other drugs make
sense as to why people do them but
nicotine is so weak by comparison where
it just does not make sense you know
there there's no nothing good comes out
of cigarettes is stinky and the high is
incredibly not worth the cost as far as
I'm concerned it's always a cost-benefit
analysis right but the nicotine buzz
they get is not work it's not worth how
expensive cigarettes are not awful you
smell and you know you lose your taste
buds it did it it boggles my mind that I
ever was a small parent
fuck you snake but you know that's
that's how you gonna do it sometimes
you're young you don't know any better
that's the whole thing just gonna tread
barrel because you're young and other
people smoking you think smoking is cool
cuz it's the man doesn't want to do
right which I mean my age I don't know I
don't know can you still I don't know
smoking still like a big thing it was
definitely you know like for my
generation you know Tarantino is just
getting big and all the people smoking
tank and movies and so it was just oh
yeah it's be cool crack is whack the
drugs drugs are okay as long as the
highs worth the price right that's the
that's the real thing is the high work
price now just monetary not just
monetarily but also socially you know
like crack I'm sure the highest grade
and the price is very reasonable but you
know you can go around and be a crack
party
I don't think I don't know I'm also not
a crack head so it's not my not my bag
crack is not a socially acceptable
so so you know there's a price not only
with the cost of crack but also with the
but also you know we're hangin how will
the jack 30 yes
32
yes well I say I say yes they're not 32
and at my age
I just I feel very practically about
drugs and I've done I've done some drugs
so
I have the data to back up my my
theories
snake I'm also just feeling it I'm
failing
Lucky Strike it's toasted
that's okay if you're a little someone
have asking the question who's a better
director J or Mike neater I'm sure
they're both fine it's tough because I'm
their friend like whenever I have to act
in anything of theirs they give me
almost no Direction just because I I
know this dick but sometimes I'll ask
for direction neither of them are quite
good at
either them are quite good at directing
me but I just think that's because I'm
up French both Codell stories I don't
want Kroger domains so I don't know if I
have any stories to tell you
madmen reference neither of them are
quite good no any Knights directing is
hard directing is a very hard thing and
I think I don't know if it's like
first-day stuff I don't know if they if
they are having a dual director role or
if it's directed by Mike usually Mike
takes on more of the directing and Jay
takes on more of the cinematography so
that I know just in general I don't know
if that's true perspective apprentice
please I don't know if that's true for
space-time but let's assume it is
because
chicken yes chicken just when you need
an entire wall chicken Thank You game
Thank You game for knowing when I need
chicken where does our
dr. go
Oh drug stories uh you know I did some I
don't have any like particularly like
drug your story
I don't let's see if I have anything
good you know
I don't remember to wear like cotton
balls today because I did lots of drugs
you know right out of high school I
would have a definitely smoke bomb with
my friends and eventually I stopped
smoking but because I got really
paranoid like dangerously paranoid to
the point where I wouldn't leave my room
I would I would stay in my room and play
metal gear solid all day which by the
way did not help my pair you know I
would just get so any sealer living the
best way to describe it and at that time
I was sharing a house with some guys and
I had the basement room
both Paul - fucking christ that was
awesome I did
oh hey so what would happen was my
friends would start getting high and one
of them with detective might come down
and bring the drugs to me because I
wouldn't go upstairs because drug
reasons it wasn't an everyday thing like
I still have a job you know like I went
to work but that's it that's what I
would do I would just go to work and and
come home go right down to my room and
wait to draw just to come okay so you
know not a bad life I say but I stopped
because
because I've just got to parent our nose
that having fun anymore
and haven't done it since it's been a
long time since I've done any sort of
drug yeah that's the thing like it just
made me anxious and it made me it maybe
not I don't know
you know what fun it was fun like when I
was a knife thrower let's see here you
know like good drug stories I don't know
if I have any I I can tell you one time
if anyone has ever done drugs you have
probably hung out at your drug dealers
house for a little bit which we used to
do you know like he was our drug dealer
I wouldn't necessarily call Mr lorry end
but you know we hung out a lot mostly
because it was their drug dealer at one
time
one time while at his house
this got a secret
I forgot all the way back
one time while hanging out at his house
can't okay I guess
there was a rather
there was a rather attractive lady there
and I was commenting to a couple other
people you know not attractive this lady
was and they were all giggling because
you know I don't know why cuz I was
lying I didn't get one everything there
was gay and so I was encouraging my drug
dealer friend to angel came to introduce
me to the lady and he's starting to get
going a lot too and they're like they
were encouraging me to go pick her up I
was like oh you gotta you gotta you
gotta do your thing and I I'm no good
any of that sort of thing so you know
like I started I said chatting her up
doing two enough things doing the
business that's what I call it which is
why
never did except for my wife
and this this lady started giggling -
and you know you know your moves are
working when the lady is gay as it turns
out this lady was a guy we just dressed
very androgynous Lee and so he took it
as a compliment
that I thought he was awaiting that that
means that his outfit was working I did
not find it so amusing as I was you know
dude
and hitting on dudes ain't my thing so
of course all my friends knew this guy
and knew I was hitting out of you the
entire time said nothing
friends that's a good story
hey you know I don't know like he was an
androgynous dude
and so I don't know if I would have
known bad I don't know if I would have
been known that he was a lady or was not
a lady but kids don't do drugs you laid
on dudes no he wasn't them like he
wasn't a UH like a transgender he was
just he just liked dressing feminine you
know like we call that a transvestite I
don't know I don't know what the correct
term for any of this is but it was a
funny story I had I've read and run into
him a couple times after that and you
know he would always get a kick out of
that eventually one day I saw him like
one day I was hanging out with him and I
saw like he must have not done his
makeup well that day or something but I
saw like how masculine I saw his
masculine features and I was like how
did I
that was a lady but I did fuck off
here we go yeah
I see here I have really fond memories
of listening to New York I think we
talked about be or feel on the last ring
airplane pause for our flame taking I
was taking a car ride to like this cabin
I can help get up there on a car ride -
it's like cabin up in the woods and I
never heard Bjork before that and man
pot makes music better which again it's
a terrible thing to say
look lychee snake I saved you
I saved you from an eternity of touching
us you're welcome snake Oh
so their first child a mascot thank you
so you know driving for several hours
listening to York while getting getting
high and dude we got high and snorted
ritalin I want to say that was the thing
I don't know if that's a thing people do
but that's what we did does you know we
were young ago and that that was some
good times just listening to the arc and
zoning out still really enjoyed York
thank you know how I enjoy that BR she
is one classy lady
this guy's great
Oh
yes yes this now
Thanks Thanks
you know I don't I'm sorry if I don't
have any good stories for you it's the
only way to enjoy Bjork no I still enjoy
York
oh crap bull crap and see that now oh I
see I see what's going on here
get up here a little bit well fine fuck
I still enjoyed yoga I think I think
she's fine I enjoy her music and do the
things that come out of her crazy mouth
oh oh you can hit it back that would
have been good to know
Kirk is amazing I believe that and
absolutely like that I've never seen
your own flat side did you want some of
that I mean you know no but real good
drums were just like I said eventually
eventually it was just me hanging out in
a room by myself which is no which is no
way to live in case you didn't know that
already
like I mean I can tell you the story of
when my good friend punched me in the
face that may be like that there was a
there's a transgression between a friend
and I have some unspoken trust was
spoken unspoken trust was broken between
a friend tonight there we go coinage and
one day while doing drugs we decided
that we needed to settle we need to
settle the score because we were gonna
hang out no matter what and so we did a
super smart thing and we decided to get
really high and have him punch me square
in the face because then you know like
it would be even I can I transgressed
over the unspoken rule and and he would
punch me in the face and so we wrapped
his hand in a t-shirt
he'd punched me square in the face
and the only the only negative side to
that is don't know if you've ever been
punched in the face but you know it
hurts we're gonna get that chicken no I
don't need the chicken actually and
apparently if you are on drugs you pass
out if someone punches you in the face
which is something neither of us knew so
it scared the living crap out of him
look at baby Beth
yes I'll have to do this is a real
English boss fight ever
okay
oh my god
because there's a baby here
nice
and I give this lady
boom the home gotcha ladies sorceress
if you're nothing to me
as his this feels final boss ish I don't
know what the final boss in this game it
but this feels like it did
oh Jesus Christ so many in case my
friend punch me in the face and I passed
out for a good long time but now we're
even so we got that going for us
how
Jesus Christ
as lady Vance
your lady pants don't have any power
here yeah
oh come on
Jesus I felt like I did better that time
Jack's life is a richard linklater when
we write when will our Ellen make
another appearance at no brand gun
perhaps when space got the Sun I think
that's what that's Jay's official answer
is they will start making appearances at
conventions once a space cop has done so
you know two or three years
55 days five years yes
yeah
Hey
boom that should do extra damage when
I'm knock her into the spikes mostly
because it's awesome when I eat it
yeah
it's fucking snake speaking of drugs
right conventions no I am you know I
have nothing against drugs I just don't
do them anymore except for beer and
coffee
dear toffee which are both drugs great
drugs wouldn't be redundant Vantage of
anymore
lady
hey shake
gotcha I took I took too many likes to
do that just you know what's buggin
should we send our drugs now don't send
us drugs we don't do drugs
send your interesting microbrews to the
red letter media pls that's all we do
anymore
I can't I can tell you that from a from
a creators point of view the time that I
was on drugs was the time I got the
absolute least accomplished that means
anything to anyone
I I created almost nothing when when I
was on the drugs
and I collect your pretty package
oh come on I got you
yeah
fuck snake
what about I was a pound bomb right dr.
J dr. J says when you smoke at the
studio you either get nothing done or
write an entire album it's it's one of
those things where I you know it wasn't
me
that's what I that's what I really found
was I was just not the kind to do it
and so into stuff and I found that I got
a lot more accomplished
that's the moral of the story see what
works for you
see what works for you you know if it
works for you that you're doing to you
and it doesn't then don't do it
