take the shotgun guy from behind tell
you what I'm taking about some time
no specialist nurse
hostile
this is neat like authorizing psycho
did it fuck yeah
you walk out alright alright Chad who
whoever him with a zoo Samantha Steve or
Cletus
this game is $12.99 Jack what's up jack
jack is not typing in the chat
say 1% - for hey-zeus and - for steve up
there's a third phrases for nowadays
oohs this hips don't lie
Jack Jack what do you think about those
games looks looks right up your alley
all right
note to self I cannot trip those guys
I'm spat
some people I get that out of you
you know you know I don't I don't stick
or talk during cutscenes i'm highly
enjoying because it better if you got
available if I can't surely oh fuck
Jack this is a 2d cover based shooter
like I am I'm popping in and out of
cover there that's okay I don't I don't
know that I'm in love with it but it's
fun it's that great sense of humor which
you would miss skipping all of the
cutscenes
all right find the gerbil ooh less than
100 shots I'm already halfway there
that's not good probably not going to
pull that one off and I'm
I see the Rising Sun does not like the
game sense of humor well I I do I have
laughed out loud several times not
really chest high walls Jack more like
ducking behind the cabinets it's more
like ducking in alcoves
like when you're grayed out you're in
cover like there's some kind of thing in
the wall so you can straight out
so now I gotta find a gerbil and the
reporter it's the wrong one get back up
my trap down here
oh well
oh well
all right I like the cat bomb
quite wisely
I think I'm rushing too much in this
game works a bit better one here a
little bit more tactical about what
you're doing
turn up
I missed I missed one I missed one
talk about the movie contact I I don't
even remember contact it's been so long
since I've seen contact it's a movie
there you go there's my discussion of
contact I hope you enjoyed this
discussion of contact it's a movie
starring Jodie Foster and some other
people based on a book by Carl Sagan
that's the only interesting thing I
could say which everyone knows already
so there's no point in my saying it oh
there's the Tribble hazers needs that
gerbil
what can I knock it back up I might be
unable to get back up
I don't think there is
rich how the fuck are you I'm just fine
all right I am something is missing I am
lost I did something wrong
something I don't know what I am unable
to go back up where I likely need to go
and things are generally fucked Jen
really fucked check it in this door
not over here Green Street right a Buffy
there's nothing right above me I know
I've probably moved
oh I think I see no it's green but
there's no there's no explosive option
all right Runa B says I I I like to
think I know a lot about games but
previously recorded live manages to play
games I've never heard of new hipster
fucks I'm not sure if that's a
compliment we try we try to play I can't
take you jack
sure he feels the same way I try to play
a decent number of different things
though I'm going to continue to play a
lot of dead rising because I liked dead
rising I'm gonna I'm gonna start playing
the second one at some point
no Phoenix I have not seen one spike so
far
spike free spike free unless this is my
gun there's a lot of strange power-ups
like there was a cat bomb I love the cat
bomb alright I'm just restarting let's
fuck it
you're outnumbered
you know what Jesus Christ for changing
characters this might be a job for
Cletus Lee the fire a limited number of
shots and when I inevitably play Dead
Rising 2
you're not gonna be in Odessa
where are these reporters that spoke
nails evidence
Oh
these Cornish where are the reporters
okay
I just
this this mission is totally a job
please
where are the reporters I want to meet
them stop right there oh the TV's come
it's a weird
what's the snob bridge from stealing in
a YouTube video of someone else doing a
no death run and talking over it like
he's pulling it off himself that's just
mean I wouldn't do that I like doing no
death runs in games you've seen me
stream a number of different failed ones
and you know you can you can probably
find the original online you can
probably find that and call me out let's
do this
nice
well duh
you've lost the wrong house
anybody who looks there's the reporters
all right now we know where the
reporters are I can go find them now
when did I start doing no death runs for
video games many years ago like a decade
ago just the way to games I absolutely
loved it was a way to give them a little
extra bit of challenge no wait I might
not be able to back up so
raise that
nope and I'm dead I'm dead are there any
actual games that might place no I I
haven't seen Mike play a game since
shitload of years ago I know I used to
like one of the the Star Trek flight
Sims I forgot which one it was
don't clean Academy bet he flies ships
did he like flying around the ships and
you did that for like a week he's the
only game I ever saw him play and that
was it for my kid games
time to get your lack they robbed a mom
yeah I don't know I don't know that
co-op really comes it's something he
played during the stream that once
they're less
what's the wrong house ma'am
Challenge gone
Oh
fail to meet those reporters again every
time this game is starting to get to
appropriately difficult which I like
now we're gonna try run without trying
to get any of the objective
got everything wisely
yeah that felt good don't mind if I do
nice babbling oh fuck
ice cubes not bad this game is growing
on me let's do this
you don't get that time
I'm doing my own oh I fucked up
which what's the first game you
completed a no death row for Maximo goes
to glory I'm gonna marry second one was
probably zone of the enders of time then
it would have been a ninja ninja gaiden
dumb one from Ninja Gaiden 2 9 did you
guys enjoy me knob Maximo - never been
able to pull one off for Ninja Gaiden -
I've never been able to pull one off for
vanquish try it a number of times with
both of those games
here we go
and you've all you've all seen me
pulling off for Dead Rising I don't
remember if I've done one for Dead
Rising 2
oh no I wanted to keep it made shopping
oh my god dammit
you might watch the fuck out of a
vanquish no death from but I don't think
I get pull it off I've never I've never
done it twice
jack is out of town
fuck hey some do oh my god
take care come lose my adipose might
well begs to us Steve for a bitter red
repo
Oh
and Canada Jim here they all want to
know when you're coming back
thank you Mike they all want to know
all right don't look mishaps don't allow
your not come back the hey Zeus oh we
can shoot and slide didn't let us say
I don't like those exploding bullets on
him that doesn't work out so well
let's pray came from no way back out all
right
kind of bad
I found the reporters
motherfu
right alright wait
I think that last time there was some
kind of
all right all right you did it it did it
in the funny wagon
how about
I'm trying to bounce this name cynic no
cynic douche Oh nein thank you for
subscribing we really appreciate it
it's growing really no five most alone
what am I wear my feelings on
regenerating home for the most part I
tend not to like it I don't like ducking
behind cover to heal I also games in
regenerating health usually means you
die quick when it comes to shooters I am
decidedly old-school
we'll try and unlock one more chair of
your
quarterly fabulous
you wouldn't know
right
allow me
this is bad
where we the hostages are time
that don't do good for the hostages
finding a lot of milkshakes though so
win
you would have timeless
I'm the one
they might be our god they say such
silly things
I am I
here you go we're doing the Sun
nope
I'm on there y'all record your faces
everywhere
Fiona Belmont say they should make a
game where you just clean up after
bloody action singing it's not really
action scene massacres but go online
well you're obviously online now open up
Google look up viscera cleanup detail
and there you go
all right
or do you walk out st. Helens
born-and-bred will try Mike out
oh he's got double-barreling three shots
oh my god thank you good thank you right
go vision complete
oh shit too far too far alright now this
one again and after this stage I think
I'm gonna take a break what do you guys
what are you guys thinking of this game
quality
who does that shoot through cover all
right that shoots through cover that
changes the game
now
ever power up he gets it's only gonna
have two shots no not again oh fuck fuck
I can't compare this game to grow fours
or does I've never actually played
broforce so if you're saying it's
similar I'm gonna have to take your word
for it
seems like a choose their cover oh
that's okay next make some kind of nice
alright be careful with this - cuz that
just goes all over the fucking place
please maintain some little add nope
there's no order land
right now that does not shoot through
cover for shame was here tonight he's
got a night I wonder if I can do
close-range kills
people
okay the knife is for this this Brown
takedowns I get it
all right we're getting it I'm getting
it it's making sense
it's not my favorite game ever that's
kind of neat
yeah I'm gonna be honest we it's not an
elevator action in the chat if I had to
compare the two actually like elevator
action more not this bad but elevator
action is pretty fun oh shit
give us a live look chat it's I don't
know what's going on with them but it's
best just to ignore them
far best just to ignore
