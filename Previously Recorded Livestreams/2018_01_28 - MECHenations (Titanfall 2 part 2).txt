buying games from business expense
normally wait for the game to be a few
months be out for a few months or to you
buy when it first comes out it depends
upon the game and whether or not I feel
like I want to wait the plan yep
like XCOM 2 came out immediate immediate
purchase right it depends upon the
anticipation well and I've definitely
like I'm definitely I feel like a little
looser than your than your average
person when it comes to buying games
because yeah if we can get a stream out
of it boom
our Arkham Knight you know even if we
weren't doing a review despite my
reservations about the Batmobile yeah I
knew that was gonna be crap I that would
have been out of day one regardless do
you think yeah I like the other games
too much
the hell are they building here bTW
it's gonna happen
shit
but people wanted to drive the Batmobile
which I'm talking about myself and I was
very unexpected
I never wanted to drive the Batmobile
and that this is just me right I was
apprehensive about the Phantom deal
before I cannot because I was you know I
turned out to be totally justified I was
worried that half the game would be
driving shit and it was more than half
and turned out like the best use of the
Batmobile
the first Arkham game Batman drove the
car to where he was going at the
beginning of the game that is how you
utilize the Batmobile yeah
so I wasn't one of those people who's
okay where do you what can't we use the
Batmobile in Arkham good I was never one
of them
then it saved his ass from Bane yeah in
that that that's like one percent of the
game it had happened in a cutscene once
again the appropriate use of the
Batmobile in a Batman game
I'm with you I'm with you turned it
turned into too much of a thing yeah
Batmobile should be a situational device
and that our Batman spends 95% of his
time fucking around with the Batmobile
right
oh that's neat oh he also needed to get
something out of the trunk in Arkham
Asylum
once again appropriate to the Batmobile
oh there you go
okay I don't think we're on that way
wait for the next one wait for the next
one but a first-person Batman game work
probably not
probably mad
I think with a lot of well-established
characters you want to see the character
I think by and large well also I think
it's really appropriate to have the bulk
of bet man be about hand-to-hand combat
sure and doing that in first-person
perspective would be laborious it would
not work as well they would not work as
well
60 Batman can't be noir game wears them
that they really if they really wanted
to change it up know what they do an
Adam West style Arkin game like we've
done this Arkham thing three times four
times how do we how do we change it up
you go full camp you can't get Adam West
to do the voice anymore
but can you imagine Adam West style
Batman Arkham game that would be a lot
of fun oh yeah that would be a lot of
fun you it would still be you know like
stealth and oh yeah
fighting but it's in the style of Adam
West yeah I loves all stuff like old
chum and oh you know what would be a
gameplay mechanic huh
death traps like the death traps I had
on that show escaping from the death
trap
yes you're about to be impaled by
swordfish you're tied up yes
the heck is that God oh that just
vaporizes people that's great any more
bullets though
all of the stealth takedowns they ended
up owls yes you you stayed up behind
them and then you Batman spins up around
and then you get the flash on the
uppercut with the the sound effect that
everything do do I agree
either the stealth takedowns or that's
like you know how when you get the combo
meter you can do the takedown boom yes
that's the power once you build the
combo meter up you do the instant
takedown which is the power I'm so down
for this I'm so very very down for this
with the idle animation be the bentusi
should be a grapple mechanic so you walk
up the side of the building Cape is like
hanging down towards the building the
camera light goes on its side that's let
you climb yes right what who what damn
it
Robin is player - you could have it
could be a two-player yeah yeah be AI
partner most of the time you'd have to
have Robin and the the de can't be
Batman game oh yeah
either co-op or AI Robin
shit
can we get a workout tape with Bane how
would you do Beynon like a sixties style
because he'd have to have the campy
friendly version of vane right that's
nowhere near as threatening he oh you
get he's like a pro wrestler yeah he's
oh he's a luchador a he's ever Bain
yeah he's elven that's who it is his
henchmen I'll have the luchador mask
yeah yeah well and he wants he just
wants to steal something he doesn't want
to break the Batman's back it's steel
well that's what they are
just el2 something-or-other
you know
steal the wrestling belt he deserves oh
the gold the diamond-encrusted wrestling
belt well old chum
it's a shame we'll never make this they
will never make this by the way
motherfucker but uh yeah this is this is
that's a really fun idea this is a
really fun idea there would be there'd
be a lot more like walking around in
puzzle solving I almost wonder if you
could do a little bit of it like um
almost like an adventure game where you
need to like collect items and you know
solve mysteries because I think I feel
like that was a lot of old Batman or a
60s Batman I don't know no I'm just
thinking that you keep a lot of what was
still there in the Arkham games and this
would make it fresh yeah I don't
and yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't need
to add something just for the sake of
advancing yourself
if everyone could have a magnifying
glass tech division is just a magnifying
glass yes
why is it not happening already I love
it
I would absolutely want the Batmobile in
that version oh you know fair point
there has to be a sequence where you
have to go through like the shark tank
and that's where the upgrade you get the
new item you get is the bat shark
repellent the gadgets would all be silly
oh of course and wonderful silly and
wonderful the bat boat shoes across the
water the bad shoes yeah you could do it
maybe a little Metroidvania style where
you know you pick up the boat shoes and
you can go back to the earlier level no
now you can walk across the water old
chum
people talking
it's just too bad I don't Wes can no
longer force this I know I know you know
you get you get some other you know you
get your will arnett or some other
interesting voice who can do a
half-decent adam west impression how do
you do to face from the sixty style well
your character model instead of looking
like his face is bert it has to look
like half of his face is just like badly
done makeup it's bright green right with
some wavy lines and grease paint yes all
of these things yes
that was a dumb idea
cheddar did the 60s to face alright yes
we did of the animated cartoons I
haven't I haven't watched them they did
a oh they did a six easy Adam West 60
style cartoon where William Shatner
played two-face
oh yeah good choice good choice yes
they did that for the new fat man
returned the Caped Crusader's that's
that's exactly what I'm talking about
somebody brought that up in the chat I
might not have vocalized that well
enough they did a cartoon where William
Shatner before his two-face put Adam
West a fat man 60 style
that sounds delightful
now a blood chant says I'm disappointed
there was no fuck you it's January video
this year and the rest of what you say
is a spoiler for the new half in the bag
so I will not read it thank you Oh
MC Lucas says just watch the latest half
in the bag what the fuck is wrong with
you guys
keep up the fantastic work dudes you
like that you know have fun nothing fun
just have holes just having a little bit
of a good time that's a neat gun so if
you're gonna have Rochelle ghoul
he wasn't invented yet so he couldn't
appear in the sixties show okay who
would play Rochelle cool about it right
now at the time at the time I have my
choice and it's brilliant
at the time at the time in 66 who would
have played Rachele cool Ra's al Ghul
nobody knows how to pronounce it for
sure I'm trying to think of who was
alive in 66 all right you know I'd blow
your mind yeah
Ricardo Montalban not bad not bad
Ricardo Montalban gets a gets a whole
load of not bad rich how do you feel
about Ricky Ricardo how do you feel
about that I don't know
I like Ricardo Montalban better yeah no
Ricardo Montalban works but Desi Arnaz
not the worst choice
barely it was a meat grinder you okay
I'm damaged however I do not believe
this is a food processing plant
my left this place is going to turn
itself inside
Vincent Price I don't know if that's
Roger like Raja al Ghul has a certain
like grace and dignity and I'm not
saying Vince Bryan doesn't have that
have that but he has his own Vincent
Price has his own creepy weirdo thing
yeah the red hood the red 60 style James
Dean James Dean is the red hood
I like it
James Dean was dead in 66 a shoot I
thought I thought maybe I'd sneak in
there at the border this is a neat
sequence right here when did when did
James Dean died what year was it you
don't Jeff do you know what year was
specifically was it fifties look at this
we're not like a house but we're
sideways sort of to like climb up the
furniture and shit yeah that's neat
57 okay that's considerably off 5755
according to google
this is blowing my mind a little bit
they never did do scarecrow Oh Sees
scarecrow could go to Vincent Price he
was egghead he was on the 60 show
someone else was he yes shit Vincent
Price one of him a choice but he's taken
I don't know which way is up and for his
Dracula cred Christopher Lee maybe that
was he not Dracula into the 70s with a
hammer movies
Anthony Perkins a scarecrow oh I like it
I like Anthony Perkins a scarecrow
Anthony Perkins I'm drawing psycho
Norman Bates up khun's Perkins yeah
Norman Bates so when you said psycho for
some reason first of all that's great
casting but when you said psycho for
some reason my mind clicked to Silence
of the Lambs yeah I was like oh wait is
it a little too old but
all right your des ian has inspired me
yeah
Lucille Ball Harley Quinn yes
this is weird this is sufficiently weird
and I dig it
loading scenario 1 to 7 in dynamic
simulation dome 3 1 4 yes I know I know
Harley didn't exist in 66 but neither
did Rochelle ghoul we're just having a
little having a little fun yes
what the what
what
delivering militia test subjects
scenario one to seven
loadcomplete what
I don't know I haven't been playing the
game
Sean Connery is Ra's al Ghul how's that
terrible
so why are the manufacturing of fake
clearly fake that's a great question
deploying additional replay to test a
scenario I don't exactly know ship
I can tell you I'm slightly getting my
ass handed to me
Humphrey Bogart is Batman Humphrey
Bogart as the question oh yes she's my
hero cameos in there
Malcolm McDowell is the Mad Hatter is
inspired
he actually did the voice on the
animated series did Nikki know was he
dead matter which ones me who's Malcolm
McDowell Rida McCall not Malcolm
McDowell riding McDonald riding McDonald
did he say Malcolm and I he said Malcolm
and I read that as my brain that I
interpret that is rotting I thought he
was talking about riding McDowell no
riding McDowell as the Mad Hatter okay
who's riding me about Fright Night he
played the the vampire hunter TV guy he
was one of the apes in Planet of the
Apes done a bunch of things he was in
shock mom yes okay now now you're
speaking my language shock MA Roddy died
in the 90s but did he did he voice the
Mad Hatter before he died that voice
fits
but anyway he would have been great for
the Mad Hatter on the 60 show yes
Roddy McDowall absolutely I'm with you
right a McDonald's on the 60 show as
book bomb okay cities out
Malcolm MacDonald would make a decent
mathematics you given up not Batman 66
style we need we need the camp yeah you
need the camp
what about Hugo Strange Phil Silvers so
many old people how do you know so many
old people I didn't know so many rebury
reruns honestly
you know all the old Gregory pecks got
to be in there somewhere
no no you know what Gregory Peck is your
cameo as Clark Kent Superman
either that or Harvey Bullock I would
see Gregory Peck as give me a good he'd
be a good Clark and you'd be a great
yeah who did Jimmy Stewart play
and Victor Josh Gordon see where we're
not wrapped recasting the six to show
we're just saying who at the time could
have played some of these characters
that they didn't use on the 60 show
that's kind of what the conversation is
more from 1960s Badman already had a
perfect penguin arguably the definitive
penguins whoo yeah burgess Meredith
right presenting Mustangs name right
I don't know if you're saying is good
but a great penguin like the definitive
that show are the definitive penguin and
the definitive Riddler yes the Riddler
to which all other Riddler's are
compared yeah agreed
as much as I like the Arkham Riddler a
fucking warrior is a frank Gershwin I
think on that roll fucking own that roll
frank gorshin
I get gorshin yeah also the the Riddler
from Batman 66 remember the the famous
Star Trek episode with the people their
faces were half white and half black
yeah of course it was one of them really
yeah he got all around
no love for John Ashton Riddler no Frank
Gershon own that roll
which why are you not playing this
because it's on a ps4 and I'm not
playing the first-person shooter with a
gamepad
this is a highly dangerous environment I
suggesting with mark
pilots I detect an exit beyond this dog
check your heart inside
I want scorch this
right and remember the only reason I'm
playing this on the ps4 is because it
was very cheap and I didn't think I
would get much play time out of it right
I have I've gotten like I've been more
interested than I really thought I would
be if I can't worry about it I'm far too
worried about you do you Jack you do you
I'm gonna I'm doing a jiggy puffs says
jakey put up so I decided to see what
Mass Effect was about just finish Mass
Effect 3 feeling frustrated but still
happy for the experience and the
character stories thanks for leading me
to it key loss see ye I don't know the
thing they say the thing that Sally says
I don't remember heal us alive keyless
live ya know I'm glad you enjoyed it
yes more humans to Smosh don't you smush
him if I step over them yes I do yes I
do that's important
but fudge whoa ash has got a sword sent
a robot piloting a robot yes yes it is
I'm sensing some redundancies
uh-huh I don't understand if you have a
problem with this
kicking her ass feel like I'm doing
pretty well so far for now but I've now
I've lost her
excuse me
chantix cuz some of you were talking
about her right now yeah so I'm not
gonna get too into it but I don't I
don't think the DLC ending for Mass
Effect 3 fixed fixed anything it just
elaborated on everything that was
terrible so like it's still bad but it
just explained it more why it's bad it's
still bad I just understand more why
it's bad sure they sold another ending
no it was so poorly received they did it
for free
oh poor Mass Effect yes it was like a
film that explains midi-chlorians
because that was a real problem if
Libyans were still a bad idea no I think
the real problem is people just didn't
understand all they could about
midi-chlorians that was the real problem
they're rich did you like that episode
of half in the bag I haven't seen the
finished product I was pretty like I I
could have done a little bit more to
clean up my my super-sweet special
effects and and so I sent it to Jay on
Friday and I was like hey yeah here's
what I got done I don't know when you
wanted to get this out but you know this
is my my quick and dirty version but oh
I can make it make it better
also Jay failed to explain to me his
camera shot and so I thought this was it
was gonna be a much easier okay special
effect thing they wanted it so sorry I'm
happy to help
I'm just saying hey this is
congratulations
III I'm enjoying I'm enjoying the the
mixture of of you know a little
platforming things with shooting things
I would like
well what is that
is it gonna get timey wimey Jack would
you recommend this game so far it's
alright it looks like suddenly time
travels thing yes yeah here's um for
$8.00 so far
fiery dog poop says you guys played tell
tells Batman enemy within I'm liking the
direction they're taking with Joker's
and I'm not gonna read the rest because
it's spoilers but I have not I've not
played that they had over on the iPad
yeah they had a free trial you could
play like the first chapter yeah and I I
have never played a telltale game and
says like oh you know I could play this
could be a nice little like you know
going to the bathroom game like there's
just a fun little thing on the iPad I'll
give the first chapter a try holy shit
it was way worse than I was expecting
see I'm I'm leery of any game which
could hypothetically be converted into a
series of youtube links that's yes yes
that's exactly what it was it was it was
infuriating because you know like the
QuickTime events were awful and blatant
and just you know their excuse for
gameplay but then you know the whole the
whole crux of the of the other part is
the decision-making in the story like
you need to make a decision and there's
a timer on the decision yeah and so you
you don't really have time to like think
it through or sometimes you don't even
have time to read the full option yes
I'm just like oh maybe this one oh shit
I just called her a bitch I did not want
to do that and so like I felt I felt
really bad about every decision I had to
make because I didn't feel like I had
enough time to digest them mm-hmm and
then the QuickTime events were just you
know swipe left
that's why bright that's what Brighton
that's wiped down it was very bad
so nobody sees you when you go back into
the time no but apparently I could bump
into people and now there's dragons so
we got dragons
what happened everyone here their bodies
amazed unusually however some show signs
of weapon fire
hopefully Anderson's alive Anderson is a
veteran SRS pilot he has survived
multiple covert missions within enemy
territory
okay strange I supposed to shoot the
dragon with Sam's are they attacking you
then don't shoot that because then they
will attack you okay interesting I'm
detecting traces of a massive energy
explosion throughout this facility
however around the data does not detect
the same in the other timeline
but none of these remains match the
genetic profile with major Anderson he
may still be alive
what oh that's your the door that made
your Anderson died that's why I got you
you say would be will be or would be
there's a difference
I got a satchel Touche rich
budget Messiah so is just finished Star
Trek Discovery's 13th episode I think
you should get back into it shred shit
gets better after the mid-season even if
I still present the retcon of how
Klingons get cloaking devices I ain't
know if I if I go back to watch it I'll
binge it when the seasons done
I prefer binging shows anyway agreed but
tender says love the new half in the bag
great work guys those special effects
cost a fortune they took me they took me
some time I didn't do all the special
effects but and I and I won't spoil it
for anyone who hasn't seen it yet I can
go into I can go more thoroughly into I
did later
now I need to see the episode
okay that's fine I didn't want to go
there maybe important data within major
Anderson's helmet
you should retrieve it for analysis I oh
I see oh that's major Anderson I wasn't
even paying attention to that
bTW I found Anderson he's in the ceiling
objective complete we have rendezvous
with Major Anderson Charlotte his face
Mega's Alexandros I I tried watching
Gotham and I could not get into it rich
ever seen Gotham at all did you watch
that show I I should catch up with it
yeah I've watched and enjoyed it and
then at the point I caught up to where
they were
I never resumed once they started to
show up so I even watched past season
one okay it wasn't necessarily my thing
I remember you telling me about like the
one part you really liked about that the
victors are just walking into the police
station and and saying get out no they
listen that was the moment I loved the
show oh no I was talking about the
balloon killer oh that was just a
general great yeah yeah a balloon killer
I think that was funny
I would I think I would appreciate
something like that now the moment that
made that show for me I guess I'm
spoiling it now but it's two years old
at this point when Victor Josh he's off
to kill Commissioner not commissioner
Horton just Gordon deceptive gore's
optical Detective Gordon he just walked
right into Gotham PD yeah tells all of
the other cops to get out and they do
that wasn't what I loved that show
transfers to you congratulations on your
field promotion
the following is Anderson's mission
briefing from commander Sarah Briggs of
the militia SRS Major Anderson Oh two
weeks ago we intercepted IMC comms they
found something on Titan a massive blast
of energy was discharged at this
location creating time distortions I
want SRS on the ground to infiltrate the
facility Roger that
I'll get some answers it's wrist-mounted
device we've recovered during operation
grizzly should protect you
we know the IMC have contracted koukin
bullets and his mercenaries to protect
something critical there watch your back
SRS is a team
pilot the data vendors who collected
appears to be incomplete we are to
rebound to uphold and fulfill special
operation to 1/7 recommend we locate
Anderson's wrist mounted device before
proceeding
I didn't see any device on indocin they
must be on the other half of his corpse
I detect a breach in the security
services building
I will provide access what
the ring structure future future chases
Jack and Rich if you're interested in
playing Star Wars for billion are you
thinking to just play single-player if
you're up for multiplayer match I
volunteer as a player single dude master
Brian sucks but Star Wars rebellion says
Star Wars on it
Oh what
punch only run
which franchise has the worst fandom
here's the thing not not every fan of
everything is the same like that every
Star Trek fan is gonna like the same
things then every Star Wars fans is
gonna be an idiot the most most Star
Wars fans are it is so my vote how about
anime
how about anime family here here is what
I will say Star Wars fans are close to
the worst fandom are really close but I
think the actual winner for worst fandom
is video games in general okay okay the
the average comment section of any video
game show versus any movie show is
significantly worse for some reasons
video game fans have just something
straight up their ass
that's anybody who takes any work of
fiction too seriously you know chants
sang a lot of people who try to sing
Rick and Morty mm I have very little
experience with Rick and Morty as a
fandom Rick and Morty fans are fairly
obnoxious I know about the the Shae Swan
sauce incident at McDonald's that's all
I really know about they're just kind of
like the Rick and Morty fans I think are
just like everywhere and obnoxious about
it but you know at the same time they're
also just really excited to like Rick
and Morty fans are the types of fans
that will just what did you see me
become
we're comported fans are the types of
fans that will just repeat stuff from
the show without any context and that's
a pretty bad family yeah oh sorry oh
sorry sorry was that hitting a little
too close to home was that hitting a
little too close to home
when fans just repeat stuff from from
the source material without any context
that Anonymous's have you guys ever been
out of North America if so what was your
favorite place to visit where would you
like to visit or maybe do you think
traveling is overrated lol fuck my cock
and erupt of volcano god
hi I'm not much of a traveler Jackie
you've been around I have been around
I've been out of the country I've been
I've been many places I've been many
many places including out of the country
several times I've been to Germany for
an extended period when I was in high
school when I went to as a foreign
exchange student I spent some time down
in Ecuador and I went to the Galapagos
Islands which was frankly a wonderful
experience that we went on a little boat
tour following the path of Charles
Darwin as he was sailing through the
Galapagos coming up with with his theory
of evolution and and how the animals
they're adapted by the seasons and kind
of his they walked us through his whole
process of watching these tiny birds on
the island and how the different weather
would affect the next generation of
birds you know yeah
heavy rains mean more seeds and more
scenes meant that they were harder
bigger seeds and so then the next
generation of birds finches would have
bigger beaks or you know the bigger beak
ones would survive and produce more and
I'm paraphrasing horribly yes but uh but
it was a wonderful experience spent some
time down in South Africa we we shot a
video down there we shot a high five
World Cup video down in South Africa
when the World Cup was down there and
that was a wonderful experience it's got
to hang out my friends hang out in
Africa very different and very wonderful
that pause screen looks like a error
message I thought your game had crashed
oh and I wasn't even paying attention I
wish it was that I always come up the
gamble to go con that oh that was uh oh
no that was like the the next chapters
okay it looked like an error message
just plain text in a box like Oh Jack
you crashed
I I saw actually they had one of the
receptions that we went oh very um this
is very dishonored - mm-hmm because now
I have a time manipulation device so now
I can go back and full-length on one
level yeah like that one mo it was a
great level into Sonic - we we got when
we were down there they had a reception
for some celebrities and some of the
players actually where where I went to
interview what was his name bond ki-moon
the president of the you at the UN it
was at the prison that Nelson Mandela
was I was prison it was very neat - it's
all neat it was it was great I love
traveling I want to travel more how long
does a single-player campaign in this is
there enough to make this worth it as a
single-player experience maybe
it depends on how far we are like at
what time is it
844 so we've been we've been going for
three hours yeah so we've been going for
three hours how much more time do we
have
I have no idea well that's for people
who have played it that was a question
for people places seeing some minutes at
5:00 someone else at 8:00
so if I kill them in the past
they may be here what happened
have you considered that I like look at
this I just love it
get out of here get right out of town
what are you a gun are you
doo-doo-doo-doo
can't go up your time powers Jack you're
you're unstoppable you're an unstoppable
machine of destruction hi
oh you see there glows and the presents
yeah oh that just feels cheap right this
is how you do it this is by the way this
is how you do a night crawler game yeah
yeah is you transform into you know cuz
he goes through like the nether region
whenever he transports oh I'd love that
I'd love that
I'm just gonna cheese that all the time
all punch run starts now
you are so what happened to this place
shit
oh oh okay double wall I was gonna say
my name's we all read and jump into that
hole all punch punch trance mad punch
strats it's probably gonna be me because
we're gonna figure out that it was like
something evil is happening here so we
have to blow it up yeah that makes sense
oh shit I can't punch that thing Oh
shouldn't punch you
finish you off wonder the used bookstore
with Carrie yesterday
yeah and I found this fucking beautiful
giant sized hardcover weeping overjoyed
TMNT comic books oh yeah yeah no I don't
know for sure how many issues that had
been some of the earliest ones well
that's great I suspect up a volume of
collected Conan works cuz you know what
why not was there so I guess Jose could
be neat I like Quran well enough Conan
comics or Conan books mm-hmm that's fair
the actual Robert Howard books
I we got a new strat here first we got
to deal with mods and shed it's not okay
to ban anyone for for not liking a
certain baseball team unless they're Cub
fans that's that's previously recorded
rule they can be banned for baseball
reasons if they're Cub fans
fuck position keep Keller Nyjah that's
her stick now yeah
I know I know
who do I want to win the Super Bowl I
don't even know who's in the Super Bowl
the the monkeys and the the T to those
the Tito the Tito those the monkeys
versus the Tito those the the
Albuquerque monkeys versus the New
Hampshire Keitel those it's it's a
grudge match for the ages rich okay
Eagles in the Patriots oh well that
makes more sense
yeah I don't really have a horse at a
dog in this race I've heard Eagle fans
are jerks
sure
look what I've heard the Patriots team
are jerks so so they go six of one after
the other
this is clever this is a clever section
they've they've you know showed me my
time travel power and I said I was gonna
cheese it but they found a way to keep
me from cheesing it unfortunately
Eagles fans aren't jerks they're just
angry drunks wouldn't that make you a
jerk if you are an angry drunk yes
Eagles fans famously built the ship beat
the shit out of Santa Claus what this is
gonna incident where Santa Claus was at
an Eagles game or somebody else someone
dressed like Santa Claus yeah and fans
beat him up in an infamous incident that
happened
pumpkin bumped cake says any fandom that
just spouts out context quotes is
endless trash
fuck you fandoms it's January there we
go I got them you got all right you got
a right you you get it you get what's
going on here Nana says how'd you end up
at the World Cup anyway Jack were you
invited were you permitted to be ad said
world cup hmm
yeah we were invited we were there are
they baiting you into telling the story
oh the fun the I we were invited to go
to the World Cup the the boring version
is we were invited by a charity
organization that was helping raise
money and awareness for schools yeah for
African children and it was euro it was
a work thing you were filming I mean
yeah through Funny or Die they reached
out to Funny or Die and said hey can we
want a high five video with our
organization for the World Cup to help
raise awareness for funding for African
school so like we were there for like
actually really good yeah really good
cause and we were told that we were
gonna have access to a lot of places
yeah but our producer down in Africa was
like well we'll see where we can get in
and so a lot a lot of the places we
ended up getting and we kind of cheated
our way in we played the system anytime
you have an event that big you're gonna
find a lot of doors not being watched
Bay is basically the thing they they
have to hire a lot of new people for an
event that big and yeah just like well
hey you know we were definitely supposed
to be here and if it's a new person Isis
like we're like were we so the the the
story that I've told already was I told
the story I already told already no
tonight
fucking rerun night its rerun night
there there was a stadium we were
getting into and a bunch of players were
gonna be there and sports professionals
and more
it was a chance for us to be on an
actual pitch of the pitch is what you
call the soccer field and we wanted some
shots in a stadium on on actual soccer
field and so we pull up and there is an
armed guard I mean like machine gun
armed guard stopping us you guys can't
go in here and and our producer very you
know coolly goes we are absolutely
supposed to be here you're absolutely
not supposed to be able o we are
absolutely not supposed to be there we
have no right to be there and I forget
whether it was this guy or maybe it was
the second guy like we made it to
another layer and then the second guy
says whoa you guys can't be in here like
there there is an event happening and we
go we're supposed to be at the event
thank you oh that's what we tried to
tell the other guy we're definitely
events that is and and he's like yeah
the big news conference we're like yes
look at the camera and you know I have
my nice camera right I have the nice
camera and so he looks at the camera and
the second guy he goes he goes hmm let
me see some ID let me see some ID yeah
and so like we don't have any like
badges or press so we give him our
Wisconsin driver's license this is a man
with a gun who has maybe had a job
working here for a week we came and and
he looks at all of our wisconsin'
driver's license right he's like alright
go ahead
not my problem so so then we finally
make it to the state and all these
stadiums are brand new they're beautiful
soccer stadiums all like you know just
every everything about this is brand new
and we walk up to the soccer stadium and
another guard comes to stop us and we
decide like we got some momentum behind
AHA so we get we decide to get out in
front of this one here we go
yes thank you for meeting us can you
take us to the press conference
and the guard who I only presume was
there to stop us was like oh of course
it's right this way I'll show and we're
like thank you so much we are running so
late
and you know it started a while ago yeah
so so then we you know we sneak it and
they're giving a presentation at the
press conference and we are definitely
not supposed to be there all the other
people are dressed really nice these are
professional reporters asking sports
related questions and we are just some
schlubs right we are a bunch of schlubs
sneaking into a building and so but now
we're part of the group and then the
group finally gets assured out to the
pitch of a gun this is this is our
opportunity Oh how's our big plan so we
we get out there and it's gorgeous big
empty stadium beautiful pristine soccer
field and we start making our plans okay
we need this shuttle when you dish out
we got to move quick because at any
moment they are going to realize yeah
that we are not supposed to be here and
then just as we're getting our first job
set up someone stops us hey who are you
guys here with and we're like we are
here with Funny or Die and let me see
let me see your press passes we we never
got our press passes it was a whole
miscommunication thing we you know a lot
of Wieland deal a lot of like talking
without saying anything which is my
speciality we we never end a hold on for
just one second you know like calls are
being made people are being ouch - ever
these guys know no one's on a list so
they walk away and start talking amongst
themselves so we quickly get like two
maybe three shots oh yeah let's get
these really quick we're about to get
kicked out they come back with our press
pass they come back with our press s is
going it has been a nightmare here we
are so sorry for all of this confusion
what do you guys need you know cuz like
they were there to coordinate the media
and obviously we were the media right
yeah and so then we took our time we got
a bunch of amazing shots everything was
just hunky-dory that
is a world-class store it's it's it was
a fantastic time very similar again when
we were in South Africa we we had a
chance to to shoot a high-five with the
the president of the UN I'm gonna forget
his name again bond ki-moon or whatever
it is yes yeah
South Korean president or whatever also
a big part of the UN we're like we need
to get a high-five with him and we just
kind of we're at this big party and like
at like I said the prison that they held
Nelson Mandela
yeah and it's a big it's a big party and
we kind of snuck into that party too
because that's what you doing we just we
came with a big group of people we I
think that party what we did was there
was a big group of people who were
obviously supposed to be there and they
weren't celebrities or anything let me
get this straight yeah you snuck into a
prison into a prison
how we snuck into that particular party
was there was a big group of people who
were obviously supposed to be there on
the step and repeat you know like the
red carpet area where everyone takes
their pictures and we say hey we're here
with funny about we're shooting high
five so you guys want to do a quick
high-five with us and they go oh sure of
course thinking that we were part of the
press or shooter so we shoot a high-five
with them ah that's so great and then
they go to walk in and we just keep
walking with them and obviously the
guards who were learning you know the
ticket holders or whoever they were who
were guarding the front door just saw a
shoot something with them so we must be
with these people
so then we get we get word that
secretary or moon yeah this guy from the
UN is doing an on-camera interview right
now we can probably get in the queue to
do our thing first and I wasn't part of
this con yeah our producer was talking
to the UN Secretary's personal assistant
to get us in the queue to do things yeah
and so there was a lot of wheeling and
dealing and a lot of that's what I've
been trying to tell you yeah I know it's
a mess
here you know just a lot of the same oh
sure feel sure so finally we get in the
room with him and we explained to him
what we want to do like all you have to
do is we're gonna high five and you look
to the camera and and like that's all
you're hit and he's like oh wait what
and like he's very confused and I'm just
rolling cuz that's my job as the
cameraman like everyone's InFocus and
I'm just rolling he's like what well I
I'm not sure actually I'm supposed to I
was like an action and you know the
guy's high five and he looks because
he's a professional and then all of a
sudden everybody realizes we're not
supposed to be there everybody knows and
but wait like we already got it like all
right I know we're gone we're gonna
everything's gone everything's fine
though like yeah you should probably
leave now like absolutely that's the
point at every shoots a quick tip for
anyone who likes to shoot not
necessarily legal stuff always keep a
spare memory card you finish shooting
put the footage in your pocket put a new
memory card in the camera they didn't
they didn't do it but I did i hotspot
yeah right away because I knew it like
that no no we need that memory card like
cuz they know how cameras work yeah yeah
they know how cameras work so always
keep a spare blank memory card to
hot-swap just in case
I blew myself up that's okay you know
while we had the story those in that was
a great story so I have to do this whole
section over again all I might have to
cut damn it guys practical tip that is
that like that has I've never needed to
use that tip like I've never had someone
take my memory card but but I never want
to be in that situation where I lost the
footage
how are you still alive maybe a punch
isn't enough for some of the big wrists
there we go there we go oh shit
so anyway that has that has happened a
few times on some of our perfectly legal
shoots always better to ask for
forgiveness than permission
oh shit always better
oh we've used we've used Will Ferrell's
names so many times even even like you
know if he's not on the shoot like you
know because back in the day like you
know people still might not know what
Funny or Die is yeah and so like a lot
of times they'd have to be like oh we're
with Funny or Die
it's Will Ferrell's website obviously
like it's not just Will Ferrel website
but you know he was the big name you
know like really alright just yeah
sometimes you got a you got a exaggerate
just do do what you can
that's what it's all about doing what
you can't do
the test must be completed the IMC found
something all right it can fold space
and time
that's neat looking storing it that's
very sci-fi opening the catastrophic
Jack international man of mystery
packard I get the job done all right
when it's it's very different when
you're put on the spot like especially
for me I'm usually kind of a timid
person shit but you know you put you're
put on the spot and more importantly you
have a job to do and and sometimes you
just need to know when when to pull
those punches if I if I don't if I don't
get the shots we don't have a good video
and I don't make videos anymore
what FPS did the hollow cutscene thing
that was doom doom did that help talking
Holograms for cutscenes yeah because
they weren't really cutscenes yeah
they weren't really cut scenes a lot of
them you could just ignore and keep
shooting at things right I mean it's not
much different from like Naughty Dog's
not cut scene cut scenes no but people
stand around at our in game the great
thing about doom and you know what a
dishonor to did this a lot to where it's
you never leave your perspective yeah
you you get to watch the story but you
never it never takes you out of the game
which is something I enjoyed about
that's something I really enjoyed about
both doom and a tic
okay
about doom and dishonor to app that's
fair timing oh cool that was neat huh
that is neat yeah that's a funny this is
a fun gimmick yeah I'm down I'm down
with this gimmick
this game seems to have taken some good
in spirit if some inspiration from the
crooks from the right sources try this
game I might I have to install origin to
do it when she something I don't really
want to do maybe I could pay for it
legally and find some sort of crack like
pay for it on origin but then just
pirate it just because you don't want to
deal with all really I really don't
keep great
ah nope nope nope nope nope nope
Jack like this gimmick when it was in to
sign of two as well I did I think I
think it it actually works slightly I
think it works slightly better in
Dishonored 2 if I'm gonna be honest but
I think this is fine
Chadd Dead Rising 3 isn't the worst
thing but I'm not I'm not feeling a
strong urge to finish it
oh I get it
see this to me
this right here is is showing how I
think the game fails on some design
aspects basically what this is saying is
there is a really cool thing to do right
here and if you want this ghost runner
can show you the really cool thing that
you can do yeah and what that means is
that this area isn't intuitive enough on
its own for me to figure out the cool
thing yeah they need to show me with the
cool thing is what I'm guessing it is
let's see if I can do this right is they
want me to wall run at the time that's
pretty cool yeah that's pretty cool
but the level wasn't laid out in a way
where I could necessarily figure that
out by myself all right which you know
that's just a design issue that's not
necessarily a a big deal are you saying
you hate it I basically I hate it
basically what I'm saying is I hate
everything about this game what are you
a flatline
like like with just a few hours of
dicking around with Dead Rising 3 yeah
just just on my own I found a way to
completely cheese it and level myself up
fully
uh-huh it's not a very smartly designed
game jeez they got a combo system that
multiplies you score his weapon that
kills a lot of people just make a bunch
of those and get from level 1 to 50 in
like two hours
uh-huh look at that see this is what I'm
talking about right in your face this is
good look at this
ready no in in in the past that platform
is there in this path platform is gone
yeah so you gotta that's fun that's fun
Check Point
oh no chef there's nothing wrong with
having a combo system but here's the
thing beating up on zombies isn't
exactly the most satisfying thing
they're there fucking zombies
that's that's like it's like reading up
Stephen Hawking and a kung-fu contest
why you dissing on Stephen Hawking
mentally not at all physically I could
kick his ass you think it's pretty
presumptuous of you you don't know what
kind of Texas wheelchair has
okay
hahaha yep I was waiting for this check
this out oh yeah okay so down but they
do this again like I've already figured
out the bit but now they're giving me
the we can show you how to do this bit
if you want yeah that's fine nope nope
nope
wait have it down but you get the
concept I get the concept
do they have to assume everyone playing
the game is moron no I see then that's
my problem is they do they do assume
everyone playing yes moron do they have
to sum someone whose head someone who is
the head of something thinks that it's
very important that the game would be
you know accessible to any level of
moron mm-hmm that's it that's what's
gonna sell more copies we need all the
morons to buy this yeah it doesn't
matter if it makes the product a little
watered down at the end of it then you
lose the smart people's interest that's
that's what happens with dead rising
can you turn off Hynson me mm I think
Jack likes that suggestion
I like that suggestion it doesn't it
does not appear that I can but I like
that suggestion sprint
I'm on regular difficulty I wonder if I
might go up a difficulty level it does
but no it does not look like I can
change that I like that that's a that's
a good thinking though before I whine
any longer oh it's a helmet or it
recommended you do something because you
took a long time in an area chatting
with fridge and it thought you were
stuck haha very possible very possible
now let's see look this but this guy's
popping up right away he's popping up
right away
nice
not that one wait maybe that one yep
good job that's pretty cool
pretty good that's pretty cool that's
neat this damn thing was just a test one
of our own planets is next they're going
to hit harmony and they moved up the
timeline I have to get this into other
Sarah
that was major Anderson's final
recording Oh Cooper based on your recon
of this facility I may have a plan
meeting outside okay no problem Optimus
optimus you know I can never call you
bTW because you sound like optimists
oh look at that that's very techy I like
to look at that I like it
someone probably spent a lot of time on
that do you think anything this like a
hole this is like 2 months worth of work
just some pretty to look at that's great
that's great
deflator Mouse's rich can't you please
say OMG deflator Mouse no I can't say
the rest of that I love the last half in
the bag I love you guys keep on keeping
on manases do jack and rich
I know Jack mentioned this and a best of
the worst episode but if any of you
played I have no mouth and I must scream
by the loveable Grum Harlan Ellison I'm
not played it but I'm familiar with the
story and I was I was referencing the
story mm-hmm I was not referencing the
game they didn't make it a game they did
and it's just a short horror story right
and it's like I think I might've read it
at some point
I think subscribers deserve access to
written copies of tips you won't read
for historical purposes nope nope it's a
point-and-click adventure
oh okay yep Ellison worked on both the
story and the game oh he wrote the short
story the game was based on so yeah it's
not shocking but did he also like work
on the game probably probably rewrote
bits and pieces of it oh sure
cool Jack you buy those short story
horah books I do I did I did last time
The Ghost Box it was called the
collection of short spooky stories and
then for Christmas I got their their
advent calendar their short story advent
calendar yeah and I got a little behind
but it's okay because I took a whole
bunch on on my vacation with me but it
was great just a little short story that
you're supposed to read every day
leading up to Christmas you know like
like a candy and yeah calendars for
short stories and it was really
wonderful some of them I recommend some
of those stories are very very good now
closest act to the ending of this
I mean this game in general I know
multiplayer first-person trains that
they usually on the shorter end
I know I know I got a run over here
because these dinosaurs double fight
this is seeming like a climax yeah what
Oh wrong part I thought that dinosaurs
were in this part nope that's not where
I wanted to throw that oh my god robots
too
you gun
shit shit fucking blow it already hate
that dinosaurs be easier to play they
they respond they respond dinosaurs
respawn so you can't spend too much time
choosing over in that area because
dinosaurs wallrun check please huh
they're mad you're not wall running
enough for this game I'm sorry you'll
just do a whole bunch of unnecessary
wall runs like whatever you can all the
time okay
why didn't you all round that sign right
here
why are you all running right now I know
there's no wall oh wait here City and
there we go and I got stuck
did I beat you all great
pilot I've located the controls to
extend the bridge to the rings I've
marked it on your hub controls it
appears that whatever actions you took
in the past have caused the remaining
automated security systems to be quite
hostile towards you guys recommend this
game for FPS players like I don't feel
comfortable doing that just because I'm
not the one playing it looks okay
yeah like I I think there's a lot of fun
there's some neat stuff I I'm not sure
it does anything better than the games
that it is clearly I don't want to say
ripping off but you know you know I
definitely feel some doom in here I feel
some Dishonored 2 I think that's I think
that's what they're trying for with all
the fast movements I don't I don't think
I don't think they do it as well as do I
think that should be a first person
shooter standard feature I don't think
that should be unique dual I think doom
doom is just a good first-person shooter
to made it made it popular whoa I can
time-travel in the robot now
okay great I think moving quickly was
around long before doom I mean we'll
finish times there there is an emphasis
on movement in new doom that I feel have
Tate has taken it to a whole new level
you're supposed to go to I gotta do this
over again why do I have to do this part
all over again
yeah oh well good
according to walk through there are four
more chapters after this one okay
I'm just finishing me I'm just gonna
finish this yeah I was like where's like
one war left its run wash level oh yeah
you know let's just do it right
Wow motherfucker motherfucker yeah
because you fucked up I I thought it
would have automatically saved and I got
through the other big ass fight and then
I thought I needed to jump the area
oh yeah
fucking hell daddy
that's what I did last time I'm just
gonna do the same thing this time
what what hello
Oh Chad I'll be disappointed if we're
not the ones who caused this disaster in
the first place
nope yeah there needs to be that moment
where it's like oh my god we did this
yeah I agree
no bad guys anyway right yeah right
it's a mess Steve oh there we go oh
there's stuff but there's still bad guys
here
can't have that they're saying why kill
everything do you not need to kill
everything to move on oh I don't know
maybe you're assuming a lot apparently
hi I didn't even shoot you on your way
to beat him in the face yeah
it appears that whatever actions you
took in the past have caused the
remaining automated security systems to
be quite hostile towards us in the
present way this is the past though
right I don't know it looks nice in the
past okay
hello
I know walk on
I love punching things oh this is where
I was supposed to go see I thought I
needed to jump across that gap and I
died it had to redo the entire level but
apparently I Joe let me go up here let's
go
all right here we go
this isn't the loan I wanted anyway I
wanted the quad rocket mother fucker
the quality of the controls to extend
the bridge to the race
oh my god something really exciting is
happening keep holding
scan the Arquette Center wait would you
where'd you go buddy
where'd you go
leave my friend over here hey
you will never tell me that that is not
the greatest thing I will never believe
you I know I'm dying
when you go back in time
she don't want to this shit overhead
Jack no
No
some more Healy's over here all right
soul power soul power
what happened I think you just blew up
the past
yeah that's neat
it's just like quantum break oh I can
ride something what am i right
okay
so times frozen yeah I was like working
I'm just moving my head through the
light particles
then whenever you stop moving you
shouldn't see anything yes how are you
breathing that's a great question
it's doing quantum break better than
quantum break yeah
well done pilot scan complete
as Anderson discovered the IMC intend to
destroy the militia planet of harmony
using the full-scale version of this
weapon pilot Cooper our journey is far
from over
we must get this data to the fleet no
problem Optimus I hacked time I did it
you did it jack I did it
you're a hero for the space Federation I
think I think I'm a militia
I think I'm space militia but also I
don't think I'm in space I think I'm
