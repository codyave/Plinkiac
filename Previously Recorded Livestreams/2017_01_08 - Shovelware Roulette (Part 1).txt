Oh Jack you're gonna get mauled from
above
you didn't miss it oh really she never
got into it yet I guess your block from
the other way stuff this tough
maneuvering this sword is a pain in the
ass I'll tell you one which I'm sure is
the point
all right almost there you almost got
them Lions Jack you almost gotta get
that Oh get that damn oh yeah did it do
something about it in the room don't
worry about it get to get the yellow
thing you killed the Lions oh just what
you needed to do
yeah yeah mighty hunter okay great
shrubs me I fuck you kill the shrubs
before you can get in there just
dangerous shrubs it's fine you know
that's fine it's fine everything's fine
there
I found a thing I found a musical note
Jack great you have a beautiful singing
voice you don't have a beautiful singing
voice
oh the gift shop II here and triumphant
Lord Hufflepuff says I think I'm the
only dead here but that's fine they can
concentrate on the game or chat or
whatever it's all good this this is it's
close combat between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
so can we change the time on the
computers clock I'm hoping that's what
I'm hoping for
say what cyan key I have the green key
yeah but I can't but by the way I can't
get in from the bottom because of my
sword'
can I put my sword away no you can't get
in from the bottom when happens you've
tried to get in from the bottom of the
might I can't I can't shoot me my sword
around the bottom path yeah I'm thinking
change our computers clock okay I'll tab
all right go to adjust date and time
just turn to time automatically off and
then go back
scroll down change date and time it is
no longer 10:00 p.m. it is 6:06 p.m.
change only 20 p.m. I am do we know he's
at p.m. okay nope
oh wait
do I not have a save do I not have a
save
where's low do loads obviously okay we
need it we need another autosave these
are all at 8:00 p.m.
these are all tickle moss whoa
no cancel like if I quit I don't have to
go through all this again I have to
imagine we ought to save at some point
but don't even think about it is what
they're saying about quitting I'm
assuming that's what they're talking
about yeah but I don't know that listen
but what I think you needed to do is
change like that before you started the
game you know I don't think we've saved
since we've been in here for that exact
reason
oh it's find I don't seem to stay dead
nope
the megasaur Jack Oh dire shrubs the
mega sort of xanthe are is yours Lord
Hufflepuff says you do not need to
change your system clock
we're not that cruel we have a dev in
the chat oh we're not that cruel I don't
trust you why would we
I played frog fractions by the way frog
fractions Devin chat is the game that
got jacked like the text adventure
that's true I just unlocked the gamepad
support rich trout that ps3 control
she's just fixed I don't know if that
natively supports we don't have a
bluetooth no I don't think I do she's
used I'd want to try out the new one but
let's just try to disclose what we know
works see if it does anything
Oh
somebody's saying maybe use the torch on
the centipede which not a terrible idea
I found that in past rooms and it didn't
kill the centipede
it just lightly singed it it was a nice
thought it was
no gamepad support or at least not yet
but you don't but oh my god in this
background
okay so so that it gives us the correct
time
yeah thank you okay
it said good said hold on it's good
options it said it unlocks controller
support well then we don't know what
that means exactly might be something
clever that comes up later where we
could only do something with the gamepad
sure
so just we'll keep that we'll keep that
in our pocket that ready yeah that's
ready rich okay yeah oh shit so we have
that we have a master sword now a mega
sword so now we can take care of dire
strokes oh ok onward I think we only
support Xbox controllers well we got the
Xbox one controller that's the way I
have a comple earlier in this stream we
fix a ps4 controller that had a broken
analog stick yeah but we don't want to
risk using that because there might be
driver issues we have hooked up an Xbox
one controller we just plugged it in I
don't know if that's an issue I don't
know if it needs to actually be plugged
in before the game starts sure see so
this area I can't I can't wiggle my
sword
where's it just 360 controllers oh and
I'm waiting for confirmation of some
sort
like
yes oh yeah maybe it needs to be in on
boot why are we do we have to worry
about saving are we auto-saving can we
just restart the game and then okay
we've gotten to the red shrubs shit okay
rich try going back to the blimp
somebody is saying up oh that's right
there were shrubs in the blimp shit
you're right before we get to before we
get too ahead of the game no saving and
ASCI I world yep all right saw that
coming
bunch of bull hockey or that's just how
it was
they're trying to emulate these games
which is fine I get it the game
auto-saves every time you get a pick up
there's a little saving icon in the
bottom right corner you'll see okay so
if you want to try restarting to get the
gamepad support this is completely up to
you Jack you're playing this is 831
there yeah I don't trust it
I don't trust it I don't trust it and I
don't trust them and once it's
auto-saving I've seen it yeah yeah yeah
they're gonna keep saying it too cuz I
don't trust it Lord huff and puff says
again we're not that cruel thanks gonna
do what Jack's gonna do and I can't make
him do things so then it it last saved
when I got the mega sword right yeah
it's like wrangling a greased up pig
this is not gonna work eggs a game go
back into game
I'll be s open now we're gonna play
glitter mitten Grove and it's back okay

I'm sorry I'm reading what I see I have
a bridge now rich hero I got here what
what what what happened are you losing
all your items go up what's in the sand
or
okay so we just end up back here after a
time
okay Groundhog Day
Jimmer K says if you go back to the
sewer with the bridge you can play part
two of passive-aggressive xenomorph what
oh wait we're gonna clock here that's
running yeah yeah and the clock only
goes remember back I said
11:40 this something is gonna ring now
yeah then I wake up again and so you
remember remember this yeah 1122 1147 so
we can change the clock
oh wait this can get this right this can
get me into the shop but we're had to
run because it moves fairly fast you
don't have any of your items by the way
I know I'm just setting the clock this
time oh oh this is the real clock yeah
where was it from six six to ten go
earlier than six if you can
get your things and fuck up the clock
again SEF fired back jingo no but I just
wanted to see if it started again edited
like maybe just if it's not going back
again though I bought me a little bit
it's saying you can use the torch torch
torch that's what I meant
well I didn't have it at first now I
have it find the shop find the shop find
the shadow fan shot and get gems on your
way to the shop
alright where's the shop I don't know oh
it's here it's over here have these devs
made anything else they made frog
fractions motherfucker
oh but I can't get in there because my
sword
well don't grab the sword next time
we're gonna have to reset yeah punch
yourself
yep that doesn't work apparently
son-of-a-bitch
stop it I can't turn I gotta drop the
bridge if you press the other buttons
you could change it by 10 minutes or an
hour at a time just for your information
oh that's what I was trying to do hello
we're back which one do we come from
this one down yeah can you put away your
sword oh they were sitting there where
someone just went into the door you sure
we'll move it ahead because we need to
get rid of the sword uh-huh we need to
get rid of the sword we need to reset so
when you run the sword so you can get in
the shop well no no I can just go around
the other way if I remember with you oh
no there's another way in let's find
them all right all right Lord Huff Huff
says all right I'm headed out but thanks
again for playing my game thumbs up
thank you Lord Huff huff
thank you bigoted
you can also change the am/pm yeah oh
I'm here oh you can change the reset
time yeah
what am i doing
oh my laptops out of batteries I can't
not read tips what am i what am i doing
rich I don't know I don't know what
you're doing i I just I gotta put down
this bridge that's number one
right
rich is gone I don't know where riches
I'm trying to figure this out and I'm
forgetting where everything is
alright alright I'm seein what's
happenin
so what's up everyone how's it how's it
um how's it hanging
how's everyone doing
hopefully everyone's having a good time
I'm glad everyone came out today
figuring out a little a little frog
fractions too you know
maybe do this wrong
I reset me
any reason why that didn't work is there
any reason why that didn't work is there
any reason that I didn't work huh
gosh darn it
I'm gonna try a different tactic I'm
gonna try the using of the bridge tactic
Oh or that works oh there's a little guy
there's a little guy rich let's take a
little guy running around there's a
little guy running around well if you
can find him that is great do we turn on
the torture yes okay
that clerk is asleep
the laptop is on the charger right now I
need a yellow key rich I do not have a
yellow key what happens if I stay in
here after it closes yeah can you have
yellow okay before I got another thing
maybe you have to be an employee to get
in to get the yellow key is there an
application what
it's gonna hang out in here until after
they close see what happens
so my sort around see a message here
great clerk is asleep
it's a wicker basket okay I'm just gonna
hang out here till it's only a little
bit I figured out what it was it wasn't
getting rid of my sword it was using the
bridge by the way three more letters and
we'll be done with the game is that true
yeah what letters I think those are
letters over there I think is the idea
all right we're almost done swing my
little most plan playing it to
completion if we're close what time is
it
talk to the shopkeeper
try the door watch yourself okay I work
at least you can punch yourself okay so
we need to become an employee or we have
to get a yellow key or something you
might need to purple all of the letters
that sounds reasonable
I'm sorry what we might need to make all
of the letters purple what is that green
are can you pick up that green I
actually cannot pick up that girl what
is it I did I picked it up before so
what's the deal with that monster on the
side then t-rex we have to be able to
get out there right I'd love to be able
to tell you man I would just love to say
what all the things are bound wait
Shepard there you are here's the report
on those donuts you asked us to get
after a vicious battle with the black
hole black hole Suns mercenary group we
claimed their great treasure that
cruller of despair then Jack just
straight-up ate it classic Jack that's
Jack we had no luck on Trident because
Thane assassinated every single Baker
before they could bake us a donut I
guess they were particularly evil
Baker's but still annoying here's your
Mass Effect tie-in by the way yeah yeah
Marla the pleasant the pleasantly chubby
was going to give us one of her
doughnuts but then Miranda started
talking about how annoying it was to be
genetically perfect and
Erlich kicked us out of her harem colony
bakers and quorum chased us out with
pastry forks as soon as they saw
professor solace turns out he's
responsible for giving their donut
sentience and teeth which is a bad
combination the CEO was celebrating some
weird holiday were young a sorry try to
sneak a jelly donut into a just a car's
pocket for good luck SMERSH says to tell
you you're welcome for the donut and you
over 5,000 credits for dry-cleaning
someone named sticky fingers Larsen
Larsen Ian sent Garris message saying
remember our bet that I can only steal
this yada yada yada yada yada yada yeah

come from the shop we found the gem
Factory which was up north oh yeah go up
north I'm gonna show you something
go to the gym factory yeah go over the
bridge see you're right
yeah that was some thing you could have
gotten no no we can still get that that
just says yes sent to page centipedes
nearby yeah so we need to kill the
centipede yes so we can still do that
thing you need to be whipped we have to
grit some gems so we can stab him
properly yeah but but what apparently
I'd no longer have my fire which gets
rid of gems I have pairs is your torch
in storage
what can we get rid of our own gems
I found a purple key I'm good we might
need that lantern or Kendall
it's Parrish now we have a pair
okay well we get that one that's
something
he's busy okay I got one
maybe if I throw all my pears tread
let's get all we can first good good
good oh did I mess up you watch yourself
it's blocked punch myself there we go so
just this guy right here use the bridge
that's a good idea
hey can you can you get the bridge no
can you get it from the other corner
there no it's designed so that you can't
get the bridge oh oh oh wait was this
thing over there yeah
uh-huh
okay good work Jack did something I did
something right well now I just got to
skim along the entire edge of this right
oh wait there's another thing up there
here there's two messages here now all
right well then we'll see here that's
weird
don't I think lots of things are weird
yes that's also true I'd like to kill
the centipede do we still have the torch
I don't know I have pairs can you get
rid of the perish I'll try throw in all
the pairs take it to the bridge I said
take it to the bridge
I don't know that thing we just got see
what happens if we go to the bridge take
take what to the bridge we don't I don't
know I read the things the thing we just
got was a letter people are crazy
five four pairs well that turns things
okie turn it into a green door
oh my fire came back haha I just needed
to get rid of my pairs I got I got a
purple thing I don't know if I can
handle any more corn factoids you know
Sam yep all right
wait go up how do we get that centipede
can we use the bridge to get that
through the wall or something I don't
know if we need to sweep
it's not know what your guess is just as
good as mine did we get all the things I
don't know what we got and where we got
them Jack I don't know because that's
the name of the game right now is just
finding all of the purple things so like
like there's a purple thing we need for
example it's not one we need yeah
oh do I already have that okay I already
have that purple thing okay so then we
go there's a red key in there I don't
know if I still need that or what I
and we were over here a little bit ago
you guys been to the area to the far
right and down past the red Dyer bushes
we still haven't gotten past the metal
Dyer bushes bridge to the blimp bridge
to the blimp and reading the things
already unlocked gamepad support
motherfucker that's the thing then we
get that already I don't know I really
don't know oh yeah we did
take the bridge into the blimp
take the bridge into the bump you can't
you cannot I will show you why in just a
moment I'll check this air Oh this area
also I cannot get the bridge but I got
all those so it's cool laptops on the
charger I'll check tips before we're
done
let's pick musical note in there bridge
to that thing what I got that to the
right oh yeah we need that how do we get
there from the blue thing up top there's
another thing you need at the top right
- is there what's over that way what's
over right from here I think that's
bring the bridge with you you can get
two things let's go down maybe and to
the right I think that's where the metal
bushes are at that if we can't get pests
let's find out okay hey you know what
rich we got a plan oh we got ourselves
them get the fuck I need to turn I need
a wife kita turn off auto skates okay
fuck you too
fucking sword alright Oh
oh yeah yeah you see that's right we
haven't been what's in there or two in
that door is there anything in there
what have we been down down what's in
that thing there in the middle of all
that arrow junk the oh yeah we've been
in there okay it's this area right we
haven't killed anything in here since
we've gotten the sword we don't need to
kill anything we need to go there's
there's a door to the left yeah and I
bet and usually those doors only open
when you kill everything okay so I'm
guessing that we need to kill everything
in this room
fYI you can kill those shooters oh you
can kill the things on the left that
shoot that would be that would be
incredibly helpful if Hammurabi wouldn't
keep killing you that'd be great fucking
sword nope no fucking sword hey got to
him you know what I got two of them also
they can shoot through my bridge just
putting that out there I did not know
they could shoot through my bridge I
thought I was kind of protected that's
it now okay
okay
it's fine it's fine everything is fine
Hammurabi yeah the purple things are
supposed to be gorillas right that's not
what they're supposed to be didn't
somebody say I think that's just in your
head man well the one thing we're lions
and the other thing were cockroaches I
think I think the fairy mentioned
something about purple gorillas but yeah
I've been wrong before
I think the fairies and something about
purple gorillas which is a normal thing
that you say when talking about this
game okay all right kill the thing come
here day
he's come here day okay we got we got
one yes done what's the other yes
you need to keep some of the gorillas
alive
