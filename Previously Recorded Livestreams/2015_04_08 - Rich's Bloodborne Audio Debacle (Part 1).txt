can you ever know can you hear me though
oh right so I'm audible that's that's
excellent news
ah I'm not used to fucking around with
the audio so I Jake Jake can't be this
device I'm supposed to use and I've I
have no idea how to use I'm just got
fumbling around with it
trying to we're gonna have to deal with
rich sounding like shit until until Jack
shows up and then he's gonna bring his
his better sound equipment and
everything and we'll be fine
well buddy fine you know I'm sure Jay
set this thing up so I would sound like
a chipmunk deliberately I'm just sure
that's what happened back to the game
we're gonna do game continues
can you imagine what its gonna sound
like what I laugh I hope something makes
me laugh
yes no no before before before Jay left
him I he might be back later but he said
all right wait I gotta slip that audio
up for you let me let me take care of
that I'm gonna do that no give me no
give me the thing I got it hey I got a
step that up for you okay okay Jake okay
whoa you're gonna do that all right and
look what happens look what happens oh
that's nice everybody is still dead even
though I turned off the game and we head
to reload the weight it's saved and
everybody is still dead 90 I like that I
like that only I'm not getting any audio
in my headphones first it is a little
bit annoying
Sadie okay can I fix that we're
send me with some separate or sound
honey where it's gonna be a fucking
audio thing audio devices audio audio
right I'm not getting all are you give
me some audio out of my headphones all
right what the hell happened
I just died the game tells you when you
leave the game
haha all right I got dealers look I love
the game I don't love this forty fucking
five second long loading screen every
time you die that's just a kick to the
nuts and the way I understand it it
definitely sounds like I got kicked
unless everybody's not dead because I
died so many fuck
what I noticed it's not real it's unreal
how many blood echoes I'm gonna have
what if I go ahead make my voice sound
deeper do I sound like a chip off the
old
that is something silly for Jackson's
absolutely not it's absolutely not true
everything wrong
by the way I'm assuming that the only
fitting of song there's my son which
makes it that much better
I'm gonna have words with Jay about
about about this this microphone he gave
me because I'm sure I've been sanitized
I'm almost 100% sure much much to your
delight and my further
thank you
I don't I can be proud of it I just I
just fled from two old ladies and a
mangy dog for my life I fled for my life
first time that's enough that's enough
kind of started consternation darn
so many blood that goes you won't you
won't be able to believe it
somebody let that go
my weapon of choice is either the sword
or the axe pretty fond of the axe I
found that blunt-force trauma
goes uh goes a long way in this game
you yeah come on

nice second of all
that's so that's so okay jokes that's
fine that's fine
do what I'm kind of ready to set things
up what do you need to do well I need me
to turn on your computer editor yeah
trader is on okay well is there anything
wrong we're just sprinting through the
ps4 this morning why we just do that
rather than make it alight as want to
complicate it sure we can get different
audio setup that's fine
people like seeing the chip people like
see I think so do you like seeing the
chat chat
extreme the jet jet hey check your luck
see the chat check highlights around the
chat chat there's the check I like
seeing the chit chat
like why make a life more difficult
5,000 really I'm early enough that's
that's few upgrades it's cute yeah
oh that's how it is figuring it out yeah
that would have been nice
what I'm trying to read it jet you
Chaney's I can't think of any spikes in
the safety so I don't know wonderful
heat Phoenix it's just it's just this
it's trying to send me over the edge
that's what that was oh alright suppose
you know what you're sore it has your
thorn head fight forward had a fight
we need nothing to anyone you know what
am i whispering in this game god damn
dogs yes I agree do you feel bad when
you kill them no I feel I feel great
when I kill them because I hate them and
I want them all to die I feel bad I want
them all to die
I cannot just come out here and let's
play don't dance around in there come on
did you get your ass out here you dumb
motherfucker because I was some lava
it's a fairly easy boss but yeah but
what happened was just so stupid what
happened was you let your guard down
what happened was they wouldn't stop
attacking yes that's what they do
they're enemies they attack you
the bad guy won't stop being bad Jack
Jack I'm in no mood from knocking
mannequins no mood yeah you you take
that ship somewhere else
that's funny so this is something easily
that should have went the first time
look look see see that's what should
happen
that's exactly what should happen
I mean I agree
they're not exactly that not exactly to
that learning pattern harder faster
stronger she's about ready to switch
over audio sources yeah yeah
plug something in I don't know if it I
like
okay okay we might we might be doing
something we might be doing something oh
no game audio fixed
oh yeah now it's coming through here
again I think we dealt with this last
time how do we deal with that last time
as soon as you're done fighting some
done fighting some people okay press the
the PS home button and then you have to
go to sound and the screen devices and
audio devices
there we go or do that I would put two
device how about do I is this switch
that to okay that worked that work that
worked wonders that worked wonders
yes okay
back to chipmunk voices oh go back go
back to chipmunk voices nope
here it is maybe now I can't hear us
because our paws turn down for wat I
think it means like something's telling
you turn down turn out for what turn
down turn down for what if something
smells inside music it sounds like hey
we're hip turn down for what
yo to me it sounds like defiant you know
like he's trying to like he's trying to
be like I ain't turning this down turn
down for what
that's just how I how I read into it and
yes I know I could have taken the
shortcut but I'm I'm kind of from it I'm
for me
okay
I think I think we're actually good I
think we have good audio then we no
longer sound like just enough to close
the checkmarks Chipmunks okay which is a
real thing
chick looks turn-on for what for what
oh wait I'm going to try to make it
better I might make it worse
this is a real thing
okay let's see if I made it better or
worse testing testing testing testing
okay
oh that's better for me and Richie are
you here
testing testing testing testing one two
three ah mother fucker good now we're
not getting any rich but I but I will
you know any rich we're not getting any
rich okay that's okay so we can fix that
we can fix that
okay rich
yes fuck one two three testing one two
three one two three that sounds great
testing we want J what do you want
we're getting now we're getting a very
strange like white noise hits from your
microphone oh yeah did you get the mix
up oh he might have I don't think so but
you know what you can always trade it
out for a different mic and see that gas
that my audio would be fine who's that
what what happened is microphones have
to kind of standard kilobits per second
rates in which they transfer data and if
it was set to one and the ps4 assumed it
was the other it would make you
something to block okay and so that's
probably what happened we're gonna swap
out your mic though don't you down to
zero for a second don't touch audio I
know you guys I'm just trying to make it
perfect for you
where is it
joking poor taste or good things you
know you gotta go it's Porter's justice
justice justice justice justice justice
that's be testable ah that is detestable
okay
snapping right front oh my big dumb
dummy yes three I'm trying to figure
this out you figure out how many licks
it takes to get to the center of a
Tootsie Pop roll no surprisingly no no
good the guard is good this car his his
good garden
good guard bad good good bad good bad
good
I'm sure the chat is just loving all
this audio test goodness that's what
they came here for this is what you this
is why you guys come early you think
it's fine this is why you guys come
early right now
Rich's microphone is non-functional did
you change it out I did then apparently
this really is the bad one maybe the
other one is going bad too I don't I
don't know I suppose that's a
possibility I suppose that's a possum I
suppose we can just take that one and
put it right between us we could we
really good this is the real thing
like that
mmm microphone movement noises which is
good which is good which is good at
games in general wonder if it's my cable
it's still not a - fuck it I told people
hate o'clock so it's we're technically
early I'm still I'm gonna I'm gonna
fiddle I got my echoes 4,600 nice guys
have to kill that stupid witch oh god
you're not done yet don't don't call
them get all you got him gonna fight
yeah they're not gotten yeah well
they're retrieved in the sense that I
won't completely lose them a red I'll be
able to try and get them again right
you person in the chatter told me not to
use the charge attack fuck you those
were working good don't listen to them
you know how you play everyone plays
different everyone plays different I
thought maybe I might do more damage per
second then no it's not about that it's
it's about what you're comfortable doing
and if you're more comfortable with the
charge attack and that's what you do
whoa nice job
nice
Oh
whoa-oh she's up for there that's neat
during my fight she never went up there
gilad echoes perfectly describe the
audio no it shouldn't be actually
everything should be wonderful right now
rich only let Jack read the ten that's
right rich is playing
Oh God whoa
oh is that her with the sliver of mouth
or is that one of those oh yeah but
there's two of them well the other ones
dead
I see you like to double to have to
dodge to that's something that I find
myself doing a lot is double tapping to
dodge even though you only have to press
it once really
dammit god dammit Oh God get out of
there get on
I'm doing the color commentary
now you can't ignore the minions Jeff
racks because they're the ones that do
real damage here you have to balance
little minion little little head which
rich is doing a fine job of balancing
and that's what it's all about
fools Vern my favorite video game
producer or music producer my favorite
video game music composer is Chris
Christopher Lou I'm sure I'm butchering
his last name the guy who did the
soundtrack for risk of rain I listened
to that soundtrack all the damn time you
did that seal god damn it
then Prunty is also very there all right
be afraid what the fuck was that one
more oh it's awesome
it's an awesome game again spoiler alert
but of course it's not really a spoiler
alert because we'd stream to this the
last three streams because we just want
to keep playing yeah fuck yeah it's
amazing
yep right
sure okay you got it
what did you do it did you do it yeah I
did it I did it I was a high five right
there that was harder than I remember it
being the first time maybe did you have
more insight this time maybe I'm not
sure what I had the first time yeah
jay-z I'm gone okay yeah yeah
figure out what's wrong with you mics
