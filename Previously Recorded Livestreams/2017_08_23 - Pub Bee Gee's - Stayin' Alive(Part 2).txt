around him

that one dramatic moment though where
Black Bolt has to shout and it's really
loud though and it's destructive

one moment where Black Bolt has to go
ADEs oh jesus fucking christ and then if

right hey rim rim let's head to this
city because we're not gonna make it to

interrupt aids right
alright let's loot this city and and
find a vehicle and pick up our friends
see you're all you're all yelling about
your ears this is why I am the perfect
black bolt I have that power in real
life I would love to argue with you but
you are absolutely correct
oh yeah I'm just I'm just grabbing
grabbing what I can and then I will I
will try to be with you and find a car
of some sort see if there's any down the
road here I'm at work right now wearing
headphones and people are now giving me
weird looks that's the risk that's the
risk you take you knew the risks once
know what I'm watching she's very
concerned yeah she should be as J
watched a published G stream no no I
don't believe so probably not something
he'd be too interested in honestly okay
well then you can head out oh nice hold
on up where are you oh I see down that
road I thought I saw movement be careful
thrown this remind that Jeep run went
done that with one of those alleys I
couldn't make out where for sure but I
thought I saw movement there might be
I don't have I only have a shotgun so
we're not doing super great on items but
let's get to our friends
oh yeah I mean these are the toughest
decisions you have to make thank you
potent potables I want to point out that
somebody was pointing a gun at your head
I see that all right here I'll run it
now that I'm here you go back for potent
potables hi I'm just gonna run there's
an there's another road coming up yep
yep head towards the road there in the
road a lot where we'll make it we got it
we have a full minute before the circle
starts to close okay wait so the winner
of the solo pub gee he got stuck in a
crack and that's how he won how did he
win yeah we're doing great we're doing
great
there's gonna be a great run this is
this is gonna be a running kind of run
where we're just going to be running
yeah someone in the chat was getting
upset about running through an open
field Oh what are you gonna do you got
to get to the same area
you can't teleport
yeah what are your other options it's
not a magical series of alleys you can
safely go through well right like do you
want also I could take my time I could
try to you know go from cover to cover
but the circles fucking closing shit oh
great great now we got something
that's fucking teamwork right there
great great great your blue channel says
with the latest YouTube controversy of
putting more restrictions on revenue
while allowing a legal 24/7 live streams
of TV shows do you think anything will
throw in it as the website for online
video not anytime soon what are the more
restrictions on revenue things that
they're they're adding a questionable
content if you if if someone Flags your
videos for having like content like
advertise advertiser unfriendly content
so just anything you don't agree with
you can flag their video you can and
it's but it's really easy as a creator
to ask for a review and then they
actually do a manual review but it
sounds like a headache it's a bit of a
headache but sounds like a lot of a
headache
well beta the the idea is they the how
YouTube makes its money is through its
advertisers not through its creators and
so they're trying to create a space for
their advertisers to feel welcome and
not run away and that's how we make our
money to is with advert to advertisers
right and so but like for example if
someone had a five minute long video
that was the you know that was a
dramatic plea for Nazism and your Pepsi
you don't want your ad running on that
video well right that would be bad and
so you're like Pepsi why is your ad
running on a video for Nazism and so
YouTube has created a system to help its
advertisers stay away from questionable
content the downside is yes
anyone can get flagged we need we need
better weapons why don't we loot these
houses people people have tried to say
that we all that not prereq but rlm yeah
our alt right hate speech jack
right people have tried that of course
and you know there
wrong and that's where you have a manual
review system again it's not it's not
perfect that's kind of thing that could
conceivably open up the door for another
video service to come in that isn't as
crazy yes and people have tried there
there was one that that tried to like to
be like more open-minded towards
creative content and you know we're not
gonna tell you what you can say but it
became a deluge of pro-nazi hey then no
one wanted to go to the website because
there was just Nazi videos and I still
think that witch has a reason yeah I
still think that twitch has a reasonable
claim to the better alternative but it's
just not there yet they don't have the
numbers that YouTube has YouTube has all
the numbers use must get 1,000 views per
week on the specific video you want a
review of kill smaller channels it can
again the system is certainly not
perfect but it's what we got the I've
said this time and time again us as
content creators are utterly disposable
in the eyes of YouTube and so they are
protecting the people who give them
money we we are replaced with people
uploading videos of their cats you know
I'm saying I never got to the point
where the only videos you could monetize
on YouTube were cat videos yes
that does open the door for something
else to come at absolutely absolutely
absolutely
all right whereas where's the
motorcycles at
oh okay I get I see what's going on here
no no I'll go by myself that's fine yeah
you lead the way then okay how do I
leave don't leave the way oh where the
hell yes oh hell yeah
we're the fucking photo booth you're the
cat videos Oh meow motherfucker the tail
examples bite you're the Hells Angels
won't you
what's going on okay eyes open just ease
to the waffle irons great all right I'm
gonna get the motorcycles I'm gonna
bring them in and I'm gonna distract
them it's gonna be great it's gonna be
great I'm gonna go full Mad Max it's
gonna be great rich
I'm gonna get close I'm gonna drum nope
I'm gonna die

the old TMNT continuity was still a
thing back then too known for the big
city huh oh yeah let's do it

awful there and like non-existent in
Milwaukee

crazy exciting credit where do it was
exciting mm-hmm oh yeah all right Gabe
Lee says hey fellas
my friend just made me watch et for the
first time last week it was great yes
just wondering what required viewing
movies have you guys most regrettably
not seen yet the thing yep yeah like
there's a lot of classic movies that I
don't watch just because I don't care
but a lot of people like oh no it's
required
I think it's horseshit they're not
leaving anybody the other person is dead
yeah Hamid died unfortunately he will be
remembered
everybody trailing us you got a car why
don't you find just some small little
building and defend in the middle of
nowhere
what oh no let's go there that sounds
great
whoa six kid the rain skid yeah nemesis
the best movie ever would be a buddy cop
drama starring Cameron Mitchell as the
chief and Christopher Walken and Jeff
Goldblum as our star cops against the
drug ring ran by Courtney Love oh my god
yes so like if it's Christopher Walken
and Jeff Goldblum like what's the title
of that what are you saying funny
talking cops well I I just I just can't
uh I can't uh what what is this oh this
place looks awesome
this place looks great yeah we got a
shotgun and shotgun shells down here
though Jack took the shells there's a
level one helmet up here that's right
take it crazy Elvis says have you guys
seen the Neal Breen film fateful
findings is currently on that's me sorry
sorry
everything's fine it is currently on
Amazon Prime and is showing up on my
recommended list after watching samurai
cop we're gonna get to it we'd like to
get this more Neal brief built Neal
Breen films sooner rather than later we
have we have voiced our opinion to the
powers that be
that that we require more Neal brained
someone's bad this roof
oh yeah people have definitely been here
armor knowing what's his name
Amir Siobhan Oh a mere yeah that sounds
right
j/k blunt man says hey guys when the
process of watching all of the video
nasties ass jay and just saw the tool
box murders it was terrible but some
amazing drunk Cameron Mitchell scenes uh
best of the worst candidate maybe yeah
maybe anything's possible
we have so many movies well weird you
know obviously weird we're never going
to get to them all yeah we just need a
few months happy no that's not up to me
and you know what I'm fine if we talked
all right do you guys need any bandages
or first-aid kits I have an abundance as
this has the house but has the big
mansion been cleared my Crozier shotgun
I feel like I do better with micros
these yeah yeah where are you okay I'm
coming Jake a blunt man says hey guys if
you could bring back a classic TV show
what would it be also if there were a
God would you prefer an old man with a
white beard or an omnipresent vapor
creature love yous guys I have no
preference and what the God would look
like but you get to choose I don't
necessarily want there to be a god I
just want there to be an afterlife which
one which one gets me a paradise in
eternal paradise which one is that I
can't have one without the other rich
gotta have one making arbitrary laws for
you to follow or else or else it's it's
you know who or else paradise gets
overpopulated with dickheads and it's no
longer parent kind not have an
omniscient gub that's watching literally
everything I do know that's all of the
time that's here's the problem that's
what the gods into he wants to watch he
wants to watch it all so can't have one
without the other oppressor that's nice
I'd rather have an other life instead of
an afterlife
I mean reincarnation no that's just
that's the same as death to me just
erasing everything you are
means everyone in your life that you
what reincarnation reincarnation means
that everybody you love and care for in
your life they're they're worth nothing
they'll mean nothing to you Sunday
she'll be someone else right that's the
reincarnation to me is very depressing
in that in the pink house to the to the
northwest
then you won't remember rich I won't be
me either I may as well be flat-out dead
dead
oblivion bed
anybody see anything
as far as the bring back oh he's on the
roof
wait for wait for Jack wait for it
I'm waiting wait for it
Wow shit
shit I did not have the right gun for
that situation but that's fine that's
that's the importance of a sight of like
a red dot sight right there
what if we end up like a serial killer
in the next life a completely different
upbringing different genetics mm-hmm
maybe maybe in the next life you're a
sociopath without emotions and remorse
right reincarnation is horrible I'm
waiting for them
did you see them leave that house
no I've been checking the stairs I don't
see them in the house currently how many
of them are there it's probably not
worth it for just it's probably not
worth it for Jack to engage anybody
honestly
people dunno I don't actually have
diabetes right no I don't think people
know that okay
I think people genuinely think you have
diabetes and we make fun of you for it
yeah yeah as far as what I'm going way
back as far as which classic TV show
would I bring back Peter Gunn just
because of the theme for that reason
alone well see if I can peter Agana
nobody's heard of a show Peter Gunn but
theme song has far outlived the show
which was unmemorable shit
maybe it was just a straight-up shooting
it back oh no there's another stairwell
over here and stay in a room and so you
don't have to
not that room either is no can't go on
that bedroom it's great I'd love to see
somebody yeah yeah they're busy right
now so I'm hoping I can get the drop on
somebody because of Spy Hunter the theme
was also pretty damn good and prominent
in the Blues Brothers oh yeah that's
right
where is everybody I know they're out
there
I'm surprised that rich hasn't seen Buck
Rogers since I haven't not all of it I
bet you seen a little bit of punk
Rodgers how do you see him you're a
crazy person
okay fair you know what fair enough
favorite film set the dystopia chat why
would you even ask when you know that
Mad Max fury road is the thing does that
count as a dystopia yeah absolutely
and he's still doing that I thought I
thought that that was like a false rumor
but George Miller said he was just done
with it but I've been wrong many times
many many times
dang it right and how far are you far
enough how long one minute
yeah how long do you think it'll take
you to get there no you might be the
last one in you don't want to be behind
other people you have to time this and
your motorcycles are probably gone yeah
there's no people here
oh fuck yeah there take the shit real
quick yeah but I think there's a person
over there
well Allah no no no I'm just counting
I'm gonna Scout rich I can I can do this
shit all right do I have any no I don't
great
I see him I see him over there I got
some good shots on him though okay damn
it
okay new team thanks guys
thanks guys I know I was trying to leave
my shots later but it's gone
everybody steam messaging me be on
stream yeah alright no new so not a mrs.
rich any chance she could do some
backseat gaming a sunny bonds yep
I feel like Sunny's no-nonsense attitude
and blunt criticism could demoralize
Jack into being slightly more effective
at this game oh I I don't want to be too
mean to Jack no I was an asshole to you
last room oh you you know what you were
and I did some research hold on for a
second who's a invite invite there we go
doctor smoke trees it coming Oh Susan
doctor smoke trees we got there come on
big pain come on in there we go that's a
great team let's go okay so yeah my
point to multiplayer games on the
Nintendo 64 versus multiplayer games on
the computer there that they were easily
a more accessible oh god more people
more people were playing them right and
so I did some digging into the numbers
and I found an article written about
quake it was it was about an article
about quake 3 coming out yeah like oh
the numbers are gonna be great and the
article was in 2000 and they were
talking about quake 1 and quake 2
selling like five hundred and six
hundred thousand copies which was a big
deal at the time for computer gaming but
at the same time the n64 was selling
four million copies of Mario Kart and 2
million
that everybody was doing that a
split-screen what I mean what makes you
sure everyone was doing the multiplayer
aspect of those games who knows I'm just
saying like we're talking we're talking
numbers that are well beyond you you had
some something like there were no good
multiplayer something-or-other on PC as
compared to Nintendo 64 like if you come
if you compare the numbers okay and a 64
to PC team who needs who needs to come
on here big pain big pain let's go here
we go again again I'm not I'm not
pooh-poohing PC multiplayer games but I
think there were more people there were
more people playing split-screen
multiplayer than there were playing PC
online multiplayer and and I and so
that's the point
epic Jason you are not the only person
who appreciates quake 1 as a
single-player experience I'm just saying
though that that was the area that
birthed the deathmatch discounting that
for like the split-screen experience on
the Nintendo 64 where do the the numbers
I'm just talking about the numbers more
people were split screening
hey everybody let's have some fun
James is that you hey buddy how's bumble
coming well glad you could take some
time and play with us
great for those who couldn't hear James
is working on the legend of Bumbo which
is related to the binding of issac what

this December which is coming out in
December shit yeah

another wait for spawn issue executive

heard of this happening where every once
in a while like you have to wait for

looking for guns oh great perfect you

great you guys doing great is that
actually James ed the devil it is
actually James II the dev you are you
are a famous games developer James did
same famous on the internet is still
Fame it just usually comes with less
money than the other types of fame less
money and more hassle have you had death
threats from making a game really
I'm so sorry James yeah
the best yeah great
probably not sure where let's see I mean
I would say I don't know if there's any
reason to do anything other than maybe
hunker down in the woods hi guys fine I
stopped so you need some more you need
some more Luton honestly if we murder
people that's where you get the good
leaves so their murder alright
everyone's died with a shitload of med
kits I didn't have a chance to use yeah
yeah that that game I was talking about
where I got like 6 legit kills yeah I I
think I had but what is what is the
better one the med kit or the Med the
wood the bigger one sure I'd like three
of those four of the regular med packs
or whatever the smaller version is that
a ton of band-aids and just didn't have
an opportunity to use them not at the
end no animal to backpack here
so I got a question for rich yeah this
is an old person question okay I'm
trying to look for someone that sounds
simpler that could play simultaneously
in a playlist with CCR is there anything
that comes to mind reader for Creedence
next weekís here's here's what I got
for you off the off the top of my head
have you ever listened to white denim
know if if you kind of like old-school
er sole fold like swing ashrak okay
they're a more modern band but they said
they sound like they could go with you
know the person to ask this question is
Karen I'm sorry put on your button legs
don't tell me it gets like a wreck near
they like the climax of a show
beautiful that would be like the
audience at the end everyone in chat
right now is google searching ankle
pants went to see primus live Wow
recently have you guys ever seen Primus
lab no fortunately I love Primus but
I've never been able to see him live
when I was I was dragged nearly kicking
and screaming to a Wayne Newton concert
because my grandma not like leaving me
home alone and then I have also seen
Weird Al Yankovic climb in persons and
that's not the extent of it we're not
Yankovic at the time I don't know if it
still does great show
oh yeah like 90 costume changes
and fat was somewhere in the middle I
can't believe that didn't just kill him
from exhaustion because he'd put on the
full fat suit
oh right for that and he's like he
changes he just like quick changes with
the full with the fat suit and
everything he was a sexy polish vampire
yeah he's been around for over 30 years
now and he just keeps me back in that
room and put that helmet on I think
James likes his look yeah good I miss
the son of a gun shots enough I think
they're north okay yeah look over this
hill a bit real quick let me I was gonna
do some pro strats a drop and shit but
I'm not good yeah we can hunker down
here for bed work see where the line
goes
they're gonna push rats a living big
pain walk around and scope everything
out while I'm just ID in the corner
whatever keeps you alive cuz then a big
happy to look and Scout if big tan gets
shot then it's your job to come you're
welcome oh just never helped I'm always
a liability on a pub G team always
sometimes some of my favourite Friday
the 13th moments involve some car
heroics so I don't know sometimes it
pays the help hey car heroics that's a
thing in this - the driving does look
pretty wonky in it and I'm just terrible
well you have the mic for one because
you can't rebind keys for some stupid
reason I tend to play Friday the 13th
with a controller but some games some
games if there's like vehicle sections
and I normally play it with a mouse and
keyboard I might have a controller
nearby just so I could pick up the
controller for like driving section I
might do that
this doctor spoke trees like no longer
with us
is he Duffy is he doctoring right now I
hope that drops on my head field
James you got to get out there and cover
him okay there's definitely high likely
to make like chance that people are
going to be coming for this I Jamie get
get to him for some reason that wasn't
working for me before that's all right
imagine we've get to the tree I'm doing
I already this may have been a mistake
no no they're gonna do as me there I
don't know run for cover
oh yeah now you're super prone alright
please turn down there James Mike it's
cliff we were playing on through through
the game that's something that's for the
audio is coming you can it's my bike
stole
oh no that's perfect James it's great
okay
bandage em animation there was James
James in who you know you can tell by
the name was one of the founders of in
software yeah you don't need that kind
of pressure
yeah I could imagine legal battles yeah
we yeah the indie scene especially it's
like pummeled wind with legal stuff
really not good oh yeah I wish I could
say yes a lot of people the guy into the
indie scene earlier the same kind of
people that would make small businesses
and like like suing wind that got like
close to their icon Co IP sure you know
20 years ago with like a cassette
recorder Netflix Netflix on a cassette
recorder gonna student flicks down it's
a kind of stuff where it's like I made a
no strategy game it's similar to your
strategy game so I'm gonna sue you pal
that kind of stuff it's a shame it's
like no one couldn't really talk about
this no one wants to burn any bridges
with this the people that kind of win
that kind of stop is are the the people
that everybody likes sure the the
winners right the history buffs
absolutely
oh man big pain really hope to zone
favors me nope nope oh it really doesn't
favor you zone hates you hate your face
damn rates worth it
oh yeah what you just gotta move her
gone for the crater I thought you were
gonna be the one to buy it so that was a
terrible joke terrible jokes are the
worst wish I didn't drop my hollow sight
that would be really nice right now
close together like a family
yeah we want to be buried together
awhile really just like the Jonestown
people this time together be together
did you ever hear the audio that final
audio tape it's the crime oh god why
would anyone listen to them it's this
really weird thing where you can hear
like a recording of like a band
underneath us it's like they taped over
something else and you can still hear
part of the old recording so this is
really creepy music while they're having
a discussion about killing themselves
sure and this one this one woman in the
crowd the only one there would sense is
trying to talk Jim Jones out of it and
he's not having any of it
right it's disturbing what tape this is
the final audio recording from Jonestown
before they drink kool-aid cyanide laced
kool-aid
and cheap tip John saintly someone's
here moment the universe soon see it
right here right

case now is we've got some we got some
catching up to do on tips oh well shit
then let's get to tips then ah Thank You
beefcake for reminding me on Twitter
that will be very helpful Jacob what man
says hey guys I have long been of the
opinion that Batman TAS is the greatest
superhero thing of all time including
all comics and other media what would
y'all ranked as the best of the
superhero stuff well that's a very easy
and concise question ya know TAS is up
there Batman the Animated Series I mean
as far as Batman is concerned the top
absolutely absolutely
that was so there was a lot of good
there all superheroes yes it's up there
maybe top 5 but I mean but you're
talking like you're talking about you're
talking about oh like oh this one
particular good run of a comic book
series this one movie
was groundbreaking a TV show a cartoon
someone's fuckin drawing like it this
requires more thought than I can give it
right now
exactly but I will say as far as Batman
is concerned absolutely number one I
would rather watch the animated series
over anything else Batman and I mean I
love the Dark Knight movie yeah but I
think I think I would rather watch that
is like the best representation of the
character absolutely Anonymous's hi
regarding the multiplayer discussion
yeah with every copy of Mario Kart and
gold I sold there was a potential one
two three extra people playing the game
and split screen mode sorry to add fuel
to the fire okay but you don't know that
there were no no you but you can only go
off of sales numbers and I know the
sailors alright alright
anonymous says hi guys question for rich
yep if Jack helped you off a horse would
you help Jack off a horse
multiplayer discussion no no I would not
uh-huh forget it
no would you help Jack off a horse
no that's fine amateur bullshit
Jeng jabber jingles says hi hi Jack hi
rich quick question
what's with the fart noise that plays a
cave good work I believe is that a
subscriber that stuff or is that the
same yeah I think something that's the
same we're gonna put the what the fuck
back what do you got oh we just got a we
just have to fix the volume I still love
it Duggars every once in a while just
yeah thank you

to not recommend pub G so rich won't
think less of him no there are many
games that I mean remember I recommended
fire watch rich really didn't like fire
watch that's legit hey this is what I'm
saying
I've seen many positives in pub G just
overall I didn't like the solar
experience yes I'm just saying it's not
like there's two but there's too much
bad for pub G in solo play for me to
recommend it Hugh Jazz's says thanks for
all the entertainment guys did you ever
try sunless sea its FTL ish with more
pacifist options and better developed
world and lore you could even do voices
highly recommend anyway good night

cute
Ben mochi b85 38 mother fucking months

to play pub G a lot that's okay I
watched people streaming a lot and Jack
playing is highly entertaining keep that
six like like Jerry Lewis I'm doing the
bumbling professor first point there is
I still don't understand Jack's not
recommending it you don't
I still don't just cuz you can't explain
it doesn't mean you didn't like it but
also I think there's more bad than good
okay and then why do you come back to it
I have no idea then it's a recommend no
like I said a lot of games I can take
out we have a unique situation here yeah
where the purchasing of this game for me
is a business expense yeah that
sometimes like for me if I had purchased
this outright and we didn't do this show
I don't I just don't know like I said
I'm in a we're in a weird situation
where because I get paid to play games
sometimes the games I play there's not
that onus of time spent and I have been
slowly not coming back to it and I don't
know I don't know okay Thomas my
bathroom okay says planning to get the
