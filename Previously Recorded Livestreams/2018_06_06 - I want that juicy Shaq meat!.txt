yes any good Shaq foo games
needs a Shaq rap to Jack what I want
that juicy Shaq made
oh you're giving him what there was you
know just give in to the inevitable not
a surprise not a surprise Shaq opt oh oh
oh no we don't want to exit the game to
go to the Shaco pedia what's in the
shackle pedia nothing well yeah it's
tough to unlock I get it you see all
right this is a sidescroller just
straight-up fighting game I have no idea
all right
I have no idea what it is right why are
we playing this what happened well I you
know I had a plethora of other games to
play but then all all of a sudden I
noticed something today as we follow GOG
Gamescom oh gee calm the the online
games just a distribution service that
lets you download your games and there's
no drm involved you want the phone into
a server they just let you own the games
you buy I want to let you know we are
not being paid for this I am glad to do
it because I appreciate I personally
yeah appreciate the surface that GOG
provides em and you've talked about GOG
a bunch apparently by the way GOG is
also a fan of you as in announcing that
Shaq fouie legend reborn is on gog.com
they included a picture of you wanting
that juicy Shaq name they tweeted that
out that's great that's great even even
later making a tums reference and so
they're their true fans
so you know they're true fans which is
great and I know you're a big fan of
gog.com so we figured hey we'll play a
little shack foo and these we can get
some fun out good old GOG I love ya they
don't pay me I'm happy to show from them
it's a service you enjoy I enjoy
chilling for gog.com your little baby
that's that shooing Ben that's just
talking about something you enjoy right
you know the other thing I did speaking
of speaking of people accusing us of
being chills I'm sure they're being
there you think oh why sure I'm sure I'm
sure they're being funny I got accused
of being a shield today because that new
no clip documentary came out on Bethesda
Studio yeah and it's like an hour and a
half
yeah and it's fuckin great it's just the
history of Bethesda studios here's some
games they make some of the early Elder
Scrolls games the early Fallout game did
they pay you to say nice things about it
no I'm just a fan oh then you're not a
shill right I just watched the
documentary today and I said damn this
is really good you all should check it
out people like what a shill yeah come
on yeah
okay so just a side-scroller but but
that but that 2d 3ds to shot side
scroller what doc the youtube channel no
clip makes game documentaries they
they've done some great ones on a rocket
League on doom
they had a great one on kind of a weirdo
indie games of there was a spelunky one
they did a great one on said the project
and The Witcher series one on horizon
zero dawn but basically just amazing
documentaries about games and game
studios and this one was kind of a
history of Bethesda as a as a software
company and it was really good and as
someone who as someone who doesn't play
a lot of Bethesda games you know I've
never I've never played an Elder Scrolls
game ever yeah I have I've gotten maybe
three hours into any Fallout game you
know like that's my extent it was just
such a really it was such a great story
just hearing these people talk about
their influence or not their influences
their process in making the game and how
like oh we made this one game 15 years
ago and that's kind of like how we came
here and here and here is great yeah
they made a final fantasy 14 one which I
also didn't care about but I watch it
it's a good documentary that uh that
Danny O'Dwyer is a fine filmmaker
I feel like Jack would like the
elderscrolls I may or may not have just
picked up Skyrim I'm not confirming or
denying take that thing Jack a shag it's
great I'll show you a Bigfoot
this guy harm is great of course I mean
the the really neat thing was kind of
looking back at their old and at their
like the early Elder Scrolls game that
that arena Elder Scrolls arena looked I
mean it looked adorable but it looked
like doom it looked like original doom
but you have a sword you know and you
could go anywhere in the world it seems
really interesting and and I like that I
like seeing that I tried playing arena
couldn't do it that it looked at me it
looked deep though and then you know the
the documentary goes into Bethesda's
kind of turn into the consoles because
they're there morrowind was an xbox
original xbox exclusive in like kind of
well we've always been a PC gaming
company but maybe we can make it work on
the xbox and it went gangbusters right
right kind of the the start of the whole
Western RPG thing Bethesda
if I remember I'll tell you I'm little 5
get out of their rich oh you did it jack
last to expand SEPs were tonally off
don't you think no I thought they were
great
the last two which expanse episodes you
know they're right now they're they're
kind of I feel like they're midseason
and so they're doing a lot of setting up
oh they're so they got cancelled but
they're still having something finished
airing the current season right okay
okay
they're gonna finish season their
current season before they move over to
Amazon Amazon moves quick uh well
honestly at this point the experience is
a turnkey operation right like all their
crew is there they have all the sets
already just someone needs to pay them
for it and if these OSes fan they're
gonna they're gonna finish him it
doesn't matter what the ratings are nope
they're gonna it pays to be a
billionaire you know it pay it pays to
have a billionaire fan is that is the
moral of the story if you want your show
made just make sure be Zoe's sees the
script
no the was it not not the last
experience episode but the episode
before that when when the the racer goes
into the ring and not to give too much
away was a moment of television in which
I go fought out loud like and that
rarely happened for which in the expanse
there there was a moment in the expanse
where I actually went look good oh not
like a laugh no no no pausing a laugh oh
is that what I I meant like I something
happened in the expanse when when the
racer goes through the ring no spoiler
that something happened so unexpected
and so wonderful that I made a noise
that made no sense because I was so I
was so enjoy I was so enjoying what
happened but no I think it's I think
it's we're about to get weird I feel I
feel like we're about to get real weird
and I like it
I'm into it my my wife read all the
books and she's just excited to see the
books all out yes okay no no no there's
one coming out later to see is it the
last I don't know this thing have an
ending or it's just gonna be on going
forever I don't know I wish I could tell
you but there's there's one coming out
later this year and but my wife at you
know obviously the books are further
ahead than the show so my wife is just
really excited to see how they do the
things cuz she really likes the cast and
how they're portraying all the stuff in
the books but I'm just really excited to
see where the story's going next because
it's a great it's they got they got some
good storytellers there on dad they're
experienced
the master 20,000 says word on the
street is that there are two books left
okay offer they come out there I don't
think they're quite adam george RR
martin levels but were they they'll
never be punished right the the way the
expanse is written so i've been told by
my wife is it's actually two writers and
every chapter is written from a
different characters perspective and so
the two writers each handle their own
sets of characters and because they have
two writers my guess is they can get
them done pretty fast
there's maybe some other problems they
have to they have to really coordinate
well right so they're so they're sure
they end up with the same spot like you
know one of them is just like I have
this idea
oh I want to I want to have a guy that's
like oh actually I already wrote that
chapter eight and you need to make sure
you meet up with me yes probably other
pitfalls probably up together work at an
outline yeah
oh I'm sure they have a method boss fine
I'm sure they have a method but I'm
looking forward to it I think like I've
said this many times I think it's the
best sci-fi show on television currently
and and I'm just excited that they're
gonna keep making them part of part of
that rash of shows that were cancelled
and then immediately not cancelled it
was like that in Brooklyn nine-nine like
now we don't want these anymore someone
else would take them right up that that
used to happen back in the band
network television more often than you
think yeah they would they would just
switch Network yes no a different one
network cancel oh I'm a network we'll
pick it up hmm this would happen fairly
commonly can you think of an example not
off the top of my head Chad like
Gunsmoke right right okay chat give me
an example that I wouldn't hear I would
know about oh you know what that's a
good one Skippy brown scrubs did the
same thing ABC wanted to pick up Star
Trek for its fourth season but NBC had
struck the sense a week prior
so Olmo Star Trek so so because because
they couldn't like they couldn't afford
the new sets like I didn't pick it up
oh sure I guess Futurama did that
without going to Cartoon Network nothing
years in between though yeah then with
the Comedy Central charge oh did they
shit man those are the best seasons I
don't I just don't know I've seen them
all I think I've I think I want to
Comedy Central seasons more than I like
the classic Fox seasons hmm I don't
think we can count Conan O'Brien because
technically a different show because
technically that's a different show you
know I'm I'm yeah I'm thinking of the
turnkey operation where all the sets are
there all the actors all the same people
behind the cameras and then just someone
else is giving them money so I've you
know scrubs is an example I remember
when that was going through when down
who picks it up like it was on NBC and
it switched to ABC or vice versa
oh you know what I you know what I'm
forgetting about I see someone
mentioning the WB aka the CW and I'm
forgetting about Supergirl yeah that was
on CBS for season 1 and then you guess
what you were on WBAL
do you know about the new fantasy
cartoon by The Simpsons Futurama
creators I saw the trailer the what
there's a there's like a new a new
cartoon made by Simpsons and Futurama
people and it's like a it's set in a
fantasy I heard rats on Netflix I think
those are gonna be a Netflix might be
never think it's Netflix mmm
so David X Cohen involved or is it uh
just mad draining this time
I said what do you think could have been
killing the PC we'll get into that we
will get into that you have an issues
real issues with this enemy
I thought Shack food was an old game
Shack foo was a dismal game was that
Super Nintendo yeah
Shack foo was a Super Nintendo probably
probably Genesis - sure
Super Nintendo Genesis and it was very
similar to this it was a side-scrolling
beat-em-up not terrible that I remember
it was just kind of a generic I've never
played it that is the first Czech food
game I played Jack rich how dare you I'm
missing out you've been alive look at
all the stuff you've been missing out on
I remember it not do you have like a
roll or a dodge no of okay I'm guessing
you have some sort of get away quick
button
get out of there
I'd say see if there's a option menu
where you can check the controls stop
drop and roll to dodge where's the world
would I use to roll game
oh is it limited lives interesting Oh
well we're droll is the other joystick
Oh very weird very weird how about some
Michael Jackson's Moonwalker that
interesting I can't roll side to side
you can't roll from up and down what if
you what if you press a direction in
wrong you know what that is rich unusual
right there is that Shack singing well
the volumes low in our TV but probably
our Miller yes I did I actually have
played a little bit of totally accurate
battlegrounds today and it's less of us
I don't know I didn't I didn't find it
that fun it's less of a spoof and more
just like a really cheap version of pub
G this this company this company put out
a kind of a parody pub G game called
totally accurate battlegrounds that's a
free-to-play game for the moment and
it's it's very much kind of like pub to
your fortnight roll roll roll you've
done fun gets done locked
and it's you know it's cute it's it's
free part of the part of the get out of
there get out of there
part of the draw is supposed to be the
wacky physics of totally accurate
battleground but I guess I didn't really
notice any of that in my few game plays
bub
whereas rolls worse than his free pet
piece white nice wide screen
presentation welcome in when I'm walking
I'm all the way in the front right of
the screen and I can't see shit that's
in front of me why are you pulling a
sonic the hedghog that is that is a
perfectly acceptable pet peeve beverage
that is that's meat also pet peeve
why can't you roll front backwards yeah
I can't roll with this work
three mugs you just tell my work that's
gonna be fine hahaha tonight oh my god I
haven't yet rich I haven't yet
downloaded Google Chrome on this cuz I
mean when I when I when I gave us a
clean start on this we've just been
using microsoft edge.you and by the way
when you go to Microsoft edge and type
in Google Chrome in the address bar it
actually gives you a thing here why
Microsoft edge is faster safer browser
to see that yeah when you when you
google or when you clean up when you've
Bing Google Chrome
it says no fuck edge edge oh god
whatever Windows 10 goes at a sleep mode
now it automatically starts edge it's
irritating you
oh yeah my webpage wasn't loading so
it's like I'll just go to Google Chrome
because for some reason I'm using edge
and realized I hadn't even installed
edge
whoopsie dukes
jacqueline i have not you know what
here's why I haven't shown rich the new
into the spider-verse trailer is I don't
think rich will care no I watched the
new into the spider-verse trailer about
five times today and my hype level is is
reaching maximum it looks awesome
I'm really excited what what we've
learned from the trailer rich is that
it's kind of an an older adult Peter
Parker right who is in the same universe
as Miles Morales for some reason and
like like in the comics currently well
it's it's like it's like a spectacular
spider-man is in the universe with
ultimate spider-man who is now in okay
so it's there is clearly across the
universe thing happening because at the
very end of the trailer we see we see
spider-gwen show up that's well that's
no I don't get it they're gonna get it
that's what they're doing they're doing
the spider-verse they're doing a dumb
idea today I'm just not I'm not
interested in the idea I know that about
you which is why I haven't bothered to
show trailer I'm crazy excited about it
though it looks awesome the art style I
think is super interesting and amazing
and as someone who's a fan of kind of
weirdo art styles I'm really excited to
see it in the movie one thing that
bothered me though yeah this won't
matter to rich at all because he hasn't
seen the trailer there's a moment in the
trailer
where the kind of a Peter Parker is
eating a hamburger and it's you know
funny moment they're there at a diner
and Peter Parker doesn't have any money
so he asked miles to just bottom some
money so he's eating a hamburger and
while he's eating the hamburger he's
like you know squishing food out all
over the place and a little bit of the
food ends up on the camera lens
okay and that's something I've always
hated in every movie ever
I always hate when like a piece of dirt
ends up on the camera lens you know
uh-huh
like the camera is not supposed to be
there and if like blood splatters on the
camera lens or a little dirt gets on the
camera lens that takes me out of it I
hate that so anyway that was like the
one part of the trailer I was like wow I
hope they don't do that too much where
they like get the camera involved Jack
hates the camera gimmick I do the eye I
hate I hate when they do that in movies
I don't I don't get the weird jittery
animation just going for a style it's a
weird choice yeah it you know what rich
it is a weird choice and that's why I
like it cuz it's not gonna look like
anything else it's gonna look like its
own thing like in the lego movie they
were trying to look like stop animation
yeah the lego stop animation movies I
got it yeah yeah in the peanuts movie it
was it was trying to look like the old
animated cartoons I get I get it at work
here I absolutely don't understand it or
why they're doing it yeah yeah like I
said I think they're just going for a
style so I'm gonna be I'm gonna be okay
with
I'm just gonna be okay with don't know
why every now and then does the super
dude kills I also don't know so I'm very
sorry I can't help you I haven't been
paying attention to your game did you
see the lego movie - trailer
speaking of Legum like an actual sequel
yeah I don't know that's been long
enough I figure maybe they just
abandoned the project instead of will
just make a whole bunch of other Lego
movies instead that's what I think a lot
of people figured for a while and then
they drop then they drop the trailer on
I'm curious you know looks like a lot of
a lot of similar fundis as someone who
has children I'm very excited about some
of the LEGO sets we might get from it
so that's great no Lord Miller equal No
Deal
Lord Miller are both producing it and
wrote the screenplay for lego movie - so
I don't know where you're hearing that
but there's there's four people credited
for writing the screenplay and Lord
Miller or two of those four people so
and their producers on it so
Lord Miller produced the Ninjago movie
but they didn't write any scripts for
the Ninjago movie it's very possible
that they're only gonna be credited as
characters created by Lord Miller but
right now according to IMDB they're both
credited for writing screener first
screenplay so I think it's more than
that I think it's more than that I don't
know if it's one man who uh that looks
great though I will say one of the one
of the weird things about the lego movie
too
is it seems to be running along a very
similar plot structure as the
wreckit-ralph 2 trailer did you see that
one I know I don't even know they're
doing wreck-it Ralph to give I mean when
is all this coming out it would miss all
of this you've missed every little bit
of like geeky movie news in the past two
days three days since we've streamed all
of this stuff has come out but both both
the record wreckit-ralph 2 trailer and
the lego movie 2 trailer both had kind
of themes of of like the what was the
Sarah Silverman character name in
wreck-it Ralph
I forget the the glitch care yeah I know
I know exactly who but I don't wear the
name but both her and wyldstyle seem to
be like doing the whole like we're gonna
be in the forefront now thing and so
they they they kinda the the trailers
actually look like the stories will be
very similar whether they are or not
it's all different thank God I thought
that was weird just seeing them
back-to-back oh we got a we're gonna get
we got to get Google Chrome set up so I
gotta knock it off to unleash the memes
yeah it i i i worried they're gonna fall
into that like emoji movie trap which
hopefully none of you saw the emoji
movie but it's hot hot garbage and a lot
of it was just like referencing how the
referencing like social media stuff it
was a weird
but let's hope it's better than the
emoji movie you can do it wreck-it Ralph
- you can be better than
Margot why is all this coming out of
once was her who's her Comic Con I
didn't know about yeah
no no actually the that was a joke at
the end of the into the spider-verse
trailer was was spider-gwen shows up and
and kind of older guy Peter Parker's
there and Miles Morales is there and
Myles Myles goes wait who's going Stacey
and older guy Peter Parker says says so
it makes a joke about Comic Con and he
goes what's it what's a Comic Con and
again like the trailer ends so we can
only assume there's gonna be more at
Comic Con they make a Comic Con joke it
all came out and it all came out in the
last three days all of these trailers
came out in the last three days
okay
I got chrome working everything's gonna
be fine so you say so you say oh and
also the bumblebee trailer came out I
didn't even see that what they're making
a Transformers prequel they're making a
bumblebee movie and here's the thing I
have not seen the trailer rich but word
on the street is then it looks pretty
good all right I buy is this a reboot
it's a prequel okay but it's not being
directed by Michael Bay I give zero
fucks I also don't care about the
Transformers in general so I'm just not
up on that I'm just not up on that it's
directed by Travis Knight of Leica
Studios who did two Kubo and the two
strings oh shit now I got to get excited
about it no it's it's the you know CG
and real people but Kubo is really good
oh god damn and now I got to get excited
don't I that gets me a little excited
obligations to be excited okay
at least the the yes well from what I've
seen it looks like the Transformers are
no longer fused together scrap metal
garbage it looks like they actually have
a form and and stand out a little bit
from the background so we'll see we will
see alright we have a David David Dino
people who says hey rich and Jake you
guys should play injustice to now is the
perfect time because it crashed your
last dream what are some of the best
some of your best technical difficulty
stories thanks you've seen them all you
have seen this is a story that I told on
stream before but for anyone who hasn't
told it which will lead into why we're
not playing injustice to tonight one of
my bests technical difficulties stories
happened over Christmas vacation just
this last year when my cranky older
uncle was having some computer issues he
wasn't able to get his internet to work
yeah and and he came to me because he's
like hey you're a guy that knows
computers right like can you help me
with my computer I said oh sure cranky
old uncle I'll help you with your
computer and you know he's my uncle by
the way is not a dumb man he's an
engineer or was he's retired now but you
know he was an engineer smart fella so
he knows a little bit about computers
and so I head over and I start tinkering
with his computer you know I do the
standard unplug it put it back in you
know check the router check all the
connections and you know all the basic
stuff everything is working fine so then
I dig a little bit deeper try to like
get into the internet settings and
everything looks fine and so be
of because of rich Evans and my newly
found knowledge of the internal workings
of computers I was actually able to open
up the computer what was actually
happening with it is the the computer
said that it had no Ethernet card wait
and you know like I opened it up and
there was clearly an Ethernet card
hooked up to the motherboard
yeah but the computer said no Ethernet
card so I said hey let's try this I'm
going to physically take out the entire
Ethernet card turn your computer on plug
it back in so that your computer will
think it's a new piece of hardware and
automatically set it up and because I
have put together a PC I wasn't afraid
to do something like that because I know
how to do it right and I did it and I
put it back in the computer said hey a
new piece of hardware let me get all the
drivers set up for oh yeah here it is
all the stuff and it worked like a charm
so like not only was I able to fix my
cranky uncle's computer problems yeah
although badass oh it looks like super
smart super smart and really all I was
doing was unplugging and plugging in a
different thing but but I got to look
really smart while doing which leads us
into why we're not playing in justice to
tonight which is because this computer
can't handle it I don't know that that's
true it can't handle that and streaming
apparently that well that's that's the
moral of the story and we've been
talking about buying a second a second
computer purely for streaming for a
while yeah excuse me and and doing a
little research most of the information
I've been able to find is tells me that
streaming is pretty CPU intensive it has
to take all that video send it through
the CPU and then you know out to twitch
right
every single bit of video and so then
when you're playing a game which is more
GPU intensive but still uses the CPU it
has to go through the CPU then through
the GPU and then back through the CPU to
stream it right and so unless you're
rocking you know a six core or above
processor you're gonna have a bad time
streaming certain games and playing them
on the same computer so I've ordered all
the parts for a second streaming only
computer nice nice and I'm pretty
excited we just needed something simple
we do is that's true rich and I was
talking with rich as I was you know
getting prices for all this stuff and
rich goes wow I think I really think we
can pinch the pennies and you know maybe
here maybe here and I said we don't need
a solid-state drive right we don't need
a solid-state drive and you know that
case I bet we can find a cheaper case
than that and I said well you know the
case is just for me I want it to look
pretty right right so I'll I'll deal
with the price of the case cuz I do I
want I like it to look pretty I like my
small form case and this isn't a small
form of mine but but uh but basically
rich I blame you for me spending more
money you're welcome because you've kind
of turned me into a snob okay see snob
you're welcome we're it's like we
probably don't need a solid-state drive
but I got one anyway cuz you know why
it's a little bit nicer and everything
just works a little bit faster I did not
look at that I see odd check those icy
hot commercials okay
but you know because it's gonna be a
computer only for streaming I only got
120 gig solid-state drive instead of
anything you know super fancy cuz it's
not like we'll be downloading you know
what we're gonna download one program to
it that's it basically that's it and so
like we don't eat a super incredible
hard drive I did
I got a pretty decent heat sink because
streaming is so processor intensive but
still you know relatively cheap okay did
I not get it it's Jack's final issue
Jack's the one who's looking forward to
putting it together
I said Jack you want me put together of
Jack's like no no I know and I thought
about that I said how would you think
rich might be mad if I put it together
cuz I really want to put it together and
then I said well I'm just gonna put it
together and yeah I'll be fine with that
rich already put together two computers
you've already put together two I've
only put together one right oh beep Kate
getting me into PC building and getting
me into emulators is two very different
battles but no I'm excited to put
together another computer and everything
should be ready for Sunday so Sunday we
should be streaming from our new
computer so hopefully we can we can play
injustice to then and not have to worry
about any glitchy graphical issues you
know the one of the biggest issue was
finding like a motherboard that had a
decent number of USB ports because you
know not only are we gonna have to run
xsplit through it but we gotta plug our
microphones into it we got to plug our
camera into it if we want a second
camera we need another USB thing we got
to plug our stream deck into it there's
a lot there's a lot of things and I
don't necessarily want to use a USB hub
of because that'll just that adds
another point of failure alright so
you probably know PC building stream
just because we've already done that and
I think this will be a a much simpler
build real differences no fancy graphics
card which is going with the on Borg
well and the we're not using it we're
not doing a tiny case this time this is
a it's it's a smaller case but it's not
a super small case I wonder how many
people in the chat are gonna y'all for
going with the onboard graphics we are
going with the with the motherboard
graphics that's true but actually it
looks like the press it's different than
back in my day yeah it looks like the
processor now does the graphics what do
you mean it's being processed on the
process it used to be the motherboard
integrated motherboards the motherboard
oh sure video card work but now
obviously now it looks like the
processor is doing that well but all we
need is a screen to show us what it's
showing on xsplit yeah and so we just
don't need we don't need any graphics
card oh we don't need anything fancy yes
but we know I mean we just need the on
board yeah yeah yeah
I already did a piece of well we have we
have me building a PC from what a year
or so ago and then we have rich building
a PC from about four years ago did you
build your other PCM stream - I think so
I don't think so I think I'm at like
built one on stream oh okay
I've I've built a ton and my wife so
it's not like I've just built - right
right
I've built - since you've known me yes
yes oh and by the way yes Wally Russ 10
asks a very important question which is
if we have a dedicated streaming PC will
we finally be able to stream in 1080p
and the answer is yes no it will no you
know we we should we stream in 720p just
because we don't want to overtax the the
computer but so now with with our new
computer I think we'll definitely be
able to stream @ 1080p no problem no
problem
so yeah we're going we're gonna we're
gonna go up a tick in hd-quality you're
welcome everyone you'll get to see this
and this in beautiful HD yes I got it we
we got an internal capture card I got I
got an elgato just because we used el
gato products and and they work 99% of
the time I did people ask me I did
refurbish Karen's computer but I thought
I royally fucked up the paint job I just
I just I scrapped that I just bought a
normal case cuz I royally fucked up the
paint job
rather than have her wait got my shit
together to gangers yeah yeah yep you'll
get that 1080 pale knees look at this
look at all this need that you get I'm
not super worried about streaming at 60
frames a second true blue review that is
not a concern they're making a they're
making a product placement joke by just
saying the product name over and over
again and it's clearly it's gold Bond
medicated powder it's clearly another
product wings
come on Yemen speaking of a shill he has
a very skirt was rich know about the
sony III weakness because one thing on
that list is definitely gonna hype him
up what what is on the Sony leaked III
list oh I didn't see that I didn't see
the Sony III Lee oh I'm sorry
my fuckin self is that you know what
that was me assuming and that was that
was my fault absolutely oh speaking of
rich do you know that they're making a
battle tech v MechWarrior v yeah thing
they've been making and stop making
until I see something physically see
something I'm not gonna get hyped okay
because I know a lot of comments for our
battle Tech episode was man rich is
really gonna like MechWarrior v now you
know with all his complaints
well as far as an III Street when is III
even do you know usually yeah and yeah
we'll probably do something similar to
what we did last year which is wait
until all the conferences are over and
then dedicate a whole stream just to
looking at trailers and reacting to them
as we do so it won't be it probably
won't be like a live sorry list this
weekend through next week
no one's the company behind MechWarrior
Online is making MechWarrior v
mercenaries and is supposedly it will be
out at the end of the year okay so I
want to see something okay what I've
heard about MechWarrior Online it's got
that shitty customization so that's
that's some anti hype right there sure
sure sure I've seen mostly positive
comments on our Battletech review it's
good a lot a lot of people saying that
they hate to admit it but they even
agree with me which is always a shock
about wish about anything okay but about
battle sack they agree with me and they
say they don't like it that they agree
with me and fun you know they do we kind
of have the same opinions aren't they
agreeing with me too
they're agreeing with you and
begrudgingly agreement agreeing with me
yes which Evans is totally right and I
guess Jack is just it's underwhelming
why is there eight feet of screen behind
me and I'm like one inch from the right
side of the screen why would anybody do
that to be fair you never really you're
never really surprised to run into
anything but it does look weird
aesthetically I agree should be the
other way around yeah I agree I agree oh
you know what actually on that note
YouTube comments I do want to address
something there's something that comes
up a lot is a lot of times people ask
people or people assume how much of the
game we played based on the gameplay
footage that I choose to use in our
episode and a lot of times the gameplay
footage that I use is within the first
couple of hours of the game mostly
because in those first couple of hours
it it does the best job of visualizing a
point that we're making so if we're
talking about a gameplay mechanic
usually early on in any game is when
they give me the tutorial on that
mechanic and so showing a video of that
to illustrate our point is why I do that
also I don't want to spoil too much and
also as I record gameplay footage I
record a lot in the first like
ten hours of the game usually I'll
record the first ten hours and then
after that I'll just record sporadically
so I just have more footage fry I will
flat out at MIT I don't always finish
the game if oh yeah if I if I get bored
Tim if I'm still bored ten hours into
your game you've done something wrong
oh yeah well no and that's that's as far
as I got in Battletech I got ten hours
and I said done because I just couldn't
stomach it in but some people were some
people were complaining like it looks
like they only got a couple hours into
the game because they're using this and
that footage right and you know like
like I'm saying well to be fair we only
it's something that footage - it's
always only your's oh right it's never
mind that's the other thing rich doesn't
record any gameplay footage and so and
so I'm it's like I remember the the doom
review of people like chiding me for
using a scope them know all that footage
was Jack I don't even I don't even know
what the scope on the assault rifle
looks like right right well you know a
little bit of it is is some logistics
where I don't have unlimited harddrive
space and so I make sure I record at
least the first ten hours of gameplay
after that it starts to waver like you
know I run it through an elgato and I
use their game capture software which
does have a a rewind feature and so if
you keep it plugged in in the software
running at any point you can hit a
button and it will record the last five
minutes of gameplay so if anything
really exciting does happen I'll hit
that button but you know
oh he's got some kind of anti foot power
thing okay come anti-flu okay I can't
kick him oh oh you did died he's got
some sort of anti power o P dokey a
hunchback Jack says hey Jack and rich
not to relive past times but did you
figure out what happened to the PC at
the end of your stream just interested
and if you'd rather not talk about it
don't go of the stream well haven't
figured it out no well we're streaming
out now it's fine just I think that that
injustice was to processor-intensive
possibly that's a lot of speculation but
I don't know right that's that's my only
guess is injustice was to
processor-intensive and that end
streaming was too much for the computer
and it buckled that would make sense but
but then and then you know we just got
some residual weakness on Friday the
13th I guess the computer wasn't ready
yet it needed more of a break I don't
think we yeah I don't think we were
started after that I thought well I
thought it shut down automatically I
thought we were restarting then we tried
in justice after it shut down right
right and then we didn't restart for
Friday third yeah that was our problem
yeah okay that's fair rich
so hopefully all those problems will be
fixed with our brand new streaming PC
all the parts are either coming today or
or tomorrow okay that fuck me over real
good oh did I do I did I did something
I'm very sorry okay okay and there you
go that was my fault I checked my phone
I got a little ding and when I put it
back down I accidentally brushed against
the left click on the mouse
oopsie doops oopsie doops
yeah I mean maybe what what how big are
they relatively speaking one of them has
experience fighting even if it's play
fighting there's experience fighting I
know John Cena's probably a really big
dude but Shaq is also fucking gigantic
and he's gigantic in basketball what he
is gigantic in basketball but also he's
he's not a regular player anymore are we
talking I'm okay I am thinking in their
heyday okay both in their heyday yeah I
still might give it okay on one hand if
it was pure physicality I think John
Cena would happen right right if we're
talking a little reality Shaq would win
because John Cena's apparently the
nicest man alive and just wouldn't want
to fight Shaq Ryan I watched the first
episode of this is a YouTube red cartoon
not bad John Cena yeah I didn't know
he's good we've got a space cowboys
cartoon oh yeah yeah space truck and
rope robot oh man everything I've ever
liked I don't pay attention to wrestling
at all but everything I've ever heard
about John Cena is overwhelmingly
positive he's just the nicest person
jack is literally one foot taller than
John Cena
sheshank is giant but again even even in
his heyday oh come on you you get an icy
hot to regain your health that's fine
that's Jack just notices this I
shockingly I haven't been paying
attention to the game very much I'm
sorry
yeah I'm sorry okay let's see here
Oh brave Sir Robin says I have an
important decision you guys Tommy Wiseau
and Greg Sestero are touring with some
weird new movie called best Marines best
friend it seems that seems yes however
at the same time another theater is
showing the original unrated Robocop
which I've never seen
unrated Robocop hands down the the new
tummy Wiseau and Greg sestra movies
gonna be deliberately bad mm-hm and it's
gonna be horrible yes it's not gonna be
funny like the room is right it's gonna
be someone trying to be funny and
they're gonna be bad and trying to be
funny so it's just going to be bad
Robocop is going to be the Unrated
Robocop on the big screen done that's an
easy decision my friend Tommy Wiseau has
been in on the so bad it's good joke for
too long he can no longer make another
the
right true blue review a lot like if you
if you've seen samurai cop - they were
just - in on the joke yeah yeah and so
it's just not the same yes samurai got
to terrible yeah yeah
so no take that time go see Robocop on
the big screen I wish it actually you
know like I know some people who do who
set up like special screenings I'm gonna
talk to them like let's give a Robocop
on the big screen that would be awesome
I have never seen Robocop on the big
screen
right king Vidya you know what's up it's
so sad that time I also realize the joke
I think he had another room oh yeah if
if he would have had you know like some
mild success with the room but but no
one told him about the joke he could
have easily you know made another movie
and just thought he was a successful he
could have dreamed it but but some
somehow he became self-aware I don't
know how but somehow Tommy Wiseau became
self-aware did they talk about that in
the book at all about in being
self-aware him being self-aware of the
so bad it's good thing no they the book
ends when the movies done Oh
breehn happily maintains his self
delusion absolutely sinnerman which is
why Breen is fantastic Breen continues
to think that he's saying something
is he really self-aware though I feel
like he thinks he is good up the the
process troll is self-aware well and and
the problem is even if he thought he was
good he no longer has any incentive to
be good
he has incentive to be bad because
that's what he's known for
and Tommy Wiseau makes money which is
why he tours constantly with the room
which is why he was really excited about
them making biography of him in the room
like he mark my words best fiends is
gonna be horrible and not not like
horrible like the room is horrible
horrible like it's completely boring to
watch Corbett
yeah yeah yeah mark mark maga damn words
if if I were a betting man that's what
I'd put money on yeah absolutely
that's what I would put my money out
so Oh brave Sir Robin takes some time C
unrated Robocop and have a great time
have a great time
try to get it to play here in Milwaukee
if again if you have any say in now we
make some calls I'll make some calls
later hey hey let's make that happen
unrated the 17 he only says hey guys
since I found out how to tip I cannot
stop giving you hacks my lunch money
thanks for the stream PS my username is
pronounced the one the only then why is
it the 17 he only misses 7 supposed to
be it's a it's lead speech oh don't want
I guess I can see that
alright well next time lead with I don't
think anybody can be blamed for reading
that a 7
wladim you are I don't know that do you
know cool cat saves the kids we have no
I died haven't seen that one so I don't
know about that director or them being
self-aware I'm sorry
I haven't watched it but we have like
seven copies okay well there you go well
there you go
nope yeah okay
I am sad that Dark Souls remastered is
20 bucks even if you own the game wasn't
there a deal III thought there was a
there was a pre-order deal if you if you
already own Dark Souls and then
pre-ordered remasters you got it for
like 15 on Steam at least I don't know
I'm still very stubbornly waiting for my
switch copy I wanna I wanna I want it I
want to take some time and really dive
into Dark Souls right and I'm looking
forward to that and you know I of course
I own Dark Souls you know the original
dark so what's what's the difference
between this and the PC version wife
with the fan-made patch whatever the
fuck it is what what I have heard is a
lot of what Dark Souls remastered is is
basically just pre-installed dsfix yes
okay that's what I've heard I don't know
exactly you know some graphical updates
here and there a more consistent frame
rate you do get a solid 60 frames a
second in in Dark Souls remastered so
so but I do want to I want to take some
time and really get into it which is why
I want a switch version so I can know I
can play it wherever I am and it's been
just it's been delayed to oblivion
delayed to nebulous later this year
forever zone yeah oh it's $40 regularly
and $20 if you don't own the original or
if you do owe me a beta version
okay great I get $40 for something
that's free on the PC well no you step
to buy Dark Souls how much can you buy
dark so far and PC five bucks probably
pretty - okay five dollars on DC I'm I'm
sorry I'm sorry for getting that wrong
you know what you know I'm saying you
can time stands you know saying okay
let's see here a box thai beatnik says
there's multiplayer updates more summons
invaders weapon level matching etc okay
oh and now they're saying they pulled
the old switcheroo and everyone rich the
original is no longer available on Steam
Oh fucking bastards so unless you
already bought it you got to buy the
remaster why just don't - oh I own the
original I guess I assumed you own the
original as well I don't know
and they're saying they're saying
there's a lot of quality of life
additions just be a smoother things here
and there but forty bucks I'll just wait
I'll wait so that comes to the switch
patiently
there's other games I can play
gig one wants to know if we played
witcher 3 s DLCs heart of the stone and
wine and blood I could say the same no
because you haven't played with your $3
I have played a bit of Witcher 3 and
really enjoyed it but but fell out of it
other stuff started taking taking my
time and though I really really enjoyed
my time in Witcher 3 I was I was having
a heck of a time really getting into the
world getting into the story getting
getting into everything I thought it was
really great
I really should pick that up again one
of these days but there's always
something price is original Dark Soul so
you buy the original and get the
discount on remastered or I get to just
have the original and use the dsfix band
patch right and I bother with the BS
remastering that's something a fan did
for free I don't know I just assumed not
get ripped off
Chinese Chinese it's just nature isn't
that good I kind of house kind of bored
stops playing to Adam I mean if this is
you know if I'm going to if I'm gonna
have an epic first world problem right
here it's it's part of the nature of
this show and our schedule is I have to
play game sometimes I have to play other
games yeah other than the game I want to
play and I really think left to my own
devices I would have spent all of my
game time in Witcher 3 and gotten
significantly further shit
that did suck but you know I had to move
on because we were playing other games
and okay when I went to you know after
after playing Richard I'm sure I'm sure
it was something we we did
I recommend installing the leveling mod
so you can breathe through the combat
and get to the fun story stuff no that
was like that was part of the fun for me
in Witcher 3 was was was you know
running into an enemy and then realizing
I was severely underpowered and having
my ass handed to me that's always the
best part of games like that is just
learning where you are and saying you
know what I'm gonna go take care of some
of the shit I'm gonna get a better sword
I'm gonna I'm gonna get stronger and I'm
gonna come back and kick your ass
which lady that's the fun part of games
like that is is running into an obstacle
that you can't surpass and then having
to come back and then when you come back
and kick their ass it's it means
something it's something special
how many games have you hated and played
for prereq purposes anything I give a
bad review to you guys have seen the
episodes oh I had a bad time playing
battle tech I really did not like battle
that guy was incredibly bored I I had a
really bad time playing playing God of
War that was that was not my jam right
there
o.o Metal Gear survived I put way too
much time into Metal Gear survive oh man
that was a bad one too because that game
sucks
what else what else we do recently we've
got something in common
let's not forget 1886 here we're playing
this on my PC the PC is not dead here's
the thing yeah I actually the order 1886
was so short I didn't have the
opportunity to hate playing it yeah that
didn't kill any of my time because it
took six hours to complete the entire
game yeah like we got done with that too
fast we finished it on stream right
like I guess I play a little I was room
oh shit we're done I know we're here
before the stream and I was like yeah I
think we're close to the end why don't
we just I would just push through we'll
finish him yeah yeah I was that was
crazy so like I I just did there there
was not enough of the order 1886 to get
like it didn't wreck my day actually I
really liked about it was that short
because that meant we could get the
review done fast yeah yeah I did not
have a good time playing alien isolation
there's a lot of games that it didn't
have a good time playing you know
serious metal detecting no I was
actually way too into series metal once
I was legitimately into that and I don't
know why but that scratched an itch for
me man just beep beep beep oh like that
that and viscera cleanup project I tried
to get rich to do a to do an episode on
this or a cleanup project and rich just
flat-out refused relax and do some
chores and clean up the space station I
wanted it so much I'm like rich we got
to do this we got to do an episode on
viscera cleanup detail if it worked if
it weren't years I would have been more
into doing it but it was it's all new oh
I know but it's so great Oh
loved it so much I loved it so fucking
much so is there a game you wanted to
play yeah there is are you done I'd be
the boss great I think we could switch
now okay yeah there's a game I can play
yeah but I know I know house flipper is
supposed to be very similar to that very
similar to that except for you get to
design in your own house I think I
suggested that for a first four hours oh
that might be a fun first four hours of
a game one house flipper oh yeah yeah
supposed to be it's supposed to be neat
hope the gog money was worth it GOG he's
paid me nothing as I've said I she'll
them for free because I truly appreciate
that they made games available without
any drm bullshit attached to them mm-hmm
that is that is that is worthy of my
shilling for them for free mmm-hmm house
flipper is another chore simulator
strapped in right well if we just do the
first four hours of ask for free games
that's when you cross an ethical dilemma
once they start giving me shit right
then it's shilling so I don't want I
don't want free things right from GOG I
don't want it for diccon we didn't we
did know that that's said the project
owns good old games actually I only
discovered that because of the no clip
documentary so it was great anything you
have to know I'm not getting paid to
shell anything i we we talk about
things where we enjoy things we hate in
here and you know I will I will I will
gladly shill for other people on the
Internet whose shit that I love and so I
will shill for noclip as long as they
keep making excellent documentaries and
they just happen to be doing that so
they're nice people over access games
yes the deluded X come remember the name
of the game they wanted to give us they
wanted to give us a copy of the the one
in space Oh what was it called it was it
was like so it was like civilization but
in space and it was called someone in
the Chad's gonna know it here's here's
the thing here's the thing to do that
yeah and my first Oh meat-free shit and
that I thought about it what if I hate
the game
oh I'm gonna feel terrible they've been
so nice to me gonna have oh I feel
terrible if I didn't like the game when
I and then it was like oh I can't accept
this sure I knew no we can yeah no they
were really nice yes and and so yeah
that's fair that's fair cuz you're right
like once you start like well and it's
it's like different that there are there
are like third party companies that will
send out like review keys to people and
we're on a few mailing lists yeah so we
get a review key here there and
sometimes I'll check out a game to see
if it's a good game to stream or to do
for an episode but those are usually
handled by like third party publicists
companies and we're just on lists like
we don't talk to anyone personally so so
yeah beyond Earth that's what it was
called welcome to earth
we I you know I got one of those
recently I played a game even a bad
review is exposure yeah but it made me
realize that it would have affected my
ability to be completely impartial I'd
have oh I feel guilty I never that
little guilt yeah yeah but a maybe I
would have been a little soft on it I
couldn't do it it was a line that rich
didn't want to cross not saying that
crossing that line is unethical but rich
just didn't want to cross it of course
because they give review copies out all
the time that's part of the business but
you know rich just doesn't want to cross
that line which I have to respect
stellaris oh that might have been it I
don't remember which one it was
yeah
ya know and I think that's fine I asked
for him the what was the game I was
playing earlier just just to get this
out of the way have you guys played rich
have you heard of a game called cultists
simulator you've mentioned it once I've
mentioned it once oh yeah when we were
talking about what what game you scream
on I was like oh yeah I got this key for
this game maybe it's supposed to be like
slay the spire oh yeah yeah yeah now
remember you talking about it's a card
game where you try to grow a cult okay
okay so here's what I can tell you about
cultists emulator I have played the game
for three hours yeah deep concentration
like I am ready to learn this game
because I thought it might be a fun
stream game because we've had other card
games on stream that you know slay the
spire like all those work out great okay
huh so I started playing I have three
hours of hardcore playtime into the game
I cannot describe to you how to play the
game I don't understand
core gameplay mechanics of the game
after playing it for three hours that's
the same it's insane it's it's very it
well it's it's a it's what I'll describe
it as arty-farty FTL because what it has
is you you get certain cards and certain
cards need you get cards and then you
get like little diodes that you put the
cards into and then certain diodes
require certain cards and then it's in
that diode for like 60 seconds right and
then at the end of 60 second either
something good happens or something bad
happens then different diodes show up
that you need to put different cards
this is real time it's a real time thing
but much like FTL at any time you can
pause there's an in-game pause button
and you can read each card look at what
it does
think about what you're gonna do then
you move the cards and unpause and then
timer start to click and then more
diodes show up and then more cards need
to go in more places and I swear to you
I don't understand a damn thing about
the game
all right it's it is the most insane
thing where I like I I like to learn
about a game only through playing the
game like I don't like it when I have to
go to another site and like oh you're
supposed to do this and do this like a
like one of those like a game facts or
whatever right and I have honestly just
tried my hardest to understand core
gameplay concepts of cultist simulator
and I got nothing
yeah fucking nothing it seems like a
neat idea
nope I have no friends reference here
krinkle Krunch says put another 10 hours
into it and you'll understand about 40%
of it it's really part of the fun is
unraveling it I could see that and like
that's why I like this is not a
recommendation or a condemnation of
cultist emulator I'm just telling you
where I am with it and it could be
really fun figuring it out maybe that's
part of the gameplay is just understand
you know understanding it but but I I I
don't I have no concept after three
hours so that's it that's all I got okay
that's what I needed to tell you about
you know helps us to simulate we had a
we'll be back don't we have a we'll be
back but not here
we should have a will be there no we
don't
we will be back okay so then we will
just click here and then and then we'll
mute it too
did you just did you just unmute the
