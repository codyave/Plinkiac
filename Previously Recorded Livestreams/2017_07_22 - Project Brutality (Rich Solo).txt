Saudi weapons bound to the same button
who's all right here's here's a 1-1
weapon slot one weapon slot that's
that's for fucking weapons I don't know
that there is an option to bound those
separately I didn't notice one there was
only nine weapon binding options fucking
one two three four five six seven eight
nine and zero

rustles whoa
where's that exploding thing no not bad
not bad
Oh
those are some really neat though
Barents those are some really neat
looking Barrens all right what's going
on to the check you're talking about the
Fantastic Four movie ah you talking
about like Marvel getting the rights
back at this point what could Marvel
could Marvel save the Fantastic Four at
least far as uh the cinematic universe
is concerned it's a little bit late to
be introducing them it's a little bit
late in the game it's kind of weird
they announce that the Fox announces
solo doctor all those desperate
motherfuckers fantastic for other pretty
damaged at this point they're pretty
damaged they save smarter we haven't
people love spider-man people wanted to
love a spider-man movie people don't
give a fuck about Fantastic Four look at
Jack
they don't give fuck number one
ah we're so gonna die
we're
we're gonna die I'm going to do it three
years ago
whoo first time you've caught us live
who's that pick plastic John I'm sorry
it's ripping solos dreaming they always
suck I never talked enough never talk
enough during my solo streams rich do
you care at all about the Spiderman
animated series I've heard good things
about it spite never really getting into
it which one which one I'll tell you
this much the spectacular spider-man
cartoon is amazing
I guess that's almost ironic but not
quite I didn't care much for the 90s one
deal with it I know that I know that
shows got its fans I'm not one of them
like some goons weapons but there's an
accessible
it takes me an hour to find the weapon
iwami
because you have to have the same chemo
at the time switch through the different
machine guns
try the doom 64 port not tonight I don't
know that I'm gonna do this all night
because this is kind of mentally
exhausting but there's something else I
wanna give a shot tonight
I'm not good at this I'm not good at
this
you guys talking about now fine about
Josh plays great in the the Martin
review with Jade as a that was a fine
episode of reviews
it's a loving tribute to George Romero
what works
all right we'll save let's say well it's
kind of low but we'll save
eighteen bullet 17 torturous
alright alright save I was saved was
saved
we did not die we should have we got we
got nothing we are we are low on
everything
we are so fucked so fucked
I don't want to disable that putting on
the helmet animation
oh wow we're fun one fireball away from
death
probably not playing up till tonight
you wanna know my thoughts on the madmax
game what we streamed in a number of
times
I enjoy it though I'm not gonna lie a
lot of that's because of the license if
that were generic wasteland adventure I
would not give two shits about that game
so I like that game on those strengths
and license it's a fine just kind of
generic game not offensive it's not it's
not wholly original there's that
terrible like mimics drive around is Mad
Max drive around a barren wasteland is
madness that's fine
that's what I paid my money for it's
what I got
do it why did it switch away from the
shotgun
am i completely out of fucking ammo for
the shotgun too
I did not just burn through 50 slugs
buckshot they want buckshot wait
style no we didn't we just kind of ran
in there and died almost immediately Oh
almost immediately
Jim sucks fuck it was I have a weird
combination of mods and difficulty
settings going on it's on me
it's probably on me god I wonder game
and blame myself
yeah I couldn't shoot him because it was
going through the fucking is what I know
how about animation oh that's sucked
she's
this is the brutal doom starter pack wad
you really need some help
it's hard to quickly switch between the
weapons you want because too many guns
are bound to the same key I'm gonna call
it a huge flop in project brutality
how many more tries do I give this
before we we get sick of watching me die
on this on this stage
what one more time and on a hundred more
times huh - two more times what's the
deal are people hating this are people
hating this what's the verdict what's
the verdict
I need the verdict what's what's the
verdict
what's what's the verdict
I'm gonna try between one and a hundred
huh I'm gonna split the difference and
do it two more tries that's somewhere in
between
one that was that was one
without - I'd died two more times
yeah yeah all right it doesn't doesn't
let me start with just the pistol and
full health no you're not gonna do that
all right all right
great good nope so just before all right
let's say what you can all take a break
and watch this newer trailer you're
talking about from San Diego comic-con
