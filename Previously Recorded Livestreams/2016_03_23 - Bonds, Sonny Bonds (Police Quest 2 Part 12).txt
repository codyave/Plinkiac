and that you're talking about a movie
called the twist and I was very really
like the twist
what the hell I've never heard of that
movie I've never been too fond of the
plot hole no that's all right take your
time think think of it think of a movie
I laughter I have to bring up the the
face sheet anyway I'm just gonna start
the fucking game well wait one more
question that's very important yeah have
you been have you seen any daredevil yet
literally just like the the first 10
minutes of season 2 before or something
come up I had to go so I started I
started today okay
I'm not done yet I'm only like nine
episodes in which means I'm close to the
end
mm-hm so you know the one thing I will
say about daredevil I am enjoying it is
the internet I tried to stay away from
all the spoilers but the internet was a
tizzy about like do you remember in
season 1 they had the one-shot fight
scene right the hallway fights was a
great fight scene fucking amazing fight
scene right and they're like if you
thought that was crazy there's this
other thing in season 2 that's gonna top
it and either I haven't gotten there yet
or it did not even come close to topping
it because I've been waiting for it like
where's this awesome fight scene and the
fight scenes have been alright but
nothing is near that hallway fight scene
you know I think I'm just gonna spend
the whole second season mourning for the
makeshift costumer you know he's in full
costume now yeah full new costume I like
it
wait what is that I hear us I was
probably the probably my web browser has
the yep has there we go that has the
stream open that's a wait I was weird
yeah okay
that's what it was
VAR er I'm not gonna tell rich basically
you're unimpressed oh my god they they
overhyped a way overhyped
that would that fight sequence was not
nearly as cool as the hallway
exactly exactly our Miller I'm with you
entirely that way if that's supposed to
be the breathtaking fight scene dude
rich the rich have no expectations about
an amazing fight since it's just
something in the chat most stairwell
there's the state apparently that's it
okay there we go have no expectations
over hazel we've not played salt and
sanctuary yet that'll be our next game
once we're done with with the police
quest the makeshift costume added a dose
of believability doit of realism to it
and it looks cool that the new costume
just throws out the window the new new
costume is passable they they throw out
half the grit though the yes yes they do
I don't like that yeah I like the grit
give me back that grit that whole first
season like fight scenes included was
all grit yeah and you know but you know
you can't you can't stay there forever
I sure you can't stay there don't stops
working you go out was working on four
stops working
yeah I think I think that my little
buddies little bit too plain let's have
some dark storylines whatever what dies
don't need that you don't need to
violently change tone because it's
getting old I'm okay with it I I would
prefer the old costume because I think
it looks way better I actually can't
give you didi spoilers chat because I've
only seen the first 10 minutes yeah of
season two I could spoil the first ten
minutes oh my god we're daredevil
doesn't punch anybody that might be true
I forget he hits a bunch of people off
camera there's a physical armed
robbery's running down the street I do
what what I'm really enjoying overall
Marvel Universe wise and this is no
spoilers I swear to you two snow
spoilers as everyone knows the Punisher
is in season two
and so like the big question looming
over season two and this was hinted at
in the previews is you know like what
makes one vigilante right and one
vigilante wrong you know the Punisher is
the bad guy cuz he kills but but
Daredevils going out then kicking
people's asses how where do we draw the
line and it's like setting up the
matically setting up Captain America
Civil War is really nice getting you in
that and that mindset I think it's neat
yeah it's neat what they can do as a
universe one just Punisher show up how
how soon I want to say first episode
okay but I don't ride own trial I'm 9 in
and I've been binging so it's like I
don't remember early he shows up early
this can't be a spoiler because I
haven't seen Elektra everyone knows
she's in it okay um you want to know
when she shows up
sure just something just tell me when
she shows up just kind of curiosity not
early not early right
like is the whole like thematically is
it all just the Punisher because like
kingpin was the running thing right is
there who's the big bad guy oh yeah I
spoil err alright that's fine that's
fine that we can't tell you but I love
that actor who plays The Punisher okay
yeah he had a small role in the first
couple seasons of Walking Dead a small
role he had a good were good role in the
first couple seasons of Walking Dead
he's a good Punisher I I enjoy him he
can only play a very serious menacing
dude and he fucking plays the shit out
of it alright so alright he can't be
anybody can't be better than Dolph
Lundgren hahahaha let's be honest no
one's as good as Dolph Lundgren at
anything he's no Dolph Lundgren's
notifier but if you had to just peck at
the Dolph Lundgren memorial it would be
him yeah I always a little chip little
chip the Dolph Lundgren memorial
I already MIT grad do you know that
Dolph Lundgren yes he's a he's a
linguist
wait is that Dolph Lundgren or Lauren's
only he's an engineer is the part of
Dolph Lundgren as a linguist is
hysterical I think that's Loretto
absolutely hysterical that might be I
might be thinking of Lorenzo Lamas Dolph
Lundgren is a chemical engineer Dolph
speaks like five languages is what
they're saying that's great jack is
always running no what if one of those
I'm one of those old 80s 90s action
stars is like a professor of something I
want to say it doesn't matter okay
what's so funny about Dolph Lundgren as
a linguist is that a joke it's talking
about masters of the universe recently
yeah
with Mike and Jake and a great movie
with don't wonderin I don't think he
knew how to speak English when he got
cast for that no seriously they wanted
to dub his lines the other reason I
didn't get dubbed over in masters
University cuz they like ran out of
money so they just kept his audio that's
great that's great he's the bad guy from
Rocky
yes for for Rocky for he's the Russian

okay get up and shoot him
now wait she's not dead even though
there's no blood and we'll we'll find
out sure you can do this draw gun
should I say freeze which I should shoot
the gun I mean he has a machine gun I
would shoot no questions asks what
marksman with marksmanship my bullet has
found its target the hijacker falls to
the floor and his dying breath he says
I'm taking you all with me he says in a
fading voice the timing device on the
bow you know what the timing device
andhe bomb has been activated I put my
gun back in my holster and survey the
onslaught people on the plane look
relieved except for the dead one no no
I'm everyone would be fuckin relieved
she's fine it's fine she's fine a HAP's
78 thank you for subscribing we really
appreciate it
the Stewart is still Bentley shaken up
things meet the very very makes me very
much for saving your life and then heads
into the gut bed okay we need to find a
bomb now oh I bought Boise Boise sunny
your holy cat hole I mean I mean crap
you're such a hero but uh you know I
hate to I hate to burst in on you like
this and there's just one more thing
rich one more thing sunny sunny one more
thing we better find that bomb you know
or else we're all gonna blow up but
that's what I'm guessing okay Milken I'm
milking my Keith I'll go I'll go I'll
check the cockpit area you search yeah
I'm just gonna leave frame again once
again I'm gonna leave frame that's what
I'm gonna do you're gonna be smoking to
get at you prime I'm probably gonna be
smoking ice what is what is the proper
police procedure should is the police
been obligated to yell freeze first I
just shot him he's just walking out the
door I'm just curious what what the
letter of law says about that did Sonny
bonds just commit manslaughter but I'm
saying I wouldn't find it justified but
would the law
we need to hear from an actual policeman
I think I think as long as they're
according to the policeman's hands
booked in or you know the the police
quest handbook right well I think that I
think this game is part written by an
actual former police officer so there
was one of the selling points okay
the use of firearms in course of duty
the discharge of a firearm at any person
will be done only in life-threatening
situations okay a police officer may use
a firearm only in self-defense when
assaulted with a deadly weapon a police
officer may use a firearm when in fear
of his life or the life of another okay
so he has a machine gun yes he's already
made a death threat it's probably take
that machine gun and and so I think
there was reasonable fear for the your
safety and the safety of those around
you all right yeah all right I did a
good thing I think you did a good thing
I know someone a friend a friend of the
family actually teaches at the police
academy yeah and next time I see him I
will ask yeah yeah like do you have to
yell freeze or if you just see a guy
with a mask and a machine gun like you
shot somebody else who was holding
somebody hostage yeah it was only
somebody hostage yeah then then his
partner in crime walks through the door
their guns up in the air yeah he wasn't
he wasn't walk he didn't walk out with a
gun pointed at you in fact that he kept
walking backwards he didn't yes in that
situation what's the deal do you try to
take him you know well you know what you
probably might have wanted to take him
alive to get more information out of him
right yep probably but of course now we
have time to think about it that was
adrenaline surging through our veins we
got to find that bomb oh you better save
I'm good
did you we're going to okay great
there's a cockpit door an exit door in
front and the door in the back leading
to a bathroom probably in the bathroom
they came from the back hmm I think we
can safely assume bathroom bombing
I oh right
like like like a poop is it is that what
you thought
that's like a poop that's just where
your brain automatically one poop jokes
all the time 100% all the time
the best hijack that wears a ski mask
why is this texture style a little bit
different then and obviously is
elsewhere in the game it's like up in
the corner the font looks smaller to me
listen me I think it's just the fancy
played a special the plane is special
right now yeah mass hijacker was a ski
mask a loose green jacket with many
buckets and blue jeans he has an Uzi
machine gun in his grip get Susie yeah
wait wait
don't open the kit I'm doing crime scene
investigation should you know I should
probably I should probably find that
bomb that's exactly what you should do
which high Jagga the mass of the
unmasked the mast okay
murder in the front bomber in the back
search missed pockets sure I find a pair
of wire Clippers in the jagged pocket of
the mast hai jacket bit a bit a bit no
yeah it's fine up there that is I was
waiting for that
that's right kick him for good measure
that's what I would do you dickhead I
find nothing in the jacket buckets of
the unmatched high jacket okay what else
does it say about me turbans a
9-millimeter I mean you should take both
of their guns in case they're not dead
wants me to be specific uh-huh
I checked the unmess hijackers packets
and find what appears to be some sort of
name on an ID card I look at the name
and the obviously phony ID card how the
hell did he get through them
airport security it's a joke it's the
80s I think joke I'm at a bad dude
really that's what you're going with
them man a bad dude that's what you're
going with it for his actual name
that's his phony ID no that's his phony
name is a there's a man who would
realize murder innocent civilians and
you're making it you're calling a man a
bad dude yep we're gonna we're gonna
pretend that this is all child's play is
that what we're doing game that's
exactly what we're doing that's exactly
what we're doing less than Kate thank
you for subscribing for 16 monta no I am
I am offended what I am I am I am Sonny
bonds and somehow I am offended I mean
how the fun is they pull that off it was
the 80s man they didn't care I'm the
most racist cop that's ever want to beep
and I've offended by our metal battery I
bet a bad dude it's a they seem to be
making light of the situation that's
true
ah this game is designed for children
hence the murder prostitution and boring
political dialogue looking through the
pants of the best hijacker I find
nothing literally he has no dick making
fun of making fun of the hijacker not
the situation I think that's appropriate
okay you need to find a bomb now yeah
time pauses I think when text is on the
screen I think we're okay okay doot doot
doot doot doot doot looking around
looking around it looks like I'm looking
around actually I just can't walk
diagonally actually oh I can't I just I
haven't been using the number pad okay
looking around the room I see a sink
toilet trashcan and a paper towel
dispenser trash can yeah yeah the trash
can I see left trash move trash
Oh we learned that lesson right from the
other trash can get Trish get trash you
search trash okay
well so we have an earlier paper towel
dispenser look at paper towel dispenser
all right now we have a thing open
looking rather Oh open dispenser open it
oh my god it's a bomb it appears to be
made by Acme bomb is full why is it a
timing device so shit oh god we have a
minute we have to just choose a wire
because our manual there's gotta be a
solution a bomb disposal manual bomb
disposal manual what's in the manual
oh here for use of getting rid of
firearms on an airplane shooting range
computer blue white yellow and purple
wire attached to the bomb look add
purple wire purple wires connected look
look at timer right blue wire is
connected oh look at the timer they're
all connected that doesn't help
uh-huh blue what the white okay okay
okay cut all the just cut all the wires
I've I've played keep talking and nobody
explodes with this man uh-huh
I know better than to listen to him
never listen to me you're gonna try to
use your brain and I think that's that's
problem number one that wasn't using
your brain no no I was gonna try and do
I could try to shove it down the toilet
I was actually gonna trying to shove the
bomb down the toilet because I couldn't
find a clue
sure I'm what wire to cut first I
thought maybe that's a red herring oh
the wire sniffers were I thought maybe
the wire snippers were a red herring
that's that's interesting
interesting
I want to shoot at the red guys right
this time it's lupus I saw a lot of
comments speaking of the the super hot
discussion yeah a lot of people were
complaining about how much time we spent
on the story what else to talk about
exactly also like the story is complete
bullshit and you have to play through
the story mode in order to play the
endless mode
it's a required it's so much bitching
going on in the comments that videos let
people bitch just is there seemed like
it yeah seem like there's a lot of
bitching on our videos so much potential
of what you do but you didn't I don't
know what we didn't do it he doesn't
like me mad about something it seems
like you guys just have like a
conversation about games it's not like
objective at all wait they're saying
search the other guy's pants did you get
the wires nippers yeah I shouldn't read
that because they're reading
walkthroughs yep you shouldn't I
shouldn't you're right oh oh his ID did
you get his ID oh I don't know if you
need it
thought I did
oh they're telling if they're trying to
give us hints on how to get get extra
points do you want to get extra points
sure they're saying you can unmask the
guy and take a picture
now or maybe not
you guys should order your playlist from
newest to oldest first on your channel
page I do agree with that for what the
first video like let the main video just
like Sims cuz a random video when you go
to them well when you go to are you when
do you go to our YouTube page our first
video I think is like Sonic it seems
we're just some kind of random one when
I do it it's different for like some
people who are sub that unsub right
for what oh wait for one for the YouTube
channel no no it should be the same big
video like a it's Sonic or order a
teenager I thought undertale was
probably one of the random undertale was
real it was up there for me last time I
went I'll double check that well and I
have our our previously recorded live
playlist going from oldest to newest so
you could so because a lot of people
just like to watch them one right after
the other and then you can watch them in
order that should probably be the other
way around though for that you mother
review on the newest games first I think
you think yeah oh no for I'm saying for
the twitch stream cut-ups
for the twitch stream cut-ups oldest to
newest that's how I have it probably
right there
I don't but I agree for previously
recorded that should be newest oldest
because then you get the most modern
game I'll look into it
my good man I don't think I could take
off the ski mask I think you're wrong
okay okay great let's go let's save and
undo a bomb oh I did search and then
removed it you you stupid game
what I think that's the music the
confusion my kid was check that another
plane and I don't have it so that all
that nonsense won't be grabbing the kid
I think they just wanted you to get that
today they probably just wanted me to
get this message hi there's one more
thing they want you to do what they want
you to search the turbine okay I can't
help but I'm reading the chat now chat
try not to spoil it for us we want to
figure stuff out ourselves but to be
fair we already went through this okay
there's the unmasked hijack is turbine
and find a piece of paper entitled
building your own bomb and I just feel
so it feels so unrewarding I was up my
list of things to do was that or would
you have had might have forgotten to do
it in our gibbering exactly that all
right no more spoilers chat I think we
should stop reading did I get I'm a bad
guy oh wait what are you saying what I
say it said it would not be a good idea
to exit the plane at 25,000 feet I'm not
trying to walk over there you were
okay I may add a bad dude you keep
trying to exit the point no the game
thinks I'm trying to I'm not trying to
too much new key you can give
suggestions as long as you are not look
going through through but here's the
problem we don't know who's looking
through the wreath or not so I'm going
to be a little more careful about
reading the chant okay oh wait do you
have your bum did you look at the bomb
thing oh I'll read it now I'm gonna read
it when I was there but fine
read bomb thing what's it called listen
what's the name they want wrong
instructions okay Qaddafi they're not
that clever connect yellow wire for
timer connect white for battery backup
and disconnect yellow wire connector
wire and blue wire for main battery set
timer connect yellow wire bomb is now
armed do not move or touch wires morning
only connect same color wires connecting
wires and have the other one results in
immediate detonations you don't have to
do this in Reverse so if we snip the
snip the yellow wire like should we do
this in Reverse this is how you make the
bomb snip the yellow wire snip the blue
and the purple then since the white I
might be 9,000 percent wrong sure I'm
gonna try say yep save or out of or
officially out of places to put saves
okay so yellow blue purple white is the
order you want to do it in by the way
all right so cut trashcan man I'm
looking into it I was right about being
a backwards by the way oh yeah yeah nice
oh wait you're blue purple is what's
next
Connect purple wire and blue wire yeah
say blue and purple yeah I mean if
you're if you're gonna just yeah fall
backwards you have ten seconds left
I'll write that down route and deliver
now wait
white to connect yellow huhu connect
yellow did you already snip yellow yeah
there's only one wire left connect that
I'm doing only all of these backwards oh
I get it
I didn't get it before cut white and
then cut yellow jack oh god I'm a
fucking cliche bitch cliche one second
left
that's great rich yeah that's great
if this remain like in the modern era
I've got an achievement for that shit
by the way that's really true a
meaningless achievement that is really
true
mini metro
oh why don't you just work through need
overhead oh no I announced everyone that
I have successfully disarmed the bomb

it moves their wrists right down yes
Keith looks around oh this is this is
Keith now yeah not bad not Jarvis Jarvis

been listening to an audio book lately
and it's by a British man and he
narrates his own audio book and I just
love the accent Dirk gently's holistic
detective agents yeah the the audio book
is read by the author
by Douglas Adams and it is quite a
lovely audio book mostly because he
talks like this and it's very soothing
ah yes huh I know you know they're doing
the the TV show soon they're turning it
into a decently Dirk Gently huh that and
a max landis is helping right through
that and or produce it or something he's
involved somehow and so I was like oh I
should read this book and I couldn't
read it because it's written so verbose
that it breaks my head like I tried I
tried reading a couple chapters and I
had to reread the couple chapters and it
was just too much for me but the
audiobook is love you ever read any of
the Hitchhiker's no no no started as a

horrible thing I've ever said Richard
Edlund Evans that was shameful it was
that was I'm not ashamed of much I'm
ashamed on you sure yeah yeah that's Wow
you know why I'm in too much of a Sonny
buns mu I've been doing this voice and
the character is taken over big
possessed by Sonny ponds oh I I agree
with it yet it's got to have something
to do with that dog by the way covers
probably a clue there's a manhole cover

know right he does this a lot this is
all I know about Bernie Sanders he does

a lot and we talk about the banks and we
talk about the 1% we talk about the 1%
of the 1% and we're gonna take this
country back that's good I like that

that was a it was a tasteless joke and
it was completely and it wasn't funny
enough to justify you know like that was
tasteless just for being tasteless but
hey you got it we have to move on we're
in the storm I know how we're working on
Bernie Sanders deal it's like it's like
New York you gotta get you got to get a
little New York and then you gotta get a
little older and a little jewy ER and
then and then you can you just talk
about the banks and then you got to get
the arm movements in and cuz he's kind
of squints when he talks and that's what
we do and that's what we're gonna do
we're gonna did you see what happened in
Arizona voter fraud the Clintons of the
world you're good at impressions I do I
try I never I was never any good at it I
can't do it yeah I'm terrible I I admire

stilton's underground sewer got
