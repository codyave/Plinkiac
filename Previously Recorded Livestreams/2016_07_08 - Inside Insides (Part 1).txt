what's-what's no Jer
lots of lots of things are new rich we
can there's lots of stuff to talk about
today while we play first first things
first what are we playing and what the
fuck is this we are playing inside
inside is a game that looks and
apparently plays a lot like limbo the
the indie darling from a few years ago
made by the people who made limbo the
indie darling of a few years ago
limbo was the one where you played as
like a little shadow boy and you you had
to like platform your way through a
shadow everything was silhouettes and it
was deep and dark and mysterious and we
play as a little boy here and a lot of
silhouettes and I said you know what
someone asked if we were gonna play this
and I said yeah why the fuck Madison
yeah look at him jump looks nice
because I was not here on Wednesday we
wanted to do a makeup stream to also
make up for the make up room we didn't
do from last week so I said fuck out
playing inside play this thing like a
like a dumb little kid little kid I
could not be here on Wednesday I went to
a super swanky movie premiere that I was
really excited to go to my I've talked
about him many times
my cousin Jake Jake Szymanski yeah the
guy I used to do stand-up comedy with I
did improv comedy with him I made videos
with him he's the mustache guy in if you
look back at my old high five videos
he's the guy with the mustache okay
we worked at Funny or Die together he
also we are the almost twins Jake and I
were born a week apart we spent every
waking hour together
I can only assume different mother so
that would have been some pregnancy Wow
right oh yeah I see it I want a truck
I'm being sneaky now we know is there a
story to anything or not yet just
started we're in the woods where it
started we're in the woods I assume
we're sneaking away why is the title so
low gungeon I changed total check got
refresh refresh so in any case he Jake
worked for Funny or Die for a while then
he spent a little time directing digital
shorts for Saturday Night Live Alou look
at these guys in their creepy masks
sneak sneak and he made if anyone saw
the HBO mockumentary seven days in hell
with Andy Sandberg and Jon Snow he
directed that he's directed some TV show

refrigerator is this should we this is
gonna have like a very special message
we did that you just can't get out we
can can't open the refrigerator I can't
I can't do anything with your address
damn it I'm sure there's something I uh
maybe I can climb on top of it the part
of me that loves dark humor which is
which is like all of me that's like 100%
of me mm-hmm
really want you to be able to get
trapped in a refrigerator oh hey this is
my first puzzle rich I need to figure
this out so in any case oh oh oh oh I
can grab it
nice what's that noise sounds like a
giant refrigerator
nope there's nothing and that should be
pretty loud did hear that that dog
probably would have been sniffing over
here we jump Zona case he directed a
movie called mike and dave need wedding
dates which is out this weekend and he
convinced fox to have a Milwaukee
premiere for aw for us friends and
family and that's where I was Wednesday
night
to support my cousin and my bro I get
seeing a movie that I find to be
incredibly funny nope do you see it huh
you see it I see what you said I see it
and then you jumped in nothing alright
I'm gonna try and change this again I
swear to God I hit update yeah I hit the
update thing I did sometimes it takes a
while I hit it again by changing in
fulfilled invalid title Oh possibly bad
language
we can't swear apparently we can't swear
all right well it didn't damage didn't
change cuz apparently we can't swear
I've never well I guess we've never
swore in the title before
doing crater hitch this game is too
that's gotta be something reason I'm
almost positive we have chuan before
oh there's a dog there's a dog swimming
after there's a dog swimming ask me he's
a dog so we have Jesus this game is
showing a pretty dagger hold on let me
let me see if I can change the something
on the Game Capture really quick give me
one moment here I think I can up the
Alpha
can I
to be able to do that oh I thought I was
able to um whoopsie
to like up to the l-let me out let me
change that inside the settings here for
the last couple streams been asking us
to talk about the CS csgo connor strike
go gambling scandal rich have you ever
played chemistry I've never played
counter-strike
I have never played counter know what I
could tell you about the the the
gambling Fiasco what can you tell me
this guy who plays counter-strike
professionally also owned a gambling
thing yep I know I know we know as much
as you guys do which is a guy apparently
what he was doing was doing
advertisements for the gambling website
but he wasn't telling anyone their
advertisement so he'd go on and do and
be like oh my god I can't believe I want
all these skins on this gambling website
and he never told anyone that he owned
him which is a dick move but I I know
nothing did he like gamble update like
bet against himself for anything weird
how does this work
no no so who gives a shit I don't he's
just a sleazy asshole ya know the world
is full of sleazy as the only thing he
probably did wrong was he told me like
he showed people how easy it was to win
on this one website and he owned the
website and he easily could have
manipulated him Wang so now he's just a
dick just a dick who cares I don't know
anything about csgo I know those skins
for the guns are as ridiculously
expensive as some hats in tf2 you know
that's yeah do you want that because
because it's rare oh oh wow oh my god
Richie shot me to death there is no
running which is really bothering I
approve of children being shot down sure
Oh trust me Jack's gotta talk about some
pokey mob Oh fuckin no I wanted to I
just wanted to talk about Mike and Dave
for a little bit just because it was
what I was doing on Wednesday
obviously this little boy just got shot
which was awesome playing a game or a
movie on the fence so I know so far I've
had to do things I've had to UM I've had
to like pull stuff over sanika platforms
so there has been some fail states this
tutorial is section that's fine
oh Jesus they're those masks
honestly creeped me out and I'll be
honest with you okay okay okay so I need
to figure out what to do over here
here's the puzzle this guy's chasing me
we jump over that well I'm into this so
far
nope nope fuck fuck didn't jump over
that one didn't jump over that one Oh
oh my god that's creepy what is this
game about this is it you're watching it
it's about a boy little boy running away
from men and masks I guess it could be a
nads boy okay I guess it could be a
little girl that's a boy
a little thing you're a little thing now
a snap your way for this guy there you
go again and we have to jump that's
important
it's either a boy or a non-agenda
reverse is something I don't fucking
know
probably Oh or do I want a surface yet
oh yes I did that I wanted the surface I
definitely wanted the surface so far I
love the perfect way and I've I prove
this
umberto Cabbage Patch I'm bad dog
Cabbage Patch he's gonna comment but I
know you're going to address that later
okay so just redefine it this is all
right Jack what are your thoughts on
pokemons go oh my god it's the Great
Escape do you want to you want to like
experience more of this before you get
into it cuz I know you're probably gonna
get deep into it I'm good we're gonna
talk about Pokemon go for the rest of my
life probably um no we can start talking
about but is there anything else that
you want to talk about right no I just
get a feel for this home first
I don't know that pigs I got a dead pigs
that's a fucked up man it's so fucked up
so Pokemon go does a gamer a creepypasta
I know I remember limbo being very
similar but like this has an added creep
factor of the adults hunting you
you know limbo had like monsters and and
big creepy shadow this is this is the
children of the corn shit right here
whoa
that was neat yeah this is this is
definitely I feel like this is darker
because of the of the grown-ups hunting
you
but uh so here's the shtick with Pokemon
go is it is a real-world augmented
reality game doctor tell us I'll bring
out later I'm gonna let Jack go on about
pokemon gold crap probably for about the
next hour and then I will bring this up
so in Pokemon go you are a pokemon
trainer an you have to catch pokemon but
it uses google map information and so
you have to walk around the real world
in order to catch pokemon you need to
take a walk around the block and then
maybe you can get a Rattata
or whatever and then you have to take a
walk around the block again and find
these things called pokey stops and
pokey stops are always that like like
landmark ish sites you know like um they
always know they always they exactly
and so then you you get you have to walk
close to it and you have to be within
like 10 15 feet of it and then a little
thing will show up on your app and then
you can swipe it and then you get like
pokeballs and revives and stuff for your
pokemons and eggs and stuff to hatch
right but you have to walk you have to
get out and move and it turns walking
around the block into a goddamn
adventure and it's great now when you
first brought this up you show that
today I know they're working on like a
new a regular Pokemon game and I thought
that's where this was from what they
were making you do like this kind of
shit in what would have better normal
Pokemon game and that would have been
obnoxious hmm but it's it's own thing
oh yeah it's complete that I'm fine with
it it's completely something you don't
um I just wanted to play a regular
Pokemon game and I don't I would find it
extremely annoying that I have to go and
drive down a few blocks to catch my
Ratatat attack
right Oh we're gonna have to walk these
chickens into that thing is that we need
to sacrifice the chickens I think I do
that oh yeah it sucks them up okay oh I
need some chicken feed I need some
chicken feed so I can lure the little
chickens Oh or no I just need to make
them come over here they just need it oh
my god I need to sacrifice these
chickens rich and run I'm gonna beat you
I'm gonna beat you chickens you're
fucking dead that's what I used to start
it oh they're not dumbest thing I wanted
to murder them come on
Oh for you before that game so so this
game is all about walking around and the
more Pokemon you catch the more you can
level them up and then the more you have
to walk around and it has this like this
kind of like hidden system of of
catching pokémon and so like everyone
thought you can tap on your screen you
can see what Pokemon are near you right
and the one you want
might not be near you and so you have to
kind of like them if you walk a little
bit this way and then it oh it's a
little bit closer
oh now a little bit okay oh it's it's
definitely over here you have to find it
in the world which is why people are
worried about like children running into
the street and shit yes which I guess
you could be what are we gonna find the
first reported death due to Pokemon go
what is what is the first child going to
wander into the middle of a highway if
it hasn't happened already soon very I
can only imagine very soon I'm just
gonna jump and see what happens cuz that
was when you've told me about this that
was my first thought mm-hmm kid dies
wandering into highway looking for
Pokemon his face in the screen there are
I beat in front of me look there we glue
things on that pile of pig
ya know see that now there wiggle you
like worm you think yes I'm those piles
of pigs that's weird
don't you think yeah oh I probably need
that car to pigs so ya know so far so
far it has been incredible
I have just wanted to go outside and
catch more Pokemon I have I've only had
it for a day and a half and I've already
walked 10 kilometers I don't even know
how long a kilometer is I was telling
rich like I left an hour and a half
before I knew I needed to be here just
so I could put my cell phone on my bike
handles and ride my bike very slowly
here so I could catch pokemon on the way
here and then I caught like 25 of them
on the way here rich I hatched a couple
eggs I'm gonna do the same shit on my
way back home and it's gonna be great
how many are there to catch I it's only
the original and so there's like
probably a hundred and what's the every
175 oh yeah I'm exactly familiar with
CRT Wow your bike ride thing you're
already cuz I mostly done with the game
now oh god no there's never there's
never any done
there's never done rich yeah you got
like a quarter of your Pokemon you're by
but it's not about just getting a
quarter program on it's also about
leveling them come on oh this is creepy
it's about leveling them up rich and
then and then there's Jim battles which
I haven't even gotten into yet because
they're they're very difficult and and
then like holding on to Jim's and oh
it's it's so crazy I went out last night
like Lisa got home a little late so she
got home at like 10:00 10:30 and I was
like honey I'm gonna go out for a little
bit that pigs ass there is a worm
sticking out of that pigs ass and they
gotta put the warm in a less distracting
place this is first you can't kill
chickens this is supposed to be a
serious game but scatological oh oh
because it's still alive because it's
still alive
I think you're gonna do yep
already on it rich you got nothing on me
pig you got nothing on me this shouldn't
work
what really fall down that could be a
creepy person now 200 yes do I have to
drag this stupid pig now it's like an
alien worm invasion could be oh can I
really know this can't have a good end
this can't be little Johnny saves the
world the tone is all wrong for it right
I'm sure there's something to do with
this button okay so here's what people
are telling me about Pokemon go yeah
apparently it was a girl playing Pokemon
go recently we found a dead body
well yes I saw that that was a that was
that was just in the news yeah because
you know why because it forces you to
like explore the world around you and I
just pulled that were mines of course I
just pulled that worm out of the pig's
ass Ridge that was the puzzle for this
particular at least now I know why
Oh what the fuck Oh I am now controlling
them with my mind
well that is creepy as shit and that's
great how does the kid better do this
uh-huh because he's played video games
before I I need to know what's going on
and I'm sure that's not part of the game
what the hell is going on mixie and 1:20
says hey Jack and rich I love the show I
don't know what do you like nirvana
if so I highly recommend the first four
albums of the Silver Chair good old
school punk rock
you don't like Narada oh well fuck my
cock I've heard silver higher I love me
some nirvana yeah yeah yeah here's
your's here's you here's how you sum up
birch Evans musical
a CBC the doors at Nirvana hmm that's it
I'm gonna make these guys go back in
their cage
what can you close it no all right
can you jump maybe I can
okay you guys just stay over there how
about that that's that's weird
that's weird I remember the first
silverchair album I remember I do like
paper wood but mostly I think I just
like Dark Side of the Moon
sure sure sure rich ac/dc is shit to be
honest ac/dc it's like a handful of
extraordinarily good songs fuck yeah
like the greatest shit in the world and
then they have just a sea of fucking
songs that sound bland in the same yes
but their songs that are good songs
they're extraordinary they're they're
great grain tea thunderstruck hells
bells that their whole first album like
was like it had hints of comedy like big
balls where it's like where's that
coming from
that was great dirty deeds done dirt
cheap oh fuck yeah
back in black back in fucking black back
in black is beautiful money talks
well I got a lot of forgettable shit
mixed in with those but what blood
mm-hmm no a CDs is great
so this game is just limbo again I've
never actually played limbo I've only
played like the first hour or so of
limbo but I've heard this is very much
like limbo but I also hear that it's
better okay so for whatever that means
to anyone but you know it's puzzles and
it's got a neat world and so far I'm
okay with it
can i grab this chair no okay jump on
this chair what about the Zeppelin rich
now you discipline Finn really for all
your classic rock love what does start
naming some Zeppelin songs let's see if
cashmere is that a whole lot of love a
thing exactly I'm okay with Zeppelin
stairway to heaven just like the most
overrated thing ever yeah agreed I think
even Led Zeppelin agrees with that
though
well it was a lot of other songs I like
I don't just like songs from ac/dc
Nirvana and the doors I think though
with with Nirvana and especially the
doors I like pretty much every song
they've done there's some stuff on like
bleach that just sounds like screeching
to me but in general
I am missing an element to this puzzle
hmm
you like some Biggie Smalls rich I'm not
saying everyone should hate rap I'm just
saying I don't like rap that's true
about resentence he does not like rap
it's usually just talking over samples
of music that's actually good I mean
that is but basically the creative stuff
in a rap song it's been stolen from some
other source that is so incorrect that's
fine it's you can read it no well the
bothersome thing about that statement is
while some rappers do use samples I know
they don't probably all don't and like
it's not like that that used to be
well-liked widely done in rap but that
is not that hasn't been widely done
around in the past like 20 years right
well there are birds
okay this I'm sure that box has
something to do with it what I'm
assuming is eventually I need to push
that box
down to break these boards so much Nicki
says right now it's not too much Nicki
who was on scrolling scrolling too fast
me fun you veces yeah if it was just
talking over video game footage it would
be great rich look I don't call this
music I'm sure there's nothing over
there
oh I figured it out I figured it out I
know today it's like there we go I'm
just a big dummy
there we go wasn't the dead gangster
paradise
Coolio Liam Coolio Coolio getting upset
at we're down for Amish paradise when
gangster's paradise was essentially
stolen from Stevie Wonder retro right
right but one is a remix and one is a
parody yeah yeah no stolen stolen I'm
sure that was all done legally but oh
god did that kill me that killed me
based on your limp body I would say yes
bitch please don't say Coolio why not
call themself Colio that's that's his
name rich has the right to use the man's
name Coolio it would not be someone who
I would refer to when talking about the
rap genre that would be like they'd be
like talking about rock music and
talking about Nickelback all right do
you know who Nickelback is yeah they
suck look I think all rap sucks well why
would I differentiate Coolio
because cool because he's bad
coolly it was not the ambassador from I
never said he was enough reflexive rich
everything is wrong with you I can't
express an opinion without people losing
their minds
hmm
there was another one of those head
things Oh
that's different
okay so we have to have them stand on
the two things obviously one's gonna hit
a wall and you keep moving them for bid
right
I think I need to close the door on one
now firmly I'm on the outside so you can
see where he's blocking see now I'm
thinking what I'm thinking here is then
I take this guy who and I move him to
this wall so now the other ones walking
further this way in order to oh oh sure
there was a hole there was a whole other
side to this to that I just didn't do
because I wanted to explore what was
this way let's see if this works
no network probably getting the wrong
guy with the door try to close it now
and walk on the outside sure sure I'm
with him
we're anti back seating as far as like
give us a little bit to solve the puzzle
we will let you know yeah when we need
help solve the puzzle don't worry we're
soft but I would have gotten there I
would have gotten there Hollen there was
a whole thing over here this whole thing
wonder oh that's it left behind I got an
achievement for doing that okay great
great great great cause poor thinks
we're fast on the puzzles you know we're
very early on I'm sure we're gonna get
stumped I'm sure we're gonna get stumped
sooner or later by the brain power of
myself and rich Evans mostly rich Evans
we will get through this game this kid
can only moved it was like right or left
you'd never be able to find his way
around some of these obstacles
right yeah rich comeback seed because
he's here and like I said if we need if
we need help we will we will shout it
out you know who sucks speaking have
shouted out kiss yeah kiss they just
suck so much as musicians as musicians
and as their image so everything about
kisses obnoxious shot you didn't die I
did it I tell you I jumped yeah no you
did I knew to jump you did it I knew to
jump you're gonna fall over aren't you
this for an ID game you wouldn't eat
naughty dog game you wouldn't even have
to press any buttons during that or else
or else the big button prompts would
have came up press a now press a now oh
oh no oh no oh no oh that was part of
the game part of the puzzle
that's fine but basically I know if we
stop talking about it a little bit ago
Pokemon go I think I've seen a couple
people like call it like the best VR
experience and I agree you know like we
talked about our problems with VR know a
lot and a lot is like you know feedback
and you know like not having the the
haptics of the world with us but here
you have the world rich waiting for the
first kid to die oh I'm sure I'm sure
it's gonna happen I'm sure it's gonna
happen but it's so much fucking fun and
it's free it's a free game everyone can
play it eat well you can play it if the
server's are up and the server's are
always down because they're a little
crap at the moment but I'm having such a
good time playing Pokemon go the only
problem is a lot of times you know
summer vacations that my kids aren't in
school right now and so they'll want to
come on a walk with me then I gotta let
them play too and it's a cluster fuck I
want to play
no the kiss movie we watched last
Halloween is not the reason I'm not a
kiss man that didn't help I've always
thought they were kind of obnoxious yeah
they suck never really liked the music
and their whole stick always just seemed
kind of dumb yeah I guess I'm uh uh yeah
it's a stick I'll allow it but you know
there it would be allowable if their
music was all right someone was already
mugged in the stab I said they went into
they went into a bad neighborhood to
look for Pokemon and someone stole
hopeful that she's Darwinism at work
actually well no no no you know what no
one should steal a phone I know
Mongo what's what's what's in all the
gene pool when I let's get rid of some
of those nonsense when I did like today
I ran into a bunch of people who are
also looking for Pokemon and you know
like everyone has their phone out and
everyone has their phone out in the
exact same way where it's kind of like
hip level and they're looking down and
you see them walking around looking down
the phone walking on and like you just
know who's playing Pokemon you can't
make eye contact me like hey you see
that squirtle over there and I go oh is
that where the squirtle is and you have
a little conversation about where the
Pokemon are and you know I know you can
both get it I want to see racing down
the street to get to that new that just
appears maybe that's gonna happen they
say they're gonna do like they're gonna
do like local events where you have to
get together as a group and as a group
like use all your Pokemon to defeat
someone then we'll see some car accident
assess this game I take it all back this
game could turn into a glorious
spectacle can you can you tilt the
ladder can you yeah I was kidding get up
there they go
now I've run into so many people like
even last night it was super late at
night and I'm walking through the park
you know looking for Pokemon I was
trying to do a gym towns but the server
was acting a little funny and like I
said like a group of guys and then I had
their phone on and we gave each other a
little look like yeah so you don't put
you doing some Pokemon
oh that's horrible rich maybe okay so
maybe I shouldn't have turned that on
first is that ways what I'm getting from
it I probably need to turn it on for
something hopefully just to get the
power on for the elevator yeah I
definitely should have opened the door
first and now we know now we know
sometimes we learn through death it's
not it's not a popular game did somebody
gets murdered for the Pokemon they've
collected so there's no P versus P
there's no player versus player battle
against and I think that's very
purposeful there should be I mean this
could be so epic this could be so epic
the chaos this game could wreak on
society I do really think that would be
fun is much like in the Pokemon game you
can come across another trainer and you
can't reject a challenge if you can
challenge done that straight right if
you turn them down you just lose all
your Pokemon so you have to stop
whatever you're doing to get into a
Pokemon battle with anybody who you
don't lose your Pokemon you you just
lose like the in-game currency would you
start us and so you then you have to
think to yourself oh you should lose the
Pokemon well that's not true to the game
well to make the gameplay work for this
new publisher easier that's really how
it should work if you want to make it
more exciting that I well I guess what
I'm saying is I like the idea of like
risking an in-game thing for your time
in the real world we're like I'm really
late to work but fuck I can take this
guy I got to protect my Pikachu I can
take this right to get my I can't lose
my Pikachu I named him right
Pikachu scan me through a lot of rough
panels oh yeah yeah no oh oh what's he
putting up oh he's putting up a he's
putting up a clay stir oh I want a coy
stir he's a nice type fuck yeah fuck
yeah okay all right hold on hold on for
a second people boo boo boo hey boss
boss I'm gonna be like five minutes late
five minutes
protip it's always wise to get your
enemies distracted with each other and
in fighting that's always to your
advantage yeah yeah
Nana says that is good pasty how about a
glass of milk I don't know what that is
got a reference to someone
you watch what they do ahead of time so
you know what's going on yeah kind of
but what did you jump I jumped and I was
outside of the square oh I knew it but
you know what I was just so into the
jump rhythm
bump-bump bump-bump second week quitting
smoking can you insult them for some ex
can you insult me for some extra
motivation no go fuck yourself
smokey mix smokes a lot is that good so
that they wanted I think I'm not really
sure I tried its ride I figure I don't
hate you enough to give you a good
honest insults
so I wonder what the reason is for these
meaningless tasks I can only assume this
is to prove they're under mind control
yeah did you almost do it I did thank
these people over there
just gonna play it safe until I see a
clear exit point don't freak out Jack
don't freak out mmm pretty I might want
to run yep okay okay
definitely price should have ran there
how are you supposed to go how was I
supposed to know well my character did
like look around nervously Oh could be a
fake out to blow your cover but then
you're definitely fucked run that's the
second time we've done a second or third
time we've done like a dog kind of faked
out where you know well what do you want
what do you want that's fine
oh oh here you know still coming still
coming I'm still coming what's the story
of the showed up late you know about as
much as we do really we're we're this
we're this little kid and people seem to
be under mind control of some sort and
there's other creepy guys with masks
they'd shoot you when they find you okay
that's definitely not the right call I
cannot outrun the dog to get to the mind
control thing that's the quote oh yeah
what I probably have to do is wait for
the dog to come out down here yeah there
we go then I climb up here because then
the dog has to double back there we go
I know you got a deal I was hoping you
would have to push that the other way
you weren't attached to it to land down
the dog that would have made me happy
but I'm a sick individual it's just a
remake of another world blade are the
world honestly know another world is
more is is almost like an adventure game
yeah not not a point-and-click but like
another world had it or you know what
it's it's like it's like it's it looks
like this you know it's a 2d
side-scroller but it's a lot like night
trap where you have to memorize and do
very specific things at very specific
times okay okay I get it ference ad says
hey rich I just watched all of the
cutscenes from the Ghostbusters game the
concepts of the spider which and the
Liberians backstory were far more
interesting than Ghostbusters - or even
the remake I can't say about the remake
cuz I haven't seen the remake it's
almost certainly gonna suck but I
haven't seen it there's there's a chance
extremely slim chance but the movie
won't suck I I got I got somebody in
general I agree
better than ghostbusters - the word on
the street about the Ghostbusters movies
is there were some reshoots whatever and
and it really sucked before the reshoots
and now now it's kind of all right is
what people are saying it's kind of I so
it's gone from really sucks to kind of
alright that's what you get okay I know
I just want to see what happens
hmm like cuz I can still control this
guy can you do anything here
no okay that's just wanna see if there's
anything for him to do
can you walk him without grabbing the
thing yeah okay but like this doesn't
open
what can you grab that's what I was
trying you can't do that you cannot oh
yeah there's nothing I can really do
over here too because I can't go back
and use that stairwell that clearly that
that stairwell would be great to use
right now yep
by the way that'd be a really useful
maybe maybe the kid has a mental problem
where he can't go laughter right it
probably has something to do with this
falling backwards maybe maybe that maybe
that maybe he was partially brainwashed
sure it probably has something to do
with this area right cuz like this area
seems different than all the other areas
this is a switch up there oh there's
another mind control thing up there can
you can him climb on the thing oh my god
what just solve the puzzle it's just no
but I'm still stuck where I was oh oh
wait but now there's two of them so
maybe the two of them can open the door
yeah maybe can you open the door now
can you grab it
huh see now what happened hold on I want
to I just want to double-check something
I want to see what happens if I get off
of the can you have him there we go okay
there we go
so now if I hop up I should control both
of them nope only one of them
interesting interesting
ah it's the word
oh no but it didn't on there
sweet jeebus yeah all right okay
well I figured it out that's what that
thing was for then all right then you go
up here now you control this guy who can
then take this thing then he jumps up on
the thing yeah
boom tomorrow eh Kate we are not fucked
we've figured it out
no wait no I just need to get him on top
of ledge so then this guy can fall and
get back on to just control this guy so
this guy can move the car let's go
hey we figured it out Bella no spoilers
don't spoil the the the puzzles for us
unless we ask you for help please Bella
Bella was trying to be helpful but might
not have known that we don't want no
spoilers
although I want to get right over this
thing this guy out
I think it's water guess what I don't
great work crackerjack work maybe
towards the back end of the opening yeah
yeah that's right and then just do it
faster and I just do it faster there we
go
what are those things that you control
uh they seem like brainwashed human
beings yeah they seem like brainwashed
human beings horribly creepy things are
going on game synopsis hey did you like
limbo yep
yeah pretty I really think that's it
well story-wise what was going on in
limbo was just monsters and it kid lost
in the forest pretty sure I'm pretty
sure that's it
oh wait wait when did this come out ah
that's a good question
Oh speedy games done quick is doing
Mario maker stuff and I'm missing it
shh shh that'd be great
that would be great actually I've been
looking for this is one thing yeah I've
been looking forward to
oh really and GDQ yeah I wanted to watch
the merrymakers don't know I can't I'm
sorry
shit happens you know and I guess we
wouldn't feel we wouldn't we wouldn't
judge our audience if they went over and
watch that right now two windows goddamn
it you can look the the SDS gdq chat is
just worthless is it yes it's a hundred
thousand people sings nonsense memes it
makes you weep for Humanity oh well yeah
Oh a button we should probably push the
button don't you think I know all the
stuff is on YouTube and I can watch it
later and yeah I can't watch it no okay
dad
damn it
they did a crypt of the necrodancer race
last night oh yeah over so fast you
could enjoy that door open freaking go
in that's our clothes before I could go
in obviously I meant that the other way
is there a switch I could switch it to
turn it off and get up the thing but I
just want to explore a little bit maybe
there's something over here probably get
off at first dingus this just gets me
back into the room I was in so I can try
again
what stream is rich talking about summer
games done quick it's the big
speedrunning marathon that's going on
Twitch this week they they they're
collecting money for charity I believe
which is a good thing that's a good
thing Jerry's good thing you heard it
here first folks charities a good thing
hmm there's a door and there's a chain
I'll let see if I can dive down and hit
that button and then swim over hope no
come on way to drown I'm gonna drive I'm
gonna drive I'm gonna drive yes well
that got me over here do I want to be
you over here that's the question
yeah great a floaty thing this will help
Oh
yesterday I hated charity thank you for
showing me the life breaking news
daddy's good daddy can be a good thing
almost had benefits a dick then it's not
really um I guess I guess you know even
dickheads need charity sometimes you
give money to Trump or Hillary your
person that's not charity that's
donating to a campaign okay
charity charity is donation donation
donation but it's not a charity right
charity implies you are giving to
someone less fortunate this is a charity
does it have to be something that's
universally considered to be good just
you're giving to your giving to someone
less fortunate I think is the only
stipulation to charity right like
technically like you know making sure
cats survive harsh winters is a charity
I think that's a silly charity because
like people need to who there's train
because like people needs to survive
harsh winters to you know I think that's
more important we're not category we're
not caring which is more important as
far as charity is concerned it's just
charity science ad says what I don't
like is that most of the hate towards
the Ghostbusters trailer was just that
it wasn't funny
yet the studio keeps saying the hey is
all sexist well what do you think
they're gonna do in us it's the easy way
to deflect and invalidate all criticism
right yeah no they've absolutely lucked
out with this whole with this whole
sexist thing look well they've lucked
out that people are buying into it it's
all fuckin deliberate like we want to
make money on ghostbusters people are
gonna hate that we're doing another
fuckin remake of thing what do we do
that's not women
we just call anyone I hate to the sexist
it's easy it's easy it's easy oh yeah
yeah
oh my god they back-end was open look
and how you're supposed to know that I
mean once he got in there because that's
the puzzle rich
because that's the puzzle
Joop to do scoop the dupe well shit
now I was fuckin around
why did you do that cuz let's fuckin
around
why did you do that why was I fuckin all
be fuckin around show that was the game
I like to fuck around they have some
level of fun but
yeah I like the did you see the jfet Sam
oh yeah I just saw I like I like the
jfet Sam oh because you know it can be
used anywhere that's just a moat that
says Wadden I love that a moan I saw I
saw that still image from the best of
the worst and I was like there's the jmo
and I was waiting I was waiting for the
perfect jaya mode and it came to us yeah
I co read that one because I think that
that goes into my people are buying into
the sexism thing none of us says reminds
me when Warner Brothers Studio came out
before Batman vs Superman and claimed
people may not like it because it was
too smart or something or other yeah but
people no one bought into that bullshit
you know one everyone everyone out dogs
well depending upon your politics you're
buying into this one example that's what
I'm saying I'm saying people are falling
for their ruse for their don't you know
don't be a sexist like the movie rooting
for their team instead of you know
analyzing issues and things point by
point and well that's how I feel about
this because I have analyzed it's just
what is what are we supposed to feel
about this what am i what am i leaders
say that's what I feel we can't have we
have no emote room left for a juicy Shaq
meet a moat we would have to get rid of
something to get the juicy Shaq meet a
moat and I don't know you know the only
thing left to get rid of that's
non-essential I feel is Jesus
we need 40 more subscribers get out of
people get on it no if we good
that's the best solution if we get 40
more subscribers then we can have more
unless you want me to get rid of Jesus
which I don't know maybe you're okay
with that
oh my god the dockets in the water
Nicky swim under um I'm a weekend a
little bit but see slow okay I'm hoping
that slows them down enough run faster
kid it's stupid kid oh oh get those
boards off as fast you can
they're going around jack Hannah they're
going around they're going around
oh no oh I thought I could get that
second one off free DJ I was greedy I
got creative greedy fucking deserve I
got greedy not the G I know everyone
likes the Jesus I like the Jesus I think
he's rich it's gonna be twice they're
gonna have to run around in the third
time like when you get the last word
hole gates from you gonna fall over
something y'all go fast okay one at a
time one other thing one at a time
Jesus Christ says
do not get rid of me please come on
doggies
that's fuckin brutal you know what I
still have not seen bridesmaids I've
heard nothing but positive things about
bridesmaids and I have not seen again I
really need to see you should unite the
sheepdip well that feels great but
bridesmaids I've I've heard nothing but
good things about just like Deadpool
just one just one hand
I thought that that I thought that I was
a little slow on the climb last time as
I believe what my problem was I should
be able to slip through but I'm not
gonna do that because I want them on the
other side of the fence
dog sit down
I feel like the least essential emote is
lion brain it serves the same function
as crocodile brain so you don't need
both well remember we used lion brain
has now morphed into that means a good
thing and crocodile meat brain means
you're dead being dumb right it of
course it does mean the same thing Oh
duh he didn't he didn't survive that TV
any story fault he didn't grab on to the
ledge I wanted him there you know so
like when you when you're a lion brain
you're being really smart and when
you're a crocodile brain you're being
really dumb do it to a strawpoll who
wants to see lion brain removed and
replaced with juicy shag mate
I swear to god someone do a strawpoll
and no weird jokey third option just
those two doesn't hand
I'm gonna hide over here so the men
don't see me
okay sneak into your submarine now no
Shack meet you need a Josh emote hurry
moon Mary no I'm honest this Josh ever
been on a stream once once josh has been
on one stream has he earned it has he
earned every regular hmm that's it
that's asking the real questions they're
rich he needs to get off his ass and
join us for a stream if he wants a
fucking a boat that's what I'm saying
I see he was on a rocket League stream
and talked about music it was delightful
okay a rocket League yeah yeah I was a
rocket League strength oh maybe he's
been on - that sounds right now cuz he
was also on the n64 stream so perhaps
he's been on two streams now still is
that enough to earn him an emot-- also
he's just part of the red letter media
team yeah yeah Bing Bing you mean Gigi
oh no and I'm being devil's advocate
here where it's like oh you know like do
we need a Josh Moe maybe we have too
many things that we want
Crocs days lion goes is that what
they're saying oh this was someone so
you guys I mean technically
theoretically speaking you know we we
rarely use line brain and crocodile
brain anymore you know like we could get
rid of both just croc need to go this
all says you know we could just that
that could just be a thing we could just
get rid of both we're at this croc need
to go so far let it go longer 21 votes
for yes how many toes do I say for no 21
for yes for for no 42 for what for no it
doesn't need to go oh really
yeah I want the fuck it out they want
that over Shaq mate isn't what I think
that means Wow check it later but that's
that's pretty that's pretty comfortable
margin absolutely I feel like the a Josh
emote quite until you get the 40
subscribers juicy Shaq meat is a
necessity hmm to be fair Jack tim has
never been in the stream and he has an
emote that's true and you know what I
got rid of him yeah I got rid of Tim to
give you Jay oh there you go okay I
listen to popular demand and got rid of
Tim to give you Jay even though they
don't know Tim I loved I know I loved
that to me mode that was just for me
that was just a me thing how do you even
do juicy Shaq meters a tiny emo it I've
no idea Shaq's face I guess you can't do
jack Shaq's face oh there's nothing we
can't do well they I thought they wanted
like the chicken with the eyes on it the
chicken like with the eyes was the juicy
Shaq man would you want a juicy Shaq
made that doesn't have Shaq's face would
you be basically would you be happy with
the cartoon chicken leg with the eyes
from the t-shirt would that be enough
you yeah and and they they will you have
to submit also like a larger
and they do screen it for like if you
use the celebrities face I got I got
flagged one of the very first emotes
that I wanted to use was Rick Berman and
I said no celebrity faces yeah so it
can't it can't be Shaq got lots of nose
so yeah yeah Tim is more than poop again
timmi timmi is fantastic he was he was
just recently in our latest past me a
beer video and Timmy's the grave yes
that means we can't do the Reagan photo
either no we can't do the Reagan file
definitely not yeah no uh no copier you
know a person's face is a copyrightable
dealy-bob I love Timmy Higgins he's the
best was it was Tim without the mustache
there jacket I know it was just wrong I
know I know I know no one recognized him
up come on
sometimes I have a feeling this game
just wants you to die horrific Lee which
I guess I'm lucky hit the button and run
can't you use a person's face if you get
their permission yes okay if you go get
our shacks permission for a juicy shack
me t-bone will go right ahead on that
absolutely
someone get all the shack someone get
right ahold of Shack they saying that
Jesus and a celebrity theoretically
speaking if the makers of that SOS video
wanted to come after us for infringing
on their intellectual property they
could well they're horrible colors I
know obviously that's not gonna work you
keep trying what well no no last time I
tried to run back and then run over it
this time I try I was thinking maybe I
could grab on to the door as it went up
that was my okay that was my idea
there's gotta be something I can't open
the open that gate back up is there a
great yet fallen I don't believe so
unless I can open this great up no I
can't open that back up I already tried
that
so this guy jump on you know that opens
the doors and the things roll after me
let's just try running and see how far I
can get
oh I see I see oh did you see the door
opens you got a slide in the door I see
I just timed it wrong I got it I got it
well we're not the hell was that what
the hell were you doing I was trying to
get in the door I think that's what I
was supposed to do I don't know I didn't
see a door that time
there's a door that flaps open on that
first one see Oh on the actual Oh or I'm
just supposed to fall oh I guess I'm
just supposed to fall just maybe you
could we just never have a timing right
no no no there was a door on the thing
that I think I thought I had to slide
under but apparently I just needed to
fall and then I'm fine
so I know Jack thought of that comic
books or oh my god did you we haven't
talked about that you've seen it right
which that SF de breeze oral history on
comic book publishing I saw when you
talked about the image comics I believe
or 90s comics at least oh my god no the
while back so remember this is good this
is an old thing SF debris or de bris
does this like thirteen part video
series and it's basically like just him
talking he has very weak visuals but
it's just him giving an oral history of
comic book Publishing's mostly centered
around Marvel and their spin-offs of
image and and valiant and it is
fan-freaking-tastic I think Oh bother
you're the one who yeah you sent it to
me great oh my god I was hooked on this
series it's so fantastic it actually got
me to read a bunch of valium comics I
remember they were quality back in the
day the there's a new run I'm catching
up on a
xiu'er could never catch a break that's
that's the whole thing that was
literally marvel I love Marvel under Jim
shooter he got hosted from Marvel and
then he started valiant valiant was good
that he got houses yeah man could not
catch a fucking break and it ruined
comics Oh long run yeah and then he only
it was almost able to buy Marvel back
during their bankruptcy but was yep a
million short a fantastic SF debris
spell tout de bris look it up it is
fan-fucking-tastic fantastic thank you
so much for for sending that my way Oh
bother
really really dug it
this isn't gonna be good
oh we know okay I've been I've been
catching up on Archer and Armstrong the
new series the 2012 series Arthur not
strong which is really good and then now
I just started reading those Oh
well apparently they're they're in a
reboot and I just started reading
Harbinger which is also pretty pretty
neat did it claim self those characters
everyone's dead because they were bought
by a video game company you know it
clearly didn't do anything with any of
those characters other than Turek
dinosaur hunter a claim a claim was
running valiant for a while they bought
them yeah and now they're now valiant is
it something again I think they still
owned by acclaim that's a good question
I don't know I don't know but it's it's
really good comics really really good
stories and really good art and the
mixture you know like I'm constantly
surprised by how good the art end
stories are in Valiant Comics I'm Kenny
Powers sense I'm Kenny Powers
hey Jack and Jack and rich and rich
hello who are your favorite talk show
host
do you like Conan or Colbert how about
me Kenny Powers the the answer to that
question is Johnny Carson I think they
meant was on now hey I I honestly don't
watch TV hardly ever
but you'll catch four clips the next day
I do does John Oliver count as a talk
show host he does indeed he doesn't do
though I've only seen his clips on
YouTube I haven't seen full show because
I don't have the HBO's I think you know
it full episodes on his yep oh I miss
you on his YouTube channel okay cuz I've
just seemed like clips I could post it
here and there okay you're always funny
mm-hmm
I know I like Conan back in the day he's
still good yep still good still doing it
Johnny Carson was dead before I was born
nope always reminded that I'm old it's
inescapable Wow some sound was the same

Samantha bee Daily Show correspondent
Samantha bee full-frontal she's getting
good too chanting no guests oh he's
technically not a talk show you know
I've always thought those were the
weakest part of the lecture yes that's
true right I'm not disagreeing with it
no Samantha B has some good stuff daily
show I just haven't seen
I've watched a little bit of it and
didn't quite feel it which what's it
like being old that's a fair coin
everything just starts hurting simple
things getting up sitting down walking
there's a lot more aches and pains
associated with these normal everyday
activities than there used to be and
then there's the hair hmm yeah preach it
but preacher I started losing that
relatively early it's fine everything's
fine
try to stay in the best health he can
whoever was trying to quit smoking you
quit fucking smoking or else your old
age is gonna suck smokers who are all
just not living miserable miserable
lives probably reach them star arbol
says I'm 35 and I can't sleep in my left
side anymore my shoulder hurts too much
yeah it's the shit like that
that just ruins your life it's that way
forever now forever forever that doesn't
go away
I don't know if I needed to go back in
here but I wanted to be safe
yeah yeah I don't care if Jon Stewart is
in the ultimate cut of Batman vs
Superman I'm still not gonna watch for
the ultimate cut of Batman vs Superman
how about that that's the kind of thing
like I've been willing to watch clips
online of what they added but I don't
care enough to watch the whole movie
with that I didn't like the movie enough
to watch the whole movie with just some
new shit all right
premiere give me a list of what's
different and I'll be happy I dyed it
yep
I think no you know what Hulk keeps you
though that's leftover beefcake standing
up every hour boom we should probably
stand up I haven't been you know why
because I've been walking around
everywhere for my fucking program on my
legs four times you can find a Pokemon
in the other room should I go with Jack
quick Jack turn on your Pokemon Go app
okay hold on I'm gonna see if we do it
Pokemon can we get them can we do a
mobile stream can you stream from your
phone I don't believe you can not now
anyway YouTube is working on a way of
streaming from your feet we need to do a
mobile Pokemon go stream you're just
walking around and I'm following you and
you're catching pokémon okay
here's how we do it yeah if I if i hook
up my phone to my computer via a
lightning cable I can record what
happens on my phone on my computer if we
have a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot can we do
that yes we're doing this are we yes why
not well do it earlier stream won't do
it tonight we'll do an afternoon stream
I'm absolutely down with it let's
totally go downtown and we'll just look
for Pokemon downtown yeah but like you
you understand like we have to hold a
laptop computer open and the phone open
no that last type will need to be open
in order to stream everything no it'll
need to be open open why so it continues
to run when a laptop is closed it calls
we don't close it all the way we've
rigged it so I can't close I don't think
it'll work we have to do this okay I
guess what I'm saying is I'm down you
can stream from your phone Tiberius Kirk
says in all caps can we
I've never hold on I'm checking to see
if my if the app is working when I went
out right when I got here when I was
just down the street I was in the middle
of catching a piggy and the server's
crashed yeah and so hope it's back up

stop right there hold on it's loading
it's loading everything I don't see any
Pokemon really nearby though but I'm
just gonna stretch my legs for a little
bow be right back Ola get some drink or
something at it there's a special thing
just for this just for such occasion oh
we never set it up there's hey Everett
hold on everybody
there's a special thing j-just for
situations like this when when we both
get up I made a very special thing and
we never implemented it hold on hold on
pause let's see if we can get this to
work live on camera
I think this is the thing we need and
then if we go like that you go like that
hold on this isn't gonna be nearly as
cool as you as as you think it's going
to be because this should have just been
something that I like had
but just what's gonna happen it's just
what's gonna happen
I'm we're gonna get there and then I'm
gonna stand up it's gonna be great it's
gonna be great it's gonna be great I
made a little thing but I have no idea
where every anything on Ritchie's
computer is rich where's everything on
your computer all the streaming folder
no I need to look in your in your thing
here yeah okay I see I see boom
see look I made a little I made this
little I made a gift rich I made a
little gift for us hold on we're gonna
move it down and we're gonna move and
then and then we turn the game off watch
this this is gonna be great
well I specifically made it like the
color of the background to like make it
blend in like this okay see isn't that
great and then it says we'll be back and
it's us dancing I did not make that
pixel art gif of us someone someone else
made that but I think it's adorable
I think it's adorable and I love it wait
I do want to move this like under
I'll move this under the blue thing
there we go perfect there isn't that
great isn't that adorable it will move
it down to the bottom here so we're like
great great so now when we go when we go
and walk and stretch our legs people
will know that uh it's not as good as
all the red border you had a few weeks
ago that red border was great I know
okay alright now we'll be back I'm gonna
go check for Pokemon I'll be back and
research my legs
you
you
hey everybody I even muted the
microphones ah there's no Pokemon near
the studio at the moment I did run
outside really quick to see if I could
catch one but because I thought that'd
be funny do they actually move around or
they just kind of appear and disappear
what do you mean the pokemons like in
the world yes yeah well I mean they
appear in an area and then they I think
they do move around yes in the world I
mean this world well I do like I mean do
they slowly move around or it's just one
Sun on this block this intersection
it'll be there for 30 minutes that it's
gone uh yes I do believe it's like that
okay but I don't know for sure I'll be
honest with you I don't know the extent
of it I want to know what kind of
Pokemon hang out by the bronze fonts we
can go okay hold on can we can i stream
from the app can I scream from the
twitch app i'm opening up the app right
now how do we stream from our phone why
don't we look into this okay I will look
into this as a stream yep okay okay hold
on here hmm all right where is this game
this game
okay back to it rich I see a streaming
app for twitch on Android but not iPhone
okay well I know you know what we could
do it from basically if I get a really
if I get a long enough lightning cable
and have someone just holding the laptop
open I believe it's an Android I'm
saying there's a way we can do this with
a laptop and it's not like you'll see us
on camera anyway I suppose we could use
the laptop camera as long as we had a
full battery we could we could probably
stream for an hour or so I guess what
I'm saying is it's doable it is it is
doable so we will look into it we need
someone to hold the laptop someone
obviously to hold the phone I mean the
laptop battery would last a good while
walk it walking around I think that's
just gonna be the hard part is we'll be
walking around for an hour
just pull the laptop on a wagon I'm sure
there's I'm sure there's someone working
about bar I'm excited about this idea
only because it means that I get to play
pokemon go more yeah the zoo yeah oh man
that would be great Jack you gotta go
get that Pikachu he's right in the
middle of the a2 enclosure Oh God you've
got to go get it oh look at that look at
that look at that
well that's freaky as shit
so light keeps of that bag apparently do
me a favor yeah just take a light off of
it I want to see how it murders you it
cracks the glass all right
I assumed I needed to keep the light on
it but you're right we should have
tested that that was a good that was
good to test curious what happened great
cuz every other death has been great
that is very very creepy
Camille October oh yes our no problem
yeah I promise never before hey I see
what you're doing you Japanese ghost kid
Hey oh but I can't see the tip because
do you alt-tab hey pause it in alt-tab I
want to see a couple tips that aren't
showing up here it is a laptop sure
these ready I'm kami powers fable okay
took your paper will says took you a
recommendation to watch Fargo great
great show fucking hell yes season one
blew me away with its awesomeness season
two WTF I'm not reading the rest of that
your thoughts Fargo
well I'm running it spoiled for me Oh
have you not seen it no and and it's
it's not necessarily a spoiler bud yeah
it's you know it's not not a spoiler
okay
it's amazing TV i season one for me is
way more enjoyable
I think the acting in season two is far
better but I don't much care for the
story like the season 1 story is just
classic Fargo yeah it's beautiful
everyone should watch Fargo if you can
and I'm Kenny powerses hello again has
anyone from rlm seen the nice guys
exquisite film and you should review it
also I can carry your laptop
that's what well kid thought of you that
are the special one-day intern carry a
shit while we streamed Pokemon a camera
at us - I think we just have to use the
camera on the laptop all right again for
simplicity sake Shh well if we have an
intern OS opposed they can play a
fucking camera your laptop will get the
web will get the webcam out of this
gonna be so fucked right it'll be great
um no I have not seen the nice guys Mike
or Jay might have I have not seen it I
really want to see it it's looking like
one of those movies that I'm gonna just
have to wait until it comes on demand
because I can't get out very much cuz I
got kids
no having kids is a great idea just that
is not the way to go
just means I can't go out as much
Brammer would do sub uh you know what
actually that's not a bad idea I love I
love that they knew you were gonna do
that
oh I see I see what I have to do I have
to close this door and close her in it
we're not or not or not or not I'm not
you did great they're great great shit I
need to I need to close her in an area
Oh I've you know what I probably need to
close her in the other side and then
where's the thing you need to do huh
where's the thing what section do you
need to be in to the right you should
figure this out how do you know know cuz
I got there already
maybe the rights where you need to trap
her maybe that's why the rights there
I'm I'm gonna I'm going to assume hey
cake says Jack rich what do you think
about the new chairs feature in twitch
for tips donations and annoying animated
gif badges what have you have you seen
this at all I haven't seen gifts yet
what's gone just explain it okay so we
have we have the stream tips right yeah
and basically how that works is you know
someone pays through PayPal and gives us
a little money we read a tip twitch has
realized that they could have their own
version of stream tip and make that make
that PayPal money on on their end
because I mean PayPal gets a little cut
of every stream tip yeah
and so they are initiating cheers which
is you as a viewer buys these little
crystals that are called cheers and then
you can give a streamer a cheers and a
little animated Cristal gift pops up in
chat and you can say something to them
and you pay money to twitch and then you
can give a little cheers yeah and that's
it which gets the money and tweet well
twitch gets that percentage and the
streamer yes the Milka gets the money so
then like let's say I as a viewer buys
10 dollars worth of diamonds or crystals
or whatever right and I give $2 to this
guy I give $2 to this guy get to know
this guy they still you know like they
would get like a buck 80 you'll get 20
cents then get a buck 80 you know yeah
so these streamers are still getting the
same amount of money but some garbage is
being added into the chat and now twitch
gets the cut
unlike PayPal okay I'm not bothered by
it I'm not I'm not happy with with
taking over the chat only because the
way only because we've already worked
out how we do it yeah and I'm sure
someone will come up with some sort of
API to where it will change very little
for us but I don't want
I like the chat being simple like it's
already crazy I'll agree it's the chat
is already crazy with the modes and
memes and stuff like that I just want to
make sure that chat stays simple yeah no
beef kata beefcake and who's figuring
that out with your beefcake someone
someone else in on our Twitter when the
news broke they were trying to like
figure out all the API and all the
percentage cuts and everything and it
was like they did some work on yeah the
beefcake is looking into it it was it's
it's intense sand supposedly this is a
short game apparently we can finish in
one sitting I don't know if we will just
this guy you know that's who it was
thanks beefcake yeah beefcake in just
this guy you know we're figuring out the
the ins and outs of the cheers thing and
obviously twitch is trying to streamline
their organization and they see a way to
make money so good for them you know
we're not trying to take away their
money and you know what if it works
better they give us a platform
absolutely if they want that money
instead of letting PayPal have that
money yeah it's fine oh absolutely
no and you know what if it's integrated
into the system it might work a little
bit better because you know we have
problems with PayPal every once in a
while
wait a minute you need to get that other
guy down there there's some other guy on
there I guess I'm sure 19 huh
jump on it oh my god you need to get a
lot of guys on that if what I think is
going on let's go my god my guess is
there's a big thing here I think that
opens that baby well okay let's go back
over here because there's that elevator
that wasn't powered up here we go here's
the thing let's see what happens if we
go up what if we've been talking about
we've been talking about the the the tip
the the twitch tips about know something
about Pokemon go we started off the
evening talking about Mike and Dave need
wedding dates I got a chance to meet
miss Aubrey Plaza who I've worked with
before she did not remember but that's
okay
have you ever seen Parks and Rec no I
you know I haven't either
Aubrey Plaza is the she's one of the
female leads of Mike and Dave nude
wedding dates
she's the snarky secretary in Parks and
Rec and you know just an actress a young
Hollywood actress and she was nice
enough to come to the Milwaukee premiere
the friends-and-family premiere so I got
to hang out with her for a little bit
and by hang out I mean sit at the same
table and not say anything to her I
talked to her a little bit was where you
came from was that the bottom floor yeah
or the middle floor or the bottom floor
there's three levers all right no I'm
just saying what's up here okay
I open this no l argentino says just
finished watching Bojack horseman and
must say was depressing the ex the
existentialist trip and I loved every
second of it I'm sorry tripe
existentialist tripe or it could be a
trip I haven't even know could have been
an existentialist yeah and I loved every
second of it joke aside loved it thanks
rich for the recommendation you're on
them yeah you were really into that yes
my my cut my cousin Jake directed Mike
and Dave need who needs wedding dates
and Jake is the guy who I used to do
stand-up comedy with I used to make
comedy videos with with Funny or Die he
is my cousin we were in each other's
weddings we've been best friends since I
was born cuz he was born one week before
me so so I of course loved the movie
mostly because we have a unnaturally
similar sense of humor Jake and I and so
I thought it was very funny obviously
I'm incredibly biased but that's okay
I'm probably gonna need a bunch of guys
down here to pull this shit I'm not
gonna speak for Jack but I don't hate
this I think people expect me to hate
this because it's hard oh yeah it's an
acceptable puzzly platformer mm-hmm with
some really creepy ambiance mm-hmm
ambiance ambience
ambient so here we go he was a thing
it's fine whoa-ohh you they can go down
again oh my god there's so many elevator
this campus elevator action it's the
spiritual sequel to all the interaction
there there is a this is that oh that
might fuck me why isn't there a well I
think bitch there is a sequel the
elevator era I don't know if I was ever
released in the u.s. elevator action was
great
oh here's a bunch of guys this is the
this is the biggest puzzle room we have
yet to come across hopefully there's a
way back up fuck ourselves that hasn't
happened yet
i'ma get trapped oh my god this is this
is dumb okay here we go listen sometimes
sometimes you just gotta go rich
sometimes you just gotta go
sometimes it's the wrong choice but you
still just gotta go I have not played
Dustin Elysian tail but if that's the
game I'm thinking of I wouldn't mind
trying it if that's what I'm thinking
everything as an action 2d platformer
okay there's another game called dust
you're like a janitor that runs around
some really hard platforming levels so
there's some dust confusion because
there's two side-scrolling 2d games
called dust something-or-other oh sure
I'm not sure which one they're
referencing but
no who
yeah oh that's not a rope I can grab
the other game is called dustforce okay
okay dust for dust dust dust dust and
more dust what a dust oh oh I get it so
now it's now it's turning into odd world
this is fun weird can you take the
humming off cause you don't want fresh
them in the elevator
my guess is they won't fall off yeah no
good reason they follow every other move
you did because because of game rich
yeah yeah because that's how the puzzle
is solved
get on dickheads
I liked on world I remember I tried
playing it on stream and it turned out
to be a not good stream but I remember
really liking odd world you remember
lots of stupid things Jack that's also
very true I remember a lot of stupid
stupid things
everybody's gonna be in Spiderman lying
flat Len have you got have you seen let
every single day there's a new
announcement for who's gonna be in
spider-man and it's fucking everybody
everybody's in spider-man my guess is I
need to put this here where the hole
drops right sure oh but there's also
this but I can't really climb on it hmm
yeah you know let's just see what
happens if we move it further most tests
and let's test things out
I'm guessing an ends of the track okay
yeah so then then it definitely goes
under the hole right there great great
what's the stream email is it prereq at
red letter media yeah that's our email I
don't know if that's the stream email I
don't know what that means that it that
is our email our stream has its own
email right oh that's right these guys
can lift me up come on shoot me
I know I'm supposed to go down there but
I just wanted to can I open other things
nope
hey oh they moved it can you take off
the helmet not that I know of but I will
hold on I will try alright
wait they they they automatically push
it right they automatically push it push
your back further what do you mean
pull it back further than the hole so
we're kind of moving it with you like
they're gonna push it anyway right I
mean oh sure I get it I don't know if
I'm supposed to go now I just kind of
want to here we go
I also jumped on the other side of it
maybe I wasn't supposed to do that
a no-ho-ho remote that would be great
oh-ho-ho nope I was totally wrong and
now you're sucking shit shit unless you
had to get on the other side of that was
keep going keep going Jackie yeah look
I'm supposed to jump up there I was
supposed to get in it that's a great way
of dying though innit I mean it's nice
to know that you can die it's nice to
know that you can okay listen up
dickheads it's gonna shit together get
our shit together hey why aren't you
jumping I'm jumping yeah there's like a
platform up there that I think I can get
on if I can get on top of this thing
here
come on two kids
also along with a bunch of valium comics
I've been I've been trying really hard
to read none superhero comics yeah it's
something I've been I've been really
working on because I know I've know I've
not read prettier I'm waiting I'm
waiting to get that from you you need to
ask me to bring them in I ask you every
single time they were sitting here the
studio so long I eventually just took
them home
there's nobody was doing anything with
that I I read a really great book called
rat Queens huh
that is a like medieval fantasy setting
and it stars for female mercenaries you
know a major war e'er a dwarf and it's a
really good read really fun book and so
that was a you know technically like
they have powers like same with Archer
and and Armstrong like they have power
is not necessarily a superhero book but
me you know kinda is bringing up why the
last man okay which I've read it mmm
horrible letdown of an ending but

hello guys on a pole but rat Queens was
a really fun read nope nope nope
hmm
hmm or ehk says I didn't make it further
than volume 2 of why just didn't grab me
I made it further than vol 2 I will say
the like the first issue of why is
pretty fucking amazing
it starts off great why it does not it
just it's like it's like they jump off
of the the vault and there's a terrific
amazing somersault in the air but they
like land and like uh he they just
completely completely fuck up the land
and break their break their nose twist
their ankle
