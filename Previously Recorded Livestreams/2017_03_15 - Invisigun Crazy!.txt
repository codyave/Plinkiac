here you can take that oh you know what
I forgot to do a thing that I wanted to
do what the thing was that here I
thought I'd be super smart rich so right
before we started the stream we filmed
our Legend of Zelda breath of the wild
discussion yeah and I brought with me my
laptop and my harddrive because
something that takes a bit of time is
ingesting all the footage yeah like all
you know we three cameras you gotta
ingest all the footage you gotta train
you transpose to ProRes and not at all
it's tough so I was like hey I'll do
that while we stream oh my god and well
it'll it will literally save me like two
hours tomorrow
and so I can start editing faster and I
just forgot to do it so I'm sorry that's
all right I'm SuperDuper sorry we can't
play more Zelda cuz we didn't bring the
switch enjoyed it though enjoyed the
fuck out of Zelda yeah good game it's a
good game that Zelda that Zelda is a
fine game was most of the discussion
talking about the weapon braking system
know a fair amount of it though as I
didn't like it an enriched thought it
wasn't appropriate
I thought of work for the kind of game
they were making I mean they could have
stand it added a little bit like 25 to
50% more durability I think that's my
gut feeling on every weapon across the
board but yeah it was fine and
yeah I thought I hit quit quit weird
great great all right hey let's see what
you know we have a shit ton of games we
can play another game we can play like
another game if I can't go too late
mostly because I don't want my face to
explode midstream
yes we have this so need to win that
missile only FTL run I never claimed I
was going to win a missile only FTL run
just that I was going to try one and
that it would be a disaster which it
obviously was because a missile only run
right I think that was kind of a
disaster
Oh guys I would love to play Isaac oh
I'll tell you what though waiting to
play it on the switch alright I'm gonna
wait play it on the switch because uh
kind of looking forward to playing that
mobli interview the Angry Video Game
Nerd about his crappy movie he released
a few years ago we're in no place to
talk to any web celebrity about their
crappy movie that made themselves hey
ain't got nothing against the angry
video game nerd I ain't got nothing
against no one Vice City I see I see I
see oh we don't have it installed you
talking about grand theft auto vice city
somebody suddenly something someone a
robe like I didn't take a look at it
might be good I've been too busy play as
much as old as I can that was the point
that was the plan I I actually I beat I
beat Zelda probably 20 minutes before I
can
I was really close and then I powered
through did we see that screen junkies
ripped off nerd crew yes I did see that
it was kind of sad really
they did a a fake overpraising podcasts
it's it's honestly shameful
the the really upsetting part is they
had on there I don't know if you if you
if you've ever seen her stuff what's her
name Jenny
chat channel know what her name is and
put it in the chat her name I got I
guess it certainly wasn't personal
because I just haven't watched much of
their stuff so I don't know who you're
talking about
there there's there's this youtuber
named Jenny someone please say what her
name is Jenny from the block yeah it was
a you know what I was embarrassing Jenny
sent what's her last name anybody
oh Jenny Nicholson her name is Jenny
Nicholson she well she makes really fun
videos yeah and she she has fun thought
peace videos and they had her on to do
this like fake podcasts overpraising
record crew thing and it's like oh it
was just sad rich is what it was it was
just sad and I saw that crop up online
and I felt sorry for them because it was
so bull Aidan boom I wanna watch this
I'm stream yeah you wanna leave you want
to watch it I'm curious what they did
can someone link to it and someone link
to it who cares
somebody link to this thing someone link
to it no well and that was upsetting for
me because I'm like I I'm a subscriber
to Jenny's channel and I watch her stuff
all the time and I think she's very
funny but
then she was on this thing and it's like
that almost soured me on her and was
like oh don't do that
that's stops growing I want to click on
this up curly I got a stupid touchpad
can't do anything with a touchpad did
you do it
oh Jesus Christ turn which is watching
it right now
all right there bit is talking about
saying like a second to footage right no
they're saying they watched a clip
mm-hmm their bit is reading people's
tweet okay and and using the tweets to
talk about Star Wars footage okay okay
that's the bit see no no you got you got
a fake one second two footage and
wouldn't be easy to do because you have
to fake one second a foot if you did a
second of footage the tiniest glimpse of
a lightsaber and like it's the clip has
to be less than a second long yeah that
you're overanalyzing yeah that's how you
do that in the comedy the the idea is
that they're over analyzing someone else
talking about footage they saw which I
think doing it that way
they're too fucking lazy you're stupid
to make a fake clip I'm I'm not
disagreeing with you
yeah I wouldn't make it a minute in yeah
I technically I'm at one minute and one
second and I went to click pause not
even thinking about it like the one
minute mark at the one minute mark on
what to go pause like oh it's that one
minute exactly yeah so I made it one
minute yeah you sucked in Wow Wow sucked
in right let's not go there I don't want
to
we're warring with screen junkies I got
nothing against some I got I got nothing
personal nothing personal against them
and like I said I'm that lady in the
middle I like her YouTube videos I think
she's very funny she had a really good
one for Suicide Squad where she talked
about just the practicality of forming
such a squad yeah and she's funny she's
generally funny
hold on
J was freaking on spring onions but no
Janos one of the people who produces or
is on screwed right jig is Jay's friends
with them so no it's not there's nothing
personal against them and you know what
there is also here's I'm gonna I'm gonna
get larger wrench there is nothing wrong
with taking inspiration from someone
else's bit and turning it into something
I don't think they did it as well and I
don't think they turned it into their
own thing but hey you know what there is
nothing wrong with it yeah well the
other thing is like they they did not
set up the bit properly where if the bit
was going to be instead of analyzing
footage we are going to analyze someone
talking about footage right
they weren't they have footage of
themselves talking about footage that
they could have used
well you overanalyze your own Jedi
Council episode oh I like that
that would have been funny right well no
but they didn't get into the bit fast
enough if the bit was like okay this
tweet says saw some footage and it was
amazing let's take this word by word ah
Mei Xing does that mean there's gonna be
a maze in Star Trek Star Wars does that
mean it's gonna start with the letter A
what do we know about the maze like they
didn't get into the bit fast enough is
is the problem
what is this this is in visiting he rose
now they gonna cut started us hi I have
a parent there's a little tutorial thing
that I need to get through so the give
with this game is it's a multiplayer
game so I plugged in a second controller
in which all the players are invisible
okay and we have to fight each other but
we're invisible inspired heavily so as
you see now I'm running around but I'm
invisible but I just bumped into wall so
if I bump into a wall you can see me
bump into a wall but I know I can't see
you you people actually want to see more
Zelda I have nothing against playing
whores olap we can do that about we do
we can't do it tonight the problem is we
weren't we weren't encouraged to play
more Zelda because going from Oh game
audio is too loud if you remember going
from one to switch to Zelda lost us a
few hundred viewers really yeah you
hundred a couple a couple hundred
hundreds of viewers are you shitting me
mods double double check my math if I
remember correctly going from one to
switch to Zelda lost us a couple hundred
years because I think people didn't want
spoilers oh that makes sense yeah and
everyone's doing Zelda right and so we
were not encouraged to do more Zelda and
we shed 200 viewers and minutes Tiberius
Thank You Tiberius I can't give you any
more ones whose which because I gave it
to gamestop plate play Doom I can't I
can't switch gears that fast the last
like two and a half to three weeks of my
life has been split between horizon zero
dawn
Zelda breath of the wild I think trying
to play doom right now would just be
like getting hit in the head with a
brick not because I don't like doom I
fucking love doom but so different oh
god right so different I would get
whiplash on error right
yeah and horizon and Zelda had via were
you know FEMA Lee very similar totally
different but had a very similar themes
yeah I think Sunday will do near
autonomy mama Nero tied up I'm at a man
that'll be a fun one autumn Nier
automata yes well I think it's out on pc
friday my brain might be too fried to do
a review on that I don't mind streaming
it yeah will stream it and you know what
will change your mind your mind I think
we've done that before
jump over the wall can we even upload
the one to switch and Zell the streams
to YouTube since Nintendo was a bunch of
dicks well it'll make that much money on
the YouTube videos honestly we'll put
them up so we'll probably flag them if
anyone
we just don't monetize those exactly if
ever anyone noticed that they're unable
to watch the WWE stream on YouTube it's
because WWE flagged it and so they
control we're behind on our YouTube
videos yeah I was playing the wild and I
completely lost track of time and I
noticed it was 5 a.m. I was like oh shit
I need to cut up those YouTube videos
and I was legitimately going to do that
today
Oh while I'm ingesting footage tomorrow
would you like me to cut up a couple
just just to give us a couple days all
right I'll do that
I I mean I I have to take time to ingest
anyways you guys are on patreon who
cares if it gets to monetize red letter
media is on patreon prereq is not
so mainly for me me it's mainly for me
even if you don't monetize it yourself
Nintendo's claim will turn it on for
them that's true well then we pull on
Jim sterling and we we insert like some
copy written songs a small star I love
it I know you're an all-star over the
only YouTube video we have a title
screen form I think we need like maybe
like Nickelback I don't know if Smash
Mouth does it like you know like someone
who's a real who's a real prick alright
hey grab a controller what oh my god I
will just this is standard alright so
you had a tutorial and I didn't I feel I
need to point out metallica metallica
reading with a chat is saying for oh yes
metallica will certainly okay so press a
button and choose your hero i don't know
who anything with any of these people do
what he looks awesome
when okay so as you see you move with
the arrows a is your gun and bees your
special ability i don't know what your
special ability is okay you are
invisible unless you go through water
bump into a wall or fire okay as am i
let's just fucking do it let's do it
Boyd beats I think I tipped like an hour
and a half ago still nothing I didn't
see anything alight hold on I'll take a
look take a look when we switched over
it might have gotten lost in the shuffle
okay hold on before we say ready sorry
hold on Lloyd yeah when I switched over
to me
I don't see anything
lloyd hold on yep I said that one uh
well here's just to catch up on the tips
unit six with read it says hey rich and
Jake I like giving you money because I
realize both our lemon prereq has a lot
of integrity no sponsors you don't take
freebies making them what you want and I
give them for that I give you props you
know we're not against freebies if you
want to give us it's not that I got
really like uncomfortable when I love
Firaxis yeah axis yeah well like they
wanted to send this Laker games
oh noes the civilization beyond that was
when they were making Alpha Centauri
they was just like I can't do that yeah
it makes it a lot easier on us as
critics yeah yeah oh okay here we go a
dish stirrer says you guys should play
wandering Souls I sent a download link
to contact at red letter media but can
give you another link if you need great
game
we'll get that eventually thank you shag
Oh hob 1897 says would you guys ever
consider holding a contest to have
someone sit in on the tapings of best of
the worst
keep the prereq streams and shows coming
no we're a very private internal what
I'm looking for well no we no yeah no no
no like one rich is saying like where we
are actually like we are not necessarily
outgoing people right and I know it's
weird because here we are talking to a
bunch of strangers on the Internet - we
would have no I would like we also like
like the thing we produce and we want to
produce something really good so we
would have no idea if you would be good
at it and that would bother us so no I
think they just want to sit in though
and be in
area and that would still be weird still
be weird
cool trainer leh handi says these two
dollars are mainly for Jack thank you
anonymous says here are some pre
recommend ease for Jack's broken nan
patreon ass go get yourself something

gobbledygook say oh no uhh so yeah
gobbledygook says speaking of bits and
things I'm thinking of changing my name
I'm thinking of changing my name is it

the hill and that's a clean show let me
know if it bothers you gobbledygook s'
gobbly gook like oh my god it's a bunch
of stuff it's a bunch of gobbledygook I
think it's weird that it gets flagged I
don't know why gobbledygook but don't
know I know why why but it's it's own
thing that isn't related the last part
of that the second Jeon yeah but that's
not how you pronounce that I know but
that's if that's why it's getting
flagged the thing that looks at text
sure oh it's thinking like it's spelled
kind of closely to a racial slur yeah
sure I guess I guess don't change it for
us though or else we won't know who you
are gobbledygook
all right let's see here a sewer Dan
forces Rich's constant product shilling

but who knows if it offends people maybe
yeah like gobbledygook s' is a way to
say a big mess of thing yes but the last
part of it if it was just one oh I
wouldn't freaking worry about it don't
damn name don't worry about it it's fine
it's totally fine if your name work kill
all the cooks different that would be a
little different then we'd have to have
a little conversation with you right old
handsaw says Jack I just want to say
good luck with the root canal I'm having
dental cleaning tomorrow bad oral news

feeling much better now I've had I had a
little Tylenol there's a tylenol
downstairs I had a beer so I'm all good
now gobble the gobbledygook is its own
word that is not related to a racial
slur but the last part of it if it you
had the long o sound which is a word I'm
not going to say on stream anybody
anybody who's getting bad out of shape
about that too fucking sensitive about
gobbledygook
about everything

gonna
I've been meaning to play this there is
online mode there's online functionality
I just haven't gotten around to playing
it Shanna God says gobbledygook noun in
formal language that is meaningless or
is made unintelligible by excessive use
of abstruse technical - technical terms
nonsense
yeah yeah company Guk I'll be upset if
you change that name yeah I don't change
it oh yeah you're changing yeah go ahead
change do it do it I'm surprised you
guys never do drinking games on this
stream rich doesn't drink so that would
be a really awkward and I have no
problem drinking alone but like that
Beach is really aquifer rich take a
drink rich did you long in as you when
you bought this fasting this is this
this is on edge okay so so I have this
on each but it is available on Steam I'm
blue now
and I am pink save Wisconsin look at
this guy just big death Reaper oh wait
it's and I tell you what they do drop a
portal teleport yourself contrary small
destructible block in front of you that
reflects a shot that's all oh I think
that's why I was last time I was Carmen
you were Proteus ather furious ground
pound that damages obstacles and stuns
foes Oh iris cover a lot of ground
quickly using a quick short burst of
speed you know I'm gonna try oh you're
gonna be okay no that's all right I'll
be iris all right perhaps my focus right
might reveal something useful yeah see
that's that was a drinking game for a
Jack solo stream that's fine if it's a
Jack soloist room we can do drinking
games start oh I'm up there okay alright
alright get the lay of the land here
Oh
I almost turned that right you get a -
imposed to walk I thought I had you I
thought I had Jim Jack secret is that
he's always drunk no I'm not even I'm
not even drunk now I've only had one
beer tonight
Oh ready
Oh quick on the draw rich there's a
choke point man you got to get to that
choke point right good work jack I felt
good about that I felt good about that
that's gonna be my only kill the whole
game where can I contact twitch to ask
gobbledygook to be whitelisted that's a
great question I do not know the answer
to that question Oh
the tall grass you can move through
ah uh what you a shield
no you do how did I get a shield
I don't know
are you new rich what are you gonna do
yes gotta be quick on the draw I picked
up a shield thing you must have yes it
saved my ass wherever I picked it up
bullshit was that what that powerup was
what is even happening right now rich
and Jack keep vanishing lol well that's
the game is we are you are in stealth
you are invisible unless you bump into
something or shoot right you're
invisible even to yourself and so you
have to remember where you are and try
to figure out where they are this is not
a fun game to watch oh well it's very
fun to play deal with that
oh I thought it was one lower no choke
points did I always want to make videos
and suffer didn't I have it I thought I
was on the space under oh sure oh no I
was I've talked about this before I was
an aimless youth aimless I did not know
I had no idea what I wanted to be for a
very long time and I just kind of fell
into the video making stuff and ended up
really liking it
not no no
oh so the neat thing about this level is
if you see like the tall grass that's
how I kept reorienting myself it's like
running purposefully running into the
tall grass cuz you know like you can see
it Russell yeah but I also see it
Russell that's that's the the trade-off
and so like it's just kind of like
anticipating where they're gonna be in
trying to figure out where they're gonna
be this this is intense
this is great this is great it's great
No
yes you are there yeah oh no idea I
thought you were I thought you were down
there I was waiting for you to move down
there hmm let's see here where are we a
bit a bit of an ass as a Scottish person
says the off switch I can assure you Mel
Gibson is a perfectly fine choice
he and Warner Brothers have a long
history of making films that completely
ignore and insult the source material
well great
ah I'm trying to think of a Mel Gibson
directed movie that I've seen Braveheart
I had in zebra though yeah didn't we
didn't care I don't know how hard the
patriot he directed the Patriot Last
Temptation of Christ since day one I
think he directed the Patriot pretty
damn sure he did very similar to
Braveheart it's what I've heard I've
seen the Patriot but you know I think
he's won awards like he's won accolades
for his directing yeah you give him an
action movie he knows kind of the action
movie structure could be fine I don't
care I don't care I still need to see
the first one game child UK says got
Dead Rising 4 on Steam yesterday on its
own it's ok as a Dead Rising sequel like
rich predicted it's a letdown to
streamlined
fake Frank West and just too damn easy
bring back Psychopaths and timers yes I
know what patriarch the Patriot emmerich
rollin in recorded each other that makes
way more sense that makes movie more
sense
Patriot was Emmerich yes I can see that
already
sure
oh nice where are we go yeah we did that
mr. bucket 88 so speaking of dental work
that's yeah dental work it's a part of
adult life it's been a while since I've
been to the dentist and I have terrible
teeth I had my wisdom teeth removed last
week and all I could think of is how
much I look like Roberts Adar it was
scary
have you had your wisdom teeth out yes
okay yeah that sucks that sucks
Jack example Esquire says hey there I am
a semi old fart who recently stumbled
upon your stream thanks for the
entertainment as I find myself with more
time to play games these days what games
are worth my time well entirely depends
upon what kind of games you like I know
recently both rich and I enjoyed horizon
zero dawn and Zelda breath of the wild
yeah as examples of games that we enjoy
yeah you might like real time strategy
games you might block well you might not
you might like I might oh no yeah no I
could recommend one here here's a game I
have a game recommendation that everyone
loves yeah rocket League yes no matter
what type of gamer you are you will love
rocket League rocket league is fun yes
super fun let's give this one more girl
rich okay what time is it
it's almost it's nine o'clock right now
so I figure if we're giving you know one
more good game we will have to call this
an early stream okay just because I
don't know when my tooth will flare up
again and I do apologize for that
know about jumping oh you just did the
ground pound one oh I did that one I
like that one double damage we die in
one hit why would I need double damage
slash foes and incoming fire to stock up
double damages well what if I get a
shield or something I'm just putting
that out there activate to create a
controllable non-lethal decoy what all
right I'm gonna try I'm gonna try Phoebe
Phoebe drop a portal teleport yourself
or a live shot to it I'm sorry - here -

showbusiness donkey wrestling you know
that sounds like a great password
macho business donkey recipe I was
hearing something about passwords you
know they for shit you gotta use it
number and three capitals and yeah
somebody who does passwords said it's
actually better not to require like the
weird care the numbers or the spaces of
the capitals but just longer strings of
random words that you will remember sure
rather than a string of weird capital G
X is 9 for to capital X because mentally
it's longer yeah and because it's actual
words it's easier to remember and if
you're trying to hack somebody's
password it takes just as long to figure
that out it because there's a lot of
characters sure I've got like a four
simple easy to remember word password
yeah so actually that would be a good
password don't tell anybody
don't tell anybody you know change it up
