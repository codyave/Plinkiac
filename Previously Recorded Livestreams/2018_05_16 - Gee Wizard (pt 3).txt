throw Austin see also ass what do you
think / know about video game addiction
you may scoff but students all around me
drop out of college and damaged their
lives due to seriously not being able to
put the controller down I've dealt with
as well still safer than meth no I don't
I don't have much experience with
somebody who is addicted to games I mean
you know that's that's just any you can
addiction like like I play like you know
I play a lot of games but if I have to
go to work I'm gonna put down the
controller and go to work yeah yeah the
I think these are people who if video
games didn't exist would be addicted to
something else
I can't even even met somebody like this
so you've never met someone who just
can't do anything but gaming who I would
say is a gaming addict no well and
here's why you've never met them they're
inside gaming is they're not outside
meeting new people you're the only other
person I know who is in the game there's
a gamer
yeah damn well that's true but I'm also
not addicted to game so I go out and do
new things which is why you know me I I
have known some people who have dropped
out of my social circles who spend a lot
of time gaming really not necessary not
saying that that's why but what I can
say is as soon as we stopped seeing them
their gaming time because you know we're
still like friends with them online went
way up and so like maybe a little gaming
addiction maybe a little social anxiety
maybe a bunch of things but I do know of
some people and like I said these are
people who would have been addicted to
something else cuz addiction isn't about
the thing it's about the addiction but I
I'm not an expert impaction yeah alright
I think it can be a problem okay
apparently it's a big problem like South
Korea
have you heard those stories of people
who go to like gaming cafes and then
don't 30 actually have heard the same
World of Warcraft or something yeah yeah
or like dota and they like they have to
be carted away in an ambulance because
their legs you no longer work and you're
like what the heck is wrong with you
that's the famous case the old famous
one then that kid who had a heart attack
playing berserk in the arcade but that's
the thing that's an urban legend I don't
know if it's actually true but hey yeah
it can be tough it can be tough I think
even even all of beyond addiction III
think we're going to have a we're gonna
have a creative problem in a few years
you think what I mean not you and me
okay III think there there will be a
generation that is lacking in some
creative fields because there is too
much now that can take up their time
there's so much television there's so
many video games there's so many things
to do and those kids in the 50s or
spending all their time playing you know
marbles they're not gonna be able to do
anything they get older they're just
models marbles marbles what they had
marbles and they had a hoop they're
going on hula hoop bikes
I'm works works not gonna get done
anymore in societies gonna collapse in
that that rock and roll music here's
what I'm worried about rock and/or roll
it's one it's the devil's music and you
know that have you seen him shaking his
hips he's enticing those young ladies
here's okay here's here's what I'm
worried about
I think there is nothing more important
to the creative mind than boredom okay I
think when you are bored as a creative
person it pushes you to do something
exciting and weird and dumb right and I
think we have reached a point where
there is no there's very little ways to
be bored there is so much to take up
your time there are so many things to
take up your time
and then these kids aren't gonna be
bored and so they're never going to do
something dumb
Jack yeah if we've created a society
where we are never bored yeah and all of
our needs are always met well those are
two different things just kind of one at
that point now those are two different
things you got to be bored man being
bored okay when people's needs aren't
being met yeah they're going to need to
go out and be creative no we're like if
your needs are that's not true at all
being bored and having your needs met
are two very different things
Jack you don't you don't think when they
have to go get a nine-to-five job
they're not gonna be bored during that
job the final way to sneaking is some
game playing in the jaw you know they
will they'll sneak it in I guess you
know it's not like a huge concern of
mine but like it sits somewhere like at
least with with like my own children I
do I definitely like make sure to be
like you just know no TV no video games
no nothing just be bored and entertain
yourselves for a little bit figure out
figure out how to just play with your
toys
but that that is very possibly just old
man Jack rantin so try not to read too
much into that sometimes my old man this
comes out more that's fun I know I don't
know that I agree with you I'm leaning
towards old man jack but all right you
know what I'll take it
I'll take old man Jack their kids
nowadays the kids rich playing video
games one there on my lawn he says well
he's playing video games those kids I
just play those video games all day my
favorite line is my favorite line is
when I tell my kids they can't play
video games while I'm currently playing
a video game and they do they point that
out as it is this is for work I'm
working is what you say it's good to be
the adult it's good as I'm working here
kids like they're like can we do this
for work and I was like yeah sure
do it then I won't hassle you none
as I'm here playing video games yeah
what are you gonna do
Tomic mousetrap says fifth edition' is
the easiest addition of the game to
learn so you chose well great without
having to teach you the game three days
is pretty good I hope your family enjoys
it yeah me too me too I I hope we get a
kick out of it I I feel like at this
point like I said I've been I've been
like hardcore studying the books for
like the past six days or so mhm
watching youtube videos watching other
people play campaigns just so it's like
oh wait he just rolled a die there but
he didn't tell me why he rolled to die
but I definitely said like he rolled and
that number meant something okay what
does it mean when you know like Google
like the situation and then I find like
a reddit thread about like these
specific rules oh okay that's that's why
he rolled the dice okay great
so I think I have a basic understanding
of the rules and yeah hopefully I don't
fuck up too bad how do we decide what
game to stream it's literally just
alright you feel like anything what do
you feel like yeah literally that and if
we have a strong feeling you know the
other person says okay or maybe not I
don't think that's a good idea because
right usually usually it's like today I
had I had I want to say I brought rich
for options yeah one got him eliminated
immediately I didn't remember what it
was but I remember imitating and
immediately the that's I got us a Lambo
that wasn't the one that got eliminated
immediately was it yeah him because I
was considering that oh okay the one
what's the what do you suggest
it was the oh you know it was this a
descenders for the record we didn't do
lab oh because we we have to figure out
how to stream that because the actual
switch has to be in the cardboard and we
need so we can't have you guys see
what's on the switch because I word
board and and so we actually need more
camp so that that wasn't me killing that
I would have been fine with it honestly
but it was it was a technical issue
there was a game called descenders which
is a downhill mountain biking game
and I did admit freely that we probably
wouldn't get very much okay I was
thinking I was thinking the next not the
next three I was thinking that's prereq
options you gave me oh sure the one I
shot down we've already talked about the
today Hyrule warriors oh yeah because I
don't I don't want to mindlessly play a
fucking Dynasty Warriors game unless you
want to talk me into it Jack unless you
want to talk me into it it seems like
you really want to play that well I I
guess what I'm saying is I'm gonna play
it no matter what
uh-huh so if we wanted to do an episode
about it that's just the two birds one
stone my my only pitch for you is while
on the surface it does look like you are
mindlessly mowing down enemies and I
suppose on a certain level you are
mindlessly mowing down enemies there is
a greater gameplay element in there
mm-hmm
there's there's bases too free there's
people to help there's there's branching
storylines depending on which area you
help first there's weapon unlocks
there's move unlocks there's leveling up
there's a lot to the dynasty warrior
games besides just the mowing down she
wears the chat what they wanna see us do
revealed next Hyrule warriors rebel
warriors Detroit becomes human the trek
becomes human or battle to battle Tech
right those are your three options chat
that's what I gave to dad
hey Chad that's what I gave to rich what
would you like to see reviewed next for
a full sit-down review for full sit-down
review trade becomes human Hyrule
warriors or battle tech and obviously we
need to do this in a more organized way
I'm seeing more detroit's that I'm
comfortable as a lot of battle tanks
honestly I think battle tech is winning
Jack well I think they want to see you
play that that's true and so they know
by doing an episode you'll have to play
it we do both fuck it we could
oh that no all right I'm seeing a lot
more Detroit's no like oh but you you
already said Detroit is a good first
four hours of oh yeah so we are we just
taking that off the table I think so cuz
I think all right Battletech you're Rob
battle tank or Hyrule warriors yeah cuz
we'll do it first four hours of Detroit
because I'm guessing we kind of already
know what that game is gonna be though
I've never played a David cage game so I
really don't know
Green I already got that we have Thomas
sort of it what are they thinking I
think battle talk is one honestly
Michael tranq it this shitty computer to
open up the straw poll nope it's
processing the straw poll we've been
opening the straw poll for the last like
minute that's kind of ours
results as soon this takes my life I
don't want to do that sure well you have
to vote so obviously you're gonna vote
battle tank no I wants me to verify the
thing that's not popping up on the
stream the are you a human oh wait is
that this laptop someone in chat is just
gonna have to tell us someone we trust
who started the home who started the
straw poll was a beefcake
Oh God Oh God this is the world's worst
laptop
dang it
Just Dance one hit point fuck you
oh did I do it hit it with one hit point
left fuck you game oh it seems like
battle tank is winning by about 60% okay
yeah we can do badly all right I'll play
enough so I'll play it like I've played
strategy games before like I said you're
gonna be doing the bulk of the speaking
and I'll play enough to we we could try
a little Veatch how about we'll we'll do
a review of battle tech will stream
Hyrule warriors first four hours of
Detroit alright boom boom boom alright
easy man easy fucking peasy that's art
that's art we got our three tier
approach I mean we can also do jack game
versus rich game I like giving you their
each episode alright like giving up
saying some sad Vega it's a it's a
Windows 10 laptop it's the Lenovo yoga I
believe it's an older laptop and it
probably just needs a clean install at
this point Jack the exact I I am I'm in
charge of programming here easy it's
it's an easy call Hyrule warriors is
gonna be a good streaming game battle
tech rich will have a lot to say about
because you are super into the strategy
games the Detroit becomes human is a
game that we can probably only stomach
for hours of so we're not reading tips
tonight I'm 90% of this stream has been
me reading tips that's true
90% yeah where have you been I got to
the boss
and then I could literally just read one
after the other non-stop but that would
probably make for a shitty stream yeah
Wow per Austin see says constant prereq
viewers probably can list four to five
games that rich absolutely loves yeah
but Jack I'm having trouble thinking of
some of yours
besides Isaac what are some of your
absolute favorites not just ones you
generally enjoy like Pokemon early
pokemons would be amongst my absolute
favorite by the way okay early pokemons
Game Boy Game Boy Advance pokemons those
were those were my favorite the earliest
would be Game Boy oh come on
right and I'm saying the Game Boy
Advance ones okay it was still early
Pokemon would be would app would be
absolutely one of my favorite games so
yeah Isaac you know spelunky is an
absolute favorite hands down no doubt
breath of the wild would be up there FTL
I like it too okay that's fine I don't
know like maybe I like FTL up but maybe
so but not necessarily 100% my gym um
something I talk about a lot I think I
screamed it once ages ago Metroid Prime
is a game that I love super fucking hard
blood-borne is a game that I love beyond
recognition
try to think of just like my go to get
rocket League rocket every once in a
while still to this day like I haven't
Anna ages like oh it's something it's
like oh I get you know I got 20 minutes
I bet I could get in a match or two like
I didn't feel so good feels so good
that's rocket League is like comfort
food it's just I want one match every
once in a while over well overwatch is
I haven't played overwatch in a fairly
long time I'll be honest with you and
like it's it's to the point now where
there's so many gameplay changes in
overwatch like I might take a longer
break I haven't had an opportunity to
play in like months okay the older games
Jack I like a lot of Jack childhood
games
now that's rough because I have a really
poor memory yeah I really do like
legitimately I don't remember much Super
Mario World absolutely without a doubt
what all-time favorite Super Mario make
a man I was never super into no no I was
more Super Mario World
I was never crazy into Megaman Megaman X
that wasn't old old-school games I love
you know what I loved on what was it on
the n64 and the game q''-word the Paper
Mario games I loved those games there I
mean there's just so you're what you're
asking such a big question is like you
know your all-time bedrock games and
there's just too many of them even named
a bunch so I think that's I think it's
okay some finance great you know what
someone someone asked me on Twitter
earlier Wow you know it's probably a
bedrock game of mine huh is Guitar Hero
for the PlayStation 2 not my gym I know
it's not your jam there was a point in
which anyone who ever came over to my
house was playing guitar hero because
that's all that was happening was we
were playing guitar hero that was one of
those situations where like I was kind
of hesitant on the idea of like oh this
big guitar controlling what you just
played the guitar and then I went to
Best Buy and they had the display and
you played it you're like I fuckin am a
rock star I fell in love with it so hard
Guitar Hero absolute Jam I learned a lot
it ironed a lot of gems that time what's
this shit okay prosthetics Pro Austin C
says last but not least I should have
been using this money in pizza rolls
what is your favorite console and what
console do you probably have the most
hours on during your lifetime my
favorite is probably SNES but I have
most time on ps4 like 2500 hours PC uh
yeah probably piece I'm not trying to be
an asshole but I mean I'm a PC guy I
have been for ever a day yeah you even
with all my console time I probably have
more hours on the PC really probably
mostly because of Team Fortress 2 and
overwatch I mean you know once you start
hitting that thousand our market games
it's like all right yeah definitely for
console oh god how do you even quantify
this I'm an old man right maybe my
GameCube piece - maybe ps2 ps2 financer
you got grand theft auto's yeah ton of
other shit that was my first dynasty
warrior Maximo games heavily underrated
both on the ps2 it was like dynasty
Warriors 3 on the ps2 I think that was
first or one of the dynasty warrior
games on the ps2 good a good guitar hero
Katamari Damacy Shadow of the Colossus
yeah maybe ps2 you might be right
console guys guys I always wanted no PC
answer I don't know why I don't want PC
isn't legit man
I'm gonna try what's new here we got a
lightning thing it's not an exciting
answer what why not it's the Consul he
has the most time in its it's the gaming
machine he has the most time in by far
yeah that's a fine answer rich I think
that's a fine answer
don't let them to don't let them tell
you otherwise that is a fine answer PCs
have also changed a lot in 20 years
they're saying PC isn't very descriptive
yeah I'm sorry I have a universal
platform that doesn't age out and go
away how awkward I'm sorry I'm still
able to play 25 year old PC games right
now
yeah I don't care about any of these
oh alright well we had where we at rich
what where we at Jarl of craft says rich
in Wayne's world at Rob Lowe's apartment
Wayne says in many ways T and G is
superior to but will never be recognized
as the original 25 plus years later do
you agree with that statement I can't
well is is teen G as recognizable to the
general public as the original series e
to the general public probably not
probably at this point you think so
Joe Schmoe who doesn't care about Star
Trek jinkies gonna know who William
Riker is or who dr. McCoy is I think Joe
Schmoe is now a younger demographic so I
would say that they probably know they
probably know a life spine huh Chris
Pine well they probably know like oh
yeah I know that bald guy from the meme
that's not the same thing you're
probably right about that they know the
bald guy from yes you're right about
that and so that's the Star Trek they
would know right when they rebooted the
Star Trek for the movies they used Kirk
not Picard that's true so you're saying
it will it hasn't overtaken the
popularity of the original yeah yeah I
don't know it was it was on longer you
know it was on longer I think more
people saw it
shit but when you say Star Trek to
somebody who's not a Star Trek fan what
do they save them the name Star Trek
what do they think of that's a good you
know what that it that needs that needs
a man on the street yeah that needs a
that means the camera go like I I'm
gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna say a word
you give me the first thing that comes
to mind Star Trek FRA Spock if you so
probably to me it's it's Picard like
when it when I for you yes yeah for you
and for me like what when I say
Enterprise I think of next gen I still
think of the the friggin refit at a
price
oh really oh yeah okay well that that is
the most beautiful ship in all of
science fiction the enter of the refit
Enterprise slash Enterprise a yeah
hands-down the most beautiful ship in
all of science fiction but
Star Destroyer is the most beautiful
chat chat Chad go home you're drunk Chad
the home you're drunk the triangle is a
lumpy triangle that there are way sexier
shit fucking the Millennium Falcon is
sexier than the Star Destroyer give me a
fucking x-wing the x-wing is sexier than
the Star Destroyer come on Chad
there are sexier ships within Star Wars
moving on
no okay sure stolen pvp pvp says you
guys are amazing I've got no question
thank you great it's a mad mad mad mad
max says nice long time lurker first
time tipper slash sub the Amazon black
hole has finally pulled me past the
event horizon thank you for all the
years of entertainment you're welcome

guess I don't know I don't know man I
know you can you get subscribe but the
Amazon Prime but now I just sound like
you showing that it's okay to chill it's
okay to show you don't you don't want to
over a shil
I'm not you know you gotta it's a
balancing act forever rich but when you
do shield you have to open my shoulder
absolutely and I don't think I I don't
think I'd hide it
Renault D 1597 says hey rich and Jack
just wanted to say I sent you guys
something very special to your P o box
it's supposed to arrive tomorrow you
might need to go to the counter to pick
it up I don't think it'll fit in the
mailbox Oh No yeah you know you wouldn't
be the first
honestly we get said some weird shit man
every once in a while someone did say
they were sending us something very nice
someone someone emailed and said and
said hey I'm big fan of your show and I
make custom video game still shadow
boxes okay like little pieces of art
that are from video games yeah would you
like any and I said well sure that looks
oh they look great
he's got a little Etsy store yeah and I
was like I want that one alone it's like
okay I'll send him so that's might be
what he said
okay okay cuz they look cool I think I'd
be like nice on the wall I was waiting
for him to charge you by the way I was
waiting for the charge me too they
specifically said the email like oh I
want I want to send you so I was gonna
be like oh I want this one this way all
right that'll be $42 right I was waiting
for that too but nope just someone who
makes something wants to share
what did I think of the discovery
redesign of the original tos Enterprise
I need to get a better look at it
I know I know definitely in the lighting
they were showing it in it looked kind
of bad but that could have just been the
ugly blue lighting always have to
account for blue for ugly lighting it
looks like they might have added too
many fucking windows to it but I really
need to just get a really honestly good
look at it
gosh dang it gobbledygook says either if
you see the trailer for Eid slash
Bethesda's rage - what's your experience
with rage one from 2011 Bethesda
jokingly said with us and it yes it's a
and if that's one long a or like the two
triple a's together it's a title one of
their vehicular combat games do you like
how was Mad Max lot into one question
you know what I saw here's what I saw I
saw the internet collectively shitting
their pants over over this rage to thing
like shit in a good way like oh my god
I'm so excited about rage - I had never
even heard of Rage I heard of Rage one
absolutely nobody was excited about it
really including me yeah I don't I don't
know what rage one is I don't like Mad
Max but it's not Mad Max okay then it's
the first person and you walk around and
shoot things you also drive around crash
into things
oh that's fun mm-hmm is it I'm what was
it on Oh probably everything everything
ps3 xbox probably the usual okay I I had
no recollection of Rage one so but I saw
a lot of people were really excited
about rage - it was it was an indie game
that absolutely nobody was excited about
when it came out okay
which is weird to me just because it it
yeah legend legendary it'd though at
that point in wasn't quite in the same
it anymore oh okay I'm with you I'm with
you
everyone's going crazy over age - but I
don't know anyone that even likes Rage
well that's what I'm saying like I I
didn't know rage 1 was the thing that
existed and then I'll stand there like
it's happening yeah it's happening you
know what's happening and I like the Mad
Max game but if I'm being perfectly
fucking honest if you if you take the
license out of it I'm not sure I I'm not
sure I give that much of a fuck about it
if I'm being you know just totally
honest you are yeah I'm asking you to be
what like that ice spear like that ice
spear people
at Oquendo wants to know how deep we've
gone to blood-borne chalice dungeons
would you stream them I don't might
stream them at some point I don't think
I've gotten that deep yeah like I don't
think I've gotten more than I don't
think I've gotten more than halfway
through them yeah probably not
i-i've gotten relatively deep I I guess
I don't know what the average is I I
felt like I spent a lot of time in them
yeah and also that they didn't do
anything great for me it fine needs
things yeah I didn't I didn't understand
the purpose of the channel with chalice
dungeons well you find the really nice
things when you get really deep is the
thing oh sure so I just deep in I don't
get even of you I know enough about it
to know there are good rewards sure
eventually you start getting some mighty
powerful gems okay
blood gems and different versions of
like the normal weapons that have
different shapes lots that you can put
different types of gems in there's
rewards sure sure
yeah I I so I guess I didn't get far
enough to understand why they were a
good thing if that gives you any idea of
how far I got into them come find blood
shot says hey guys have you watched
Cobra Kai yep it was better than it
deserves to be i binge the whole season
in one sitting
awesome rich have you ever played
bullets a bullet storm I picked up the
remastered version and fell in love with
it I have not played bullet storm I
think I've heard good things about both
of them right that's it's supposed to be
like a crazy almost like a Dishonored no
combat I think all right I think and
unless the chat is about to prove me
wrong I have watched all of Cobra Kai
and I like it quite a bit we talked
about it earlier and a whole whole
discussion about polar guy whole thing
the whole thing
bad gamer Korean says Jack if your
family eventually find themselves liking
D&D; would you give 40k a try sometime in
the future nope
there's something about non-digital
games that make them great if fridge
still has the mini for Kay's I sent him
years ago
show them to your kids ah you know I
just don't know I've got them somewhere
is that why is it here um I don't know
you know like someone I was I was kind
of sharing my my D&D; with with with
Twitter and people like walking and why
are you in D&D; there's you know there's
these other tabletop RPGs that are so
much better and it's just like you know
what I got to start somewhere man yeah
and maybe I'll fall in love with the MV
and want to branch out more into the
tabletop role-playing arena or maybe
it'll fizzle out oh man maybe subject
maybe say exactly I'm taking I'm taking
it easy here
I think a shop is over here yes and a
potion yes thank you
Tabitha Kirk says that attend dose which
each shop currently has bad dudes on
sale from $7.99 unless to march down
from wait I'm getting hats that are
covering up Chad dude bad dudes like a
double dragons game oh okay
bad do you maybe two bucks
I think they charge too much for
something shop thirty-year-old games
where do we go now I got cut off okay
Bob Hurley has bad dudes on sale from
$7.99 down to 719 ooh
download it now and see why Steve Martin
said in the movie Parenthood they're bad
dudes that's why they call the game bad
dudes I think I'm good yeah III think
that's a bit much bad dudes for me
oh gosh dang it
kappa molo says jack what did you think
of the story - horizon zero dawn i
actually found it very good and gave a
shit which is rare since most video game
stories are bad
I'd ask richest opinion but I don't
think he ever finished it I absolutely
loved the game
once again I did look up spoilers I
thought it was fine yeah I enjoyed it
actually you know what I didn't finish
the game when we did the review yeah I
couldn't get that far like you know it's
a big game but that is one that I after
the review I absolutely went back finish
the story did all the side missions I
wanted to do and really enjoyed it I
thought it was I mean it was fairly
predictable yeah relatively speaking but
I enjoyed the story overall of horizon
zero dawn and that's good I liked yeah I
mean you guys know that I like - horizon
zero dawn but I felt really satisfied at
the ending you know you get that that
cutscene at the end that's something you
talk about a lot of like the earned
cutscene like hey I beat the game give
me give me a little moving right and I
don't really feel that very often in
games but but here was a point where I
did I didn't want to play this like I
was done yeah
just show me the end ah okay that was
that was one of those rare times and I I
just wanted to sit back and enjoy the
ending so
soul tornado says what are your thoughts
and Kevin Sorbo and Hercules The
Legendary Journeys could something
similar be done today well if you want
just something that's a schlocky action
show couldn't you count ash vs. Evil
Dead that was done today there's their
schlocky action shows alright like like
heck that's half of the CW lineup right
now is schlocky action shows I just have
Super Heroes nobody's agreeing with me I
see three noes so I don't think they
agree with me on that
ash vs. Evil Dead being a social action
show yeah maybe y'all don't know what
schlock is
I don't know that anybody likes Kevin
Sorbo though I know I we just talking
about this like a streamer or two ago I
have really fond memories of watching
both Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess
I'm pretty sure Kevin Sorbo is a huge
dickhead now yeah that doesn't sour me
on how much I loved her cousin Xena was
fair but I also still think these shows
exists 100% shocky action shows what
what's currently on today that you would
compared to Hercules The Legendary
Journeys that's on today that's on today
that's not currently right now so you
can't even say ash vs. Evil Dead because
they just cancel no it's true
would we count something like flash like
like you know a little bit of action a
little bit of superhero stuff but mostly
isn't hokey enough is it hokey and it's
fairly hokey okay I know why I'm asking
you guys I've not watched the flash I'm
not if you say it is I have to take your
word for it I have not watched the flesh
as hokey as Hercules probably not
because that was super tongue-in-cheek
but I think if you look at stuff like
flash and Supergirl who don't take
themselves very seriously yeah you'd
have kinesin contenders decent
contenders yeah or legends of tomorrow
any of those CW schlock shows you
probably have decent contenders
right up
what do we think of the ash vs. Evil
Dead ending I haven't seen season 3 AB I
was waiting to binge it and based on
what you're saying I'm guessing it's
finally all been aired so it's something
that some a I gotta get around to it
Thanks nice got some coin I got some
coin what do you got serves
what are you what did you do did you
hurt me how what did you do you did hurt
me but you had a chance to poison foes a
poopoo pee-pee dad said hey which
perfect
speaking of enterprises have you ever
checked out Andrew perverts enterprise-c
concept renderings he designed a concept
enterprise-c for the show but it wasn't
used
he has since had a full CG model made
Probert is the designer of the refit and
the D by the way yeah I know that much
about him I heard he had a design for
the C I think I saw it ages ago but I
don't really remember what it looked
like so III can't give you the kind of
feedback you like or want on that I
don't know how you pronounce his name I
pronounce it Probert PR OB ERT robot
that's the boss ooh he's laughing at you
laughing no he earned it
I feel like I'm doing better I'm now
getting to that first boss more this is
a roguelike yeah okay yeah it's wrong
like you you unlock different spells
that you can use in combination of each
other and different map layouts every
time so I feel like I'm getting there
that oh that boss is fog and tough
though that was that might have been
just a little too tough for me we need a
flurry let's see what you are and fire I
don't want any firewall I go blast sure
I feel like I need water I need water
spells because I'm in a fire level you
know I don't know if that works I'm
facing a fire boss do you think water
will have an advantage over the fire
boss I probably would typically it would
but I don't know if that's one of these
games or if this is just the fire boss
you know can anyone recommend a game
that makes you feel like a badass
similar to doom I really there's
anything that makes you feel quite as
badass as doom does that's that's the
epitome of feeling like a bath s dooms
kind of a spit like you know cuz you can
look at games like God of War which has
a very good combat system and does make
you feel like a badass you've got a war
I love the combin love the combat system
remember everyone I love it
you have games for me like dynasty
warriors which though they're hack and
slash II you are the big strong person
and you mow down everyone but doom doom
has that sadist like that difficulty
balance just down and and how many games
do the bad guys write a Bible about how
terrified you make them
right what are the enemies so afraid of
you that they make a religion out of it
like they're so afraid of you like do I
make you feel like a badass not only in
the gameplay but also just in the war
they they carve tales about you in stone
to make sure no one forgets that you
will wreck them yeah yeah I agree you
know I'm seeing like blood-borne and
Metroid Prime and that's you know
blood-borne it can be very satisfying
when you win but it's all both of those
games I could have very similar tones
which is just it's all about kind of
despair and loneliness and exploration
like those games do not make you feel
like a badass they make you feel sad
doom doom was like a horror game where
you are the monster yeah do what I like
about doom is it flips the script mm-hmm
doom you're alone on a base on Mars
everyone else is dead and the base is
filled with demons like the script there
it's very obvious you know where you
were fucked you are absolutely fucked
but but doom let you turn the tables
it's not fuck that they're trapped in
here with me the demon should be afraid
of me oh and they are sure all the
fucking demons it's very it's very
pleasant you know it is
just I I just agreed it's like aliens of
all the aliens were running away from
Ripley maybe a less exciting movie but
well it'd be like an alien game where
you play as the alien and you are you
are the monster you hunt and stalk the
humans it kind of like when you play
Friday the 13th and you're Jason is like
oh I'm in charge here I'm the boss and
it's bedtime yeah yeah with you so
there's there's other games where you
kick ass but it's not the same it's not
the same
like that spear I like that ice spear
we're gonna go a little more ice heavy
with my build this time ice and
lightning and we're gonna see if we can
do oh but now I get the tree guy first
oh well ice ice should be powerful
against tree dudes baby lightning too
this time let's see if that does me any
good
yeah that's pretty good I'm getting it
I'm understanding
yes you feel like a badass in the Arkham
games just not to the great degree you
feel like a badass play Doom I don't
know yeah and I don't know like if
you're supposed to ever feel like a
badass as Batman you're you know you're
kind of Batman is above being a badass
Batman is all about efficiency right and
sometimes efficiency just means being a
badass right right but he never wants to
like Batman could never say he's a
badass but you can never fee it when
you're put when you are Batman you can
never feel like a badass cuz there's
business to be done yes that smell about
the business I got to do this
you yourself said the Arkham games make
you feel like a badass you frauds look
I'm not saying it doesn't make I'm
saying it's not comparable to how much
of a badass you feel like when you
played doom you're so much of a badass I
feel like when I'm playing Batman here's
how much of a badass I feel like when
I'm playing doom here's how much of a
badass I feel like when I'm playing
stardew valley it's somewhere down there
with Tetris and Mario right stardew
valley get out of town it's great that's
great Jimmy I would never say he's a
badass either he does it with his hands
oh yeah first of all yes no I'm not
talking about physically saying you're
badass I'm talking about your feeling
when you're playing yes when you are
when you are the doom Slayer I am sure
that the doom Slayer is smiling while
ripping demons I think that the doom
Slayer gets a certain amount of joy out
of ripping our demons har down and I
just don't think Batman like what when
I'm Batman I'm cold and I'm calculated
I'm doing so there so there's different
there's just different feelings you know
gosh dang it
I was having like up until a room ago I
was having a really good run and and now
I'm not I'm sorry that's the end of my
story it's a good story
fuck why
dang it dang it dang it dang it

with what sharp things it's all I know
yeah I know a creepy old guy I know even
less rich sometimes oh sorry light
