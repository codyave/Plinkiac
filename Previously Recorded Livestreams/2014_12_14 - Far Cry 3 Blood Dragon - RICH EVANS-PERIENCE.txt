alright I'm back I'm back yeah here's
here's the deal Jedi Knight to uh it
starts off pretty slow
so I mean if I ever stream that I might
start it sometime after the first few
levels I don't want to bother playing
through to get there and as far as XCOM
goes we all know I love x come I I adore
XCOM i'm just i'm not particularly in
the mood right this second I don't know
however I do have an itching to play
more of blood dragon did stream and
perform I was kind of bad at it but
first time I played the game I was
playing around like a new key set up new
layout new configuration on the keyboard
I didn't like it I normally who's the
number pad I was not using the number
pad so I'm going to give I'm going to
give a blood dragon stream one more shot
one more shot
and then I'll play that for a bit and
then maybe I'll change my mind and play
something different after a while I
don't know here we go I'm gonna play a
little bit of blood dragon and if you
think it's sex fuck you all right
probably help if I told broadcaster that
was the game I was playing now
see if I let me see if I say I'm not
logged in as previously record I can't
change the title ah you know what screw
it if Jack's listening he can change
that if not a big deal big deal all
right
alrighty you guys seeing the game yep
there it is alright
and you know I compulsively cannot skip
cutscenes right so we're gonna watch
this shit again it's like a compulsion I
can't make myself skip a cutscene that I
don't I don't know i'm weird space earth

to the deliberately bad tutorial if you
wish to jump I'll tell you what chap
because I played this before to make
this interesting I'm gonna play until I
die how's that just let me kill people
this would be this will be a no death
run now I have no illusions that I'm
gonna make through the game without
dying but we're gonna play this as a no
death run how's that sound and as far as
me not talking I'm here alone i'm not
i'm not good at filling time on my own
i'm streaming cuz i'm a nice guy Jack
couldn't make it but streaming night so
I'm just here alone that's it's gonna be
a bit boring that's what happens that's
what happens when I'm by myself
perform a blade take down when sneaking
up to an enemy tag enemies to track them
more easily we'll see we'll see how
short that's no death right in this chat
you're so you're so confident we'll see
we'll see I'm gonna kill all their asses
enemies with your DD nerd it's gonna be
a super death run it's just not gonna be
my death spider these guys are made of
force I got your back bro
after a blade takedown you can change
hill nearby enemies so many men so
little time
this takes me back time to get higher
seriously loading more training hints
from the ABCs of war

terrible see how far and yet this is
where it really starts in them after
performing a blade takedown you can sure
oh shit I fucked up already alright
alright that could have been worse

served under YouTube spider no way he
went rogue not him way to put a bullet
in the big man let's just get to the
main frame and figure out what the hell
