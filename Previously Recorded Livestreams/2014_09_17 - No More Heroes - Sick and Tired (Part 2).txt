pretty tired that's saved steel four
five six is Jack do you like half-life
two it has no cutscenes I do like
half-life 2 half-life 2 is a good
example of all the story taking place
while you're playing the game you
understand what's happening in the world
your role in it without ever leaving
your character while always playing I
think we've talked about this on the
stream before metroid prime is also
another example a really good example of
storytelling through gameplay you know
you have this scanning mechanic where
you scan enemies and you scan objects
around you and sometimes it will give
you clues on how to defeat an enemy and
sometimes it will tell you back story
but because scanning is integrated into
the mechanics of the game it is both
gameplay and story they can handles it
very well dig the birthday boy says I
don't like Jack anymore well welcome to
the club ah is Jack a hipster no you
have to be cool to be a hipster
just like a cutscene but not a concern
how does the chat feel about cutscenes
the chat is really pissed at me yeah
yeah really pissed at me um mostly
because because I'm I i guess i need to
reiterate myself where you know
cutscenes happen and i'm okay with them
happening now but in a perfect world we
would just started liking Jack listen
that gives harsh opinions up lots a lot
of good well i'll tell more fart jokes
later you guys will get back into i'm
making a broad statement that doesn't
apply to everything i'm making a general
statement i'm trying to think of a game
where like the cutscenes have been fun
like you know we owe you know what like
we play mark of the ninja well mark of
the ninja is a great game and it has
these wonderful little animated
cutscenes now personally I think they're
unnecessary because i don't like cut
sins but I appreciate and I think they
look cool and you know it's a it's a fun
way to tell the story this you know the
cutscenes are fine I again he's lying
personally I don't like them because i
don't like cutscenes but it's fine
I don't think you even gave it a chance
check i gave it not even given a chance
you know what killed it it was the
tutorial that that killed could have
skipped that any decide at any time it
kept as you do you want to keep going to
the tutorial which list with this dude
up said no oh sure no but it's too and
you could have said no and you would
have been able to learn by making errors
yeah that's true nice true I think you
told me to do it yeah you told me that
trouble to do that tutorial oh yeah yeah
so you gonna stop sobbing you could have
stopped youtube lend me a button the
Metal Gear Solid series is well known
for its cutscenes that's right it's also
well known for bang convoluted nonsense
yeah that's that's a different argument
I think I think the Metal Gear Solid
series is a perfect is a perfect
escalation of the end game of my
argument against cutscenes in fact that
in particular is probably a series that
would be better without a story you know
what was it did someone that I think
someone made a video where they started
a timer with metal gear solid four and
it took them 23 minutes to start playing
with you yeah that it harm i don't know
i might assume that of yourself you know
where i didn't say much my son expert i
don't know i think that's that's a great
example of a cut cut scenes going too
far
it's never Jack's fault he is perfect
and his opinions infallible that's right
that's right from Metal Gear Solid 2
cutscenes our apush modern masterpiece
oh what happened oh whoa accidentally
hit the hole
oh you sent fuck back didn't understand
it I met her ba ba ba baby she told me
they got 70 Jesse got around the orders
until the days it might not have stopped
Jesse didn't go to the phone Jesse
didn't go to the post office today
someone i can only assume gripper type
that someone sent us someone 3d printed
a natural like talking fuck bought 5,000
Jesse didn't go to the post ops should I
blame Jesse so so it's not here let's
see here Jack what's your opinion on
sticks I see you being a fan I like a
couple of their songs stings come sail
away or mr. robot I'm usually getting it
so more to God I know that song and then
come sail away I never could have told
you who did oh okay I never gonna told
you they're the same people who did
let's go away let's come away whatever
so there there are exactly two songs and
sticks that I can think of off the top
of my head then I enjoy possibly
ironically
let's sit here
Lucas hearts says there is a correct and
incorrect way to include and use
cutscenes Metal Gear Solid is where
Jack's opinion counts but there are many
games where cutscenes are fantastic and
Lucas farts I agree with you just
because just because I think they're
unnecessary doesn't mean that I won't
enjoy a good cut scene it just means i
think in a perfect world they won't
exist that might seem counterintuitive
hey sure my bots might seem
counterintuitive but whatever i don't i
don't think that they shouldn't exist i
gotta find with them I think you can do
cinematic things with a cutscene that
you couldn't do otherwise and so I can't
imagine Grand Theft Auto without
cutscenes oh I don't know I don't know
cuz those those those games take so many
cues for movies too sure she are someone
was saying someone was asking about
quick time events and to me quick time
events are are like someone making a
cutscene trying to shove in gameplay
elements I think you have to go full
full on or nothing quick time events are
Oh looks like that's like a cutscene
that you can't enjoy because you're too
busy paying attention to button presses
life I hate them that's a quick time
event is kind of like a half-assed
cutscene it's a cutscene that you're
physically incapable of your enjoying
because the QuickTime event oh that's
right Darien bro makes a really good
point how I should probably end my
argument is just saying I mean I don't
like cutscenes I'm just saying that's
right switchblades pokemon GTA used to
not have cut scenes and they were fine
well be the original GTA's I'm trying to
leave the 2d one I presume every sensor
is ever since 3d GTA's there been little
mini little pudsey that's every trying
to think whatever you talk to somebody
I'm trying to think of San Andreas
the minimal cutscenes those every time
you had a mission you till you go to
somebody's house to talk to somebody
explain something sure there's there's
witty banter there's using characters
aah boozy woozy tripping over things cuz
he's blind yeah yeah mmmm yeah so what
was the story only doing one more
mission and then you want to play punch
out or something you obviously hate this
and that's fine you can keep playing
that's fine what about hotline Miami's
cutscenes I'll buy mine because I have
cutscenes does it there you know like
you know hotline Miami has yeah the
little part through where you don't
there's nothing really going on but you
go and talk to people you choose to go
and talk to people in this time what you
that to what do that yeah GTA GTA 2 had
no cutscenes the top get out on the top
down one no that's still revolutionary
listen what I felt like my own these
cutscenes I'm trying to think do you
just mean like when we see the little
characters face come on screen for a
second is that a cutscene I know
technically I think that is why can't I
was good it's been it's been a couple
it's been like a month or so since i
played online
dark mustard says I played katamari
based on your streams and skipped every
cutscene absofuckinlutely you can don't
think any doesn't anybody think that the
story that's a little bit of context of
what you're doing makes it more
enjoyable it's not about the story story
is important to gain it's how it's how
they handle telling you it's it's when
they say it's when they say we need to
move you into this other area where we
can tell you the story now go back to
area number one to play your game and
there's a world in which they can exist
in the same room standing goddamn that's
right Lucas farts oh no pac man does
have a cousin oh no that's miss pac-man
the original pac-man what's the
background of 20 there's a few of them
like every five missions or so things
happened that's right those gets caught
she's ripped off that's right so pac-man
has cut scenes
but so no my games needs games need
contact some games need story and I
think there's a way to handle it in
gameplay I don't think that's the only
way you should do it really way you can
know it has to be done yeah and that's
you know what it's fine we've talked
about movie guilty pleasures before any
early Michael Bay the rock bad boys bad
boys too bad 90s John Woo like face off
ha fucking love face off watch face up
every day true built each other and
actually felt like how the better yeah
it's been too long since I've seen our
everybody's already dead I got the fun
power up and there I flows I'm sorry
they're all named after dessert
incidentally I could just yell out
chocolate strawberry sundae really yeah
yeah that's honey
sorry Mario but our princess is in
another castle cutscene it is you're
absolutely right they're absolutely
right Jack did rich see that youtube
animation of your FTL msj right yes I
sure everybody who see it here love yes
I i made sure rich sauce when i came in
today and every everyone here Mike to my
changes he also saw and they think it's
wonderful I think it's wonderful if you
haven't seen it go to youtube and search
previously recorded animated someone
made a really great someone made a
really great little animation of our MVL
run ms pacman does not show up testing
where she goes and kisses video all the
icon
well so someone is mentioned in
half-life 2 and the cutscenes their arse
moments in half-life 2 where say you are
trapped like when you're trapped in the
teleporter or like when you're trapped
in a room with an NPC you have to listen
to them but you're still controlling the
character like you can still like turn
your head a little bit or move around
you never leave your character except
for a little bit at the internal over
there towards the end ugly you're always
in the head of Gorman Gordon Freeman
whether you can move or not is
contextual but I don't think they're
custom Lucas martes says Jack makes a
fair point but takes it too far for
anything for anyone most people to get
on board you're right look dif I'm
you're an extremist I'm an extremist
absolutely you're the ISIS of video
games Oh too far too soon ooh child
bride pong no cutscenes great game space
and finish space invaders no pet see
drinking Frogger ahh bra the classics
nothing with the classics Burger Time
which really needs one I have no idea
what's going on from the time did I say
Gorman Freeman I'm sorry
gonna hit happy with that
mortal kombat fatalities cutscenes ah no
that'd be like a fool love you like
slo-mo camera yeah you're still in game
point uh Jesus Christ this is just a
half deal I'm not saying my feelings are
corrected or any more valid than anybody
in the galaxy whew my opinions are just
as valid as anyone elses which means not
at all oh what's that oh so much
we just explode every murders everybody
all right that's pretty cool the
attention whole lot of those get money
at the end of the mission if you don't
use them but actress pls stream
something hmm let's see here what does
what does everybody think of no more
heroes you guys you guys like this game
do you guys hate this game yeah like
what are your feelings on this it looks
fine i think the personally i helped
like than just the combat that those
were the walk and so it never felt I
never felt satisfying beating people but
now you're you're a crazy man I only
played one level so I that's that's big
caveat
how long another one that almost never
happens the first one I think it's
exponentially more buddy yeah yeah come
on they say they enjoy watching you plan
but yeah it looks like the consensus is
it's like it's either okay or they don't
much care for really yeah look up what
they said to enjoy watching you play oh
wait no there's no we're here is great
this game is rad nice style but Matt
gameplay you know repetitive I could see
that I'm so fucking confused by his key
might maybe you just have to get
absorbed into this game I you know and
I'm gonna go ahead agree with twitch
plays Pokemon this the he says the game
style and characters are appealing but
the gameplay isn't you get a basic yeah
are you fighting a baseball team yep
what's this game is nuts this game is
crazy game is woefully wonderfully nice
haha sure okay I like that I'm fine with
willful wing nuts
a lot i know i'm reading that now a lot
of people are saying great
I i think if y'all are we and you
haven't played this game it's worth
checking out
if you can I mean if there's a ps3
version
I wouldn't say that I'm twitch plays
Pokemon bitch but they do have that
she's kind of service they twitch plays
Pokemon has that little like battery
thing next to his name so his name is
and I assume you're a he I apologize if
I'm being sexist you have that little
battery thing next to your name so it
sticks out in the chat very very very
much so he's very much your bitch though
yeah no I'm his bitch as I said I'm
saying oh yeah from your perspective
yeah i'm with you i was talking to
twitch plays for you mama you're right
you're absolutely right the wiimote is
just a controller playing with the ps3
pad makes no difference except for and
how you hold the fucking controller
if you think about holding the wiimote
and then having to press a precisely I
think the despots are we lot more
awkward with the controller we're gonna
kiss ya my person and making sure i
think i think this game plays great with
the wiimote and just didn't feel like
you know because of the way you have to
keep hitting the button out is it didn't
feel I don't like how I it's not needle
as wagon for everything you do that the
time to do shapely modes like it's like
the punctuation on the end of the sense
I've heard somebody describe it that way
react okay satisfied death blow
okay about God and have you played God
he'll know I haven't fight got in i
don't know nothing about it rich has
equated here we don't know nothing about
no
don bluth the animator so what is asking
me what I think fuck down blue uh yeah
yeah what about about it luisi what did
he make I'm blanket I'm blanking on Dom
balloon hold on I'm gonna look him up he
sure didn't make that dragon's lair oh
he made a lot more than that I know oh
I'm gonna look up all the things down
Black Cauldron titan AE i think was him
oh yeah and why say it was tumbling
humble bumble I'm not looking at the
chat for a second I'm just gonna look up
all the stuff you did secret of NIMH an
American tail when more time anastasiya
dragon's lair yeah the garden of madness
I think that the secret of NIMH is a
beautiful movie to look at but narrative
Lee it makes very little sense it's a
bit of a mess as far as a children I I
haven't seen it in a very long time but
i remember liking a lot it looks great i
right now isn't it may is the secret of
NIMH the one word like the farmer is
about to mow the field and i need to
move there yes
and it's been a while since I've seen
that one yeah I'm okay with Don blue
disregard any idea disregard any review
guys reviewers have opinions if a
reviewer doesn't like a thing that you
like that's fine this mean doesn't mean
you don't have to like it anymore that's
the thing you can have your own feelings
and opinions on things and that's fine
it's a weird thing to say I know let's
enjoy this oh this is the boss man yeah
okay oh yeah we're gonna get a cutscene
is that what you're saying yeah okay
Jack what would you regard as a very
funny movie there are a lot
just because I'm we were thinking about
it recently i will say wet hot american
summer this is very funny
would you say Ghostbusters ism yep he's
singing I love it ghostbusters yeah very
funny or just not a very funny movie but
just an extremely well-put-together
great movie ghostbusters is an extremely
well-put-together great movie that has
some funny aspects i would not come on
man i don't have like gut-busting laughs
during ghostbusters right and one of the
most enjoyable movies over absolutely
something like airplane is a very funny
movie yeah something like I'm her to see
me and my injury like boyhood that's a
very funny let's skip the cutscene no
brick riches in control he can choose
whether he skips or not cariño who got
John kilo wants me to recommend God hand
to you I should try to do good course
fuck my entry fee so yeah there there
are a lot of very funny movies what
you're trying to think of any that are
funnier than one hot american summer
it's hard to think of one what an
American summer is a genius lee funny
early reservations only wow those
outside Spaceballs enjoys baseball today
sir what AM L Brooks lot a lot of road
now Brookside like I don't know that's
not a good you know what there's a lot
of very funny movies how about that
something that I wouldn't consider a
very funny movie but I think I laughed
the most that is dirty rotten scoundrels
yeah Steve Martin who's this young given
week yeah old man he was a yeah I know
what is I here's the butler and the
Batman movies god damn it bburago look
at this fucking name me too what is this
him oh my God he's elfrid in the new
Batman that's not all he's been comes
like the least of the fancy saying God
he's been in movies recently what is
this okay Michael came thank you Michael
can't see my pretty rotten scoundrels
there is a series in that movie in which
Steve Martin plays his brother reprint
yeah I think he's got the cork out us
for bed how many gems okay I oh man but
i don't think i've left harder as
sequence in mind that that's great
Michael Caine I can't believe what we
forgot about my cocaine my cocaine
that's right it was just one of those
think your brain goes down yeah the old
are you sometimes take longer than you'd
like to remember simple coven things
right terrible isn't it terrible get
home I guess so another thing we were
talking about earlier like Wayne's World
Wayne's World I don't know if I would
call it a very funny movie it's just a
very good movie with some funny parts to
it Mike okay
Jack how long has it been since I last
did cocaine about 32 years cuz that's
how old I am I've never done coke and
I'm gonna say I'm fairly proud of that
no offense to any cocaine users but I
don't think it would be my thing um I
the boss madhava had a while ago was
that a used video game and movie store
and it was awesome it was the greatest
time of my life and my boss was a
wannabe mobster and he would talk about
drugs all the time and the one bird he
kept talking about was cocaine and he
always said that he would never ever do
cocaine I was like well that's a normal
thing to say never mind to do hard drugs
he's like no no no I would never do
cocaine because i think i would love it
he's like I could see myself taking
cocaine and becoming an addict he
immediately cocaine to my fence yeah
yeah cocaine's got a long ways I don't
know that I personally ask but
let's see here someone is saying stop
hitting Daniel day-lewis with your
fluorescent light bulb and I think
that's funny they they're going for
Michelle grunts OH Johnson is totally
bronze that's definitely Bronson and you
know what it does look a lot like
fluorescent label it does you can
probably make one out of a fluorescent
light bulb and be a great costume that
would be down I'm sure there's some
traffic touchdown cosplay out there with
the fluorescent light bulbs Trump
unmodified fluorescent light bulb
oh thank you are mt4 asked Jack do you
guys need any more new key tapes
absolutely I think we need that my J's
laheera please please stop sending this
new key takes number only need to come
up no more we need a couple more new
DJ's three or four more new potatoes we
can find them go to your local thrift
store go to your local swaddly we need a
couple more new key tapes before we're
ready for our master new key point send
them to the VL box it'll be great
he looks like Geraldo sure I mean
mustache you know
possibly ironic 69 says rich does not
advocate cocaine but he advocates
fluorescent light bulb abuse yes yes yes
I know that I did it all for the new key
that was a funny joke that Mike said
rapidly Jennifer it's open mic night II
mean yes we need 57 more new key tapes
to finish the new key fort oh no that
wasn't rich snorting anything that was
him blowing his nose I have a terrible
cold right now a terrible horrible oh
yeah great all the Travis touched a
touchdown cosplay armed with white bulbs
that's great pond people i don't know
what that is Wow I'm trying to reach oh
yeah there's nothing here
let's see here steel four five six asked
Jack who is the best comedian comedian
in rlm ah what's your spec obviously
it's the wheel yeah the wheel has a
really sick sense of humor so it is the
best comedian the beginning call me when
the next one's arranged ah jack is Jesse
on the panel of any of the upcoming best
of the worst maybe possibly the next one
maybe she's very good what she's not a
pedal I think so I like I mean I think
as everyone knows I like Jesse in
general but but I like it when she's on
the fan
I need to refill my napkins um someone
asks have big soup have you or are you
going to see the Angry Video Game Nerd
movie so the question is I have seen the
Angry Video Game Nerd movie and Jay and
I have some strong feelings about the
Angry Video Game Nerd movie so the
question is do I talk about them now
he's you Wendell Jays around I should
wait till jasor wait bill taser up I
think because I won't be able to have a
back and forth the I hesitated so
exactly i j and i have seen the Angry
Video Game Nerd movie we have some
strong feelings on it and the next time
we are together in a stream we will talk
about them but not right now rich is
sick I think we're gonna take a little
yeah break I think we are so we'll come
back maybe we'll pop on no more heroes
two mmm maybe punch out maybe another
game here to pledge how we got another
game play another game so we're gonna
take a little break a break they will
take a vote will let everybody know what
games we have and then we'll take a vote
and then we'll ignore the vote that's
where you do we get back we're gonna
list all again we can play and then
we're gonna take a vote we're gonna take
a vote and then we're gonna completely
ignore this and play whatever the fuck
yes I think it's a great idea all right
guys won't well we're back in a second
