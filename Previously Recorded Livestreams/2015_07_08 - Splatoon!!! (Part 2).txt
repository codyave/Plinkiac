and what's happening here shy shy I'm
joining up with you you're the first
person on the way all right okay rich
take over that Chet never tried to join
a battle apparently because uh what
about Wilkinson I join your battle all
the music reminds me of like music I
listen to when I got high
it's all very like low low class reggae
you know yeah I bet some I've got some
people get high other place books here I
believe that I joined friends that'll
never work so I'm not doing it that's
just a thing and now we can't
communicate
but the boys ship the block now oh here
we go here we go we're here Luigi Raven
cone our amber Japanese letters a star
man Jack and Japanese letters ready for
the battle turf war the most turf to win
these games at roller derby skate park
we have code our amber or I can read the
rest
Japanese many men and give me the rest
of less long enough and they're starting
off painting their home territory which
seems to be the go-to strategy happens
all the time
jack is making away along the left side
painting his ground no enemies in sight
yet can't wait for the real action to
break out and he's he's stealthily
making his way towards the blue areas
some are that I can't I can't keep that
shit up I can't do it plus it's
derivative and I'm better than that god
damn it oh jesus fucking christ what
even got you I have no idea you can blow
up things too close to that woman pretty
much all right all right we're going
fartole we're going for it go
nice got him that fucker was just waving
around his paint rollers paint like
nowhere near you right just like fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Oh blue ink
no oh I ran out of ink I ran out of ink
Luigi you fuck you got me I'm getting
better at grenades grades I think
helping in territory control here shit
don't you dick it
get the fuck out of our home base bluey
I've really have to watch my ink ink
reserve yeah there's gonna fuck me money
too Oh oh my god what was that a
landmine of being ink mine on it what
I'm yes yes rich thank you thank you
rich thank you rich no no rich is here
rich is here to help fuck man that's so
raven Oh didn't stand a chance
mail Amick dies a lot just died again
hiding hiding
ah he's got a helmet that Luigi's got a
fucking helmet I don't think I don't
think it makes any difference probably
not it just keeps them fresh funky fresh
it's all about being fresh in this game
rich fuck come on look at all those
fucking blue in our territory
start covering that ground now throw a
grenade Oh grenade didn't go off I don't
think we got it oh it's gonna be close
this is gonna be close
I don't think we got it though no you
don't that's close
42 I'll take 40 - I'll take 42 that was
a valiant effort you did well jack
I felt like I did what our last place I
felt like I was contributing to my team
god damn it that's all you can ask for
is is that you contributed something to
your team battle again fuck yeah let's
do it I'm gonna splatoon the shit out of
you guys who do we got here Luigi Raven
amberjack Brian mr. shy guy Japanese
letters and Verne Vin Diesel yep avid
gamer Vin Diesel which is very true by
the way Richie forgive me mauled to
death by an animal an what animal would
it be that's a good question
that's a really good question probably
like a rabbit cuz you know people would
just keep talking about that forever do
you about that guy who got mauled to
death by a rabbit what the fuck I'd be
immortal that's true
fuck you has a lot of grenades
what do you arrange do you get I'd have
no idea I know it depletes your ink
resources resources here we go here we
go here we go here we go here we go now
there's some fucker in there what why
are they covered with sunshine good
question I think those were shields I
think they had some sort of shields oh
my god we are getting our asses handed
to us handily they're all up in our home
business here guys
it's surrender an option
no no retreat no surrender
if I had the bank Zuka fuck Brian you
fuck this is exactly why they can never
have a mic on the game just because
everyone will be calling each other
fucks Tendo wouldn't want that this is
that the reasoning then yeah I believe
so yeah
makes it seem work impossible though it
makes teamwork impossible you can you
can't strategize beyond I still want to
know why they're covered in sunlight
that's a shield I've already how do you
get a shield that's like a bonus thing
that you can have for what for how I
don't know yeah yeah get out of here
fuck like my bonus is the inkzooka yeah
and their bonus is the sunshine how do
you die where do you choose a bonus in
your in you choose the thing Shogun Oh
booming Zuka Beach I didn't know about
that I would've been using it that was
the thing that you pressed down Arden oh
my god I never did that once oh well
there you go get get get damn it she's
on point
Japanese letters at some point Japanese
letters at some point they usually are
shit shit we lost I don't know if I've
won a single game like ever I mean in
the stream tonight I think I've lost
every game in this dream tonight
oh you won one that was uh that's a hard
loss right there 38 percent 38 fucking
percent I'm ashamed

team though that's pretty good yeah

covers more area or use the bombs

doing it what they're super special
Seabees get multiple yeah that seems to
be very helpful
yeah it doesn't take down on enemies
that fast I like taking down enemies
let's try a different weapon what's this
what's this fucker about flamethrower Oh
inaccurate but really fast
yeah oh yeah that really covers ground

great all right let's play some more how
long have you been playing for oh my
gourd yep
it's late this might we started like
this yeah this might be all we play
tonight what time do we actually start
Oh game wise yeah definitely does good
but the only game we played it down you
know what I want to get is that I have
you if I talk to you about affordable
space adventure and no you haven't
what does affordable space adventure the
it's a Wii U game that you have to play
like with the gamepad and on the screen
yeah and you have to talk to each other
because one person you fly a spaceship
and one person pilots the spaceship or
like takes care of the engines with the
gamepad yeah and the other person has to
like bomb stuff using the Wiimote and
stuff we do another night with that
we'll do that and and smash yeah it'll
be the first time I've played smash
since I rented the original and didn't
like it that much
I'm excited for you to play okay battle
time here we go I think we officially
started at like 9:30 mm-hmm that's what
I'm gonna say
so if we could make it 11:30 if we got
made till 11:30 I got I got a doctor's
appointment tomorrow so I want to be up
too late okay 11:30
splatoon boom
oh yeah this covers a lot of areas but I
guess it does yes yes this
oh I see you where are you where are ya
grenade oh shit
oh that wouldn't hurt me that what high
ground high ground oh they got the high
ground they know they know what's up all
these people who know how to play the
game fuck can you destroy those yes yes
you can
okay okay Jack your bombs charged
and I got I got two out
I don't know those bombs are actually
the greatest thing ever Jack I don't
know hi Kyle you know it could be I
might have to actually learn how to use
them and that terrifies me forget you oh
I got you
boom in your face and your stew well you
know what I took care there they had to
control the high ground I sacrificed
myself I think if I could get to the
high ground with my bomb rush that would
be pretty sick right yeah oh I knew you
were hiding back there oh well okay I
killed you
I saw you can can't can't can't I'm on
to you can't to get one up on you oh I
see I see someone's over here someone's
over here the trying to be sneaky nope
trying to be super sneaky I got you Luna
I got your back I got your back Luna
star
okay I'm covering covering ground this
is what I would say like if we could
talk to each other over ground but you
can certainly can't use a grenade oh yes
your magic ones are charged up I'm going
I'm trying to get up okay come on come
on get up
get out of there oh I had the bomb rush
and you didn't use it because I had my
plan rich you plan filled their night
everybody was up on the high ground my
plan you should have thrown the bombs up
on the high ground oh my god it's all
right
oh my god that would have made way too
much sense rich 31 percent that's my
work show not the worst of my team knows
I'll take that you over my team all
right
we're trying again we are gonna dominate
one of these rounds who apparently
leveled up with quantity over quality
but I guess again even losing in here
and something right oh we got our friend
Brian we got mr. shy guy and Mel's women
they are Mel's I don't know if you're
with us in Chad Mills but welcome and if
you're not welcome anyway hopefully
you're just while playing you gotta get
a warm feeling that someone someone in
Vaes is welcoming of you I have some
open spots here if I have friends who
want to Sean K Japanese letters Japanese
letters and Japanese waters I don't know
if those are Japanese letters they're
just squiggles to me I don't care I
guess our little letters are just
squiggles to the button technically they
might not even be letters and character
glyph there's something sure whatever
you leave that to the paintbrush yeah I
took the opposite direction okay okay
I'm using clues I saw the paintbrush
working one angle I'm working I wasn't
started working the other angle it'd be
great if we could have a game plan you
know beforehand button but hey oh my god
you're just deep into it what you're
just deep in the blue here that's fine
that's fine I got a fine shit I see you
I see you okay oh I had my bomb rise too
it's fine I'll get it back I'll get it
back you know we got all this uncovered
territory over here guys sloppy sloppy
work these are all points oh bomb rush
getting up high oh no that's oh my god
okay that covered some of that covered
some territory
wow that was that's next to useless
Nigeria Gatien didn't cover a decent
amount okay you're gonna get snipe ice I
see hope
nope fuck I like my bomb rush I like my
bomb rush no no this person out here go
you can only walk on your own color
well at least effectively well we're
doing it we're doing it we're doing it
we're doing it here we go nope nope
what are you doing you can jump to
people you can jump to people on the map
okay so I was trying I was attempting to
jump to people I'm going up going up
that's kind of dumb well
here we go here we go here we go as does
theirs grenades throw some bombs bombs
bombs
having pretty decent ground cover in
there with some bombs I felt good about
that
yeah felt good about that of course I
got a Inc tornado over here oh this is
it this is this could be it this could
be the big wind it's all up to the fat
cast so that's totally the big win it's
all to that damn fat cat big one and
your bombs made the difference Jack I
think it did I think my mom my bomb rush
worked bomb rush worked congratulations
everyone congratulations John Kay
congratulations oh my god on top score
the team congratulations to me for being
the top scorer of the team I think we
all work together we all work together
as a team I have it all reconfigured as
final I'll deal with your considering I
think they do if I would love it if
you'd go left right that way to just up
and down you can a little bit left and
right not like that Ridge though like if
you think about it like a Oh like like
this no no like pointed at the screen
yeah no no like screen to screen lift it
up like that
now now tilt it this way this way like
that oh yeah you got you guys should
have just seen what transpired between
for tonight it was a little ridiculous
yeah well we'll use the paint roller
next rich you can try the paint roller
no Jack not at all no see you can turn
around you can look around oh my god but
then you reset with the the Y in the
joystick well oh my god
I was yeah it did it looked exactly like
rich and I were dancing like I was
trying to show him like how to turn this
thing and it was great it's so awkward
yeah yeah there's a lot of really
top-level like someone is saying like
there's a total horseshit the top level
guys are totally boning you right they
are that's that's the problem with the
matchmaking right now is is us still
trying to figure out the game are being
matched with level 20 people because
there aren't enough people playing the
game I'll get him rich get him
you were there rich was there with the
with the sneak down attack I do love the
sound effects all of them
oh my god if rich could play this with a
mouse and keyboard it would all be over
oh god I hate this controls game yeah
it's tough to get used to maybe you
should play some of the single-player
stuff just to just to feel it out the
game name should be splatoon did I never
update the stream to say it's platoon
that that's quite possible they said if
we change the game name to spittoon
movie that's top splatoon streamers
right now that's probably true yeah
that's probably true shit happens I
thought I thought I did Jane that
apparently not sorry
Oh God
this this is too much to get used to
while lying down that's okay that's okay
oh yeah it's a weird like you have to
use the right stick and motion controls
you know like the right side here you go
fuck it the right stick is for big
motion and then the motion controls are
just for fine aiming you know how many
Oh bother I know I'm not gonna have any
Oh bother beers right now because I
still have to drive home and I'm a
responsible adult but when it's time to
drive home I'm grabbing all of the Oh
bother beers I don't like the way you
have to turn it huh Oh God five deaths
zero kills oh it's alright rich you're
still learning but I want to say there's
only three Oh bother beers left here and
I'm taking them all fuck everyone else
those are my beers tonight I had a very
long oh my god I actually I still have
work to do Oh pause what's right oh I
forgot to do something I left when I was
uploading my videos to to a server I
have to give them to the client and I
forgot to email them yeah but that's
fine I can do it I can do that from my
phone so rich you know what one more
battle for you alright one more battle
cuz I have to have to do business pause
for business
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
of this so hard I can't control where
I'm going or what I'm doing anything
okay good I'm good business is done I've
been working on some commercials and you
know therefore they're fun they're
funded but they they are they're tight
there's tight turnaround times for him I
think I shot these last week
and I thought I'd have a little more
time to work on them and it didn't so it
was all albs all day today some some
commercials for an e-cigarette company
actually no not an e-cigarette company
is something I just learned a vapor
liquid company an e-cigarette is
different than a vaping thing I don't
know anything about it but they'll be up
soon I'm sure I'll link to them on
Twitter I'm not very good at this but
that's okay
for who the Oh for who though the the
company is called Johnson Creek and they
make e cigarette vaping liquids
I don't know dick neutral if my brother
would ever want to stop by the stream
he's not he's not a big video game
player uh he likes video games
he just got a he just built himself a
custom video game cabinet with it with a
little PC inside that has every single
game ever so oh yeah look up Johnson
Creek there they might some of the
commercials might be up you might
recognize you might recognize mr. Tim
Higgins in him as he's my favorite actor
what a wonderful work for me
yeah the ads will run nationally the ads
will run nationally and I think they
start running in a couple of weeks so
you might see them you might see him in
a town near you
oh no oh sorry I'm just reading Jen not
a gamer built a game kami he's not at
you know what he's not a gamer he's a
great host
he loves hosting parties and and he
wanted he wanted a gaming machine in his
house for when people come over for
parties what type of gaming machine does
he have it's a it's a custom-built
arcade cabinet that basically has a tiny
PC inside with every single game ever
okay but I mean what maem maem arcade
games
what arcade game emulator oh sure yeah
well not just arcade game though like
console games yeah yeah everything but
anything that has the joy it has a
mistakes it has the buttons let's just
front end oh I don't know I don't know
the operator spin or something I have no
idea I don't law looks a little
cumbersome to use but we're sure is how
I'm gonna try
oh okay
one-on-one all right we're doing our
goodwill holding our own for now but
it's not gonna last for very long
especially not if these fucking
tornadoes keep happening time to lock
this shit down he's got the high ground
I see I see I'm always dumb
fuck fuck high ground fuck fuck move oh
I got I got caught I got caught in ink I
got caught in the ink Rick I just seems
horrible what
that just seems horrible getting caught
in the ink yes shit
it feels really bad when you and your
character gets caught nope fuck fuck so
sick those nightmares you have or you
can't run oh yeah oh I hate those I have
those all the time Oh slightly slightly
better than nightmares in which your
teeth crack and fall out
oh yeah that's pretty bad well I I'm
really just like those nope ah yep these
leet splatoon players are really
sticking it to me yeah well not the
problem of multiplayer gamers games not
gamers well not I'm not all you know I
think not not to not to talk ill of the
dead but or not to praise the Dead nope
but I think Team Fortress 2 had it right
yeah with the different classes because
the classes had a rock-paper-scissor
structure you know where where some
classes just worked better at defending
against other classes and so you know
you could just be the heavy and you'd
have a ton of health while you're
learning the game mow down everything
and feel like you contributed or you
could be an engineer and just kind of
worry about defense while you learned
the lay of the map hey we won
congratulations
haha oh well thank you they are up so
some of some of the videos the reason to
vape videos RF that's great that's what
we're working on some reason to vapes I
get to do my voice this is my voice
reason of a Oh God they wanted something
a little country so I do that voice I
need less smoking smoking he's making a
comeback isn't it well vaping is doing a
good job of stopping people from smoking
but but the the jury is out on whether
or not that's good for you
secondhand something rather from vaping
I assume I mean there's gotta be
something in it right you don't even
know you do the commercial I'm a video
person I know I don't know you know
their checks clear I can tell you that

it got it down no I have not changed my
my thoughts on splits here and I think
there's a good game buried in here
there's a good game buried under the
weight of Nintendo not knowing how to
handle online multiplayer
I think that is that is the that is the
truth of the situation the game itself
can be really fun like this whole idea
of territory controlled via literal
territory control is a super neat idea
but I don't know it's just not uh
there's you think herbs gonna be their
top scorer did I think who herb herb its
the sniper oh yeah her bed the high
ground yep there's like you know in Team
Fortress 2 you know one out of every
like five games was was wonderful
you know you'd find that team that works
really good you'd find like you'd find a
really good match and so whenever out of
every five games was like super stellar
this so far maybe one out of every
thirty forty games is good and that's
not that's not good enough for me okay
paint rolling it out rich says al paint
rolling it here we go
yeah if you can get it for like 20 bucks
I say go for it button I mean really
just like ten if you can find it for 10
that might be worth it it's fun play for
a little bit and then it crushes itself
under its own weight
need Mouse need the next prereq review I
got pushed back because of work today
I'm hoping that I can push real hard get
it done tomorrow and have it up upload
tomorrow night so it's ready for Friday
that's what I'm hoping might not happen
so Friday Saturday maybe maybe not a
half in the bag or a best of the worst
but there may also be uh another video
coming soon what's a weird little
one-off oh that could be fun
