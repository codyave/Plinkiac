yeah where we need to go just gonna see
if I can come figure some of this audio
real quick so we don't get the the
crackling noises okay legato oh if we go
into Game Capture
configure and put this is just the sound
input device a switch could that be the
reason I don't think so but you know
we'll change it's a ps4 just in case
there cuz really know except for that's
gonna do that now there we go well see
if that's any better I guess because we
went through this last time where we're
someone sent me a possible workaround
but then I lost it because I wasn't it
wasn't directly in front of me you know
that's what happens play something at an
emulator I have no problem with this but
I don't know what the legalities of it
are and it's not fair for me to tank our
gaming channel so I can play an emulated
game yeah alright well we'll see if that
works
you over here and oh wait are you yeah
you're still on God of War yeah and then
great alright okay so by the way also
now that we have a new game it's after
8:30 we are in full
infinity war spoiler talk well it was
good so from here on out we will be
talking and about infinity war or
anything but if infinity war does come
up we're gonna spoil the shit out of it
so really heads up
so spoilers who's good at spoilers
actually pro-pro austin nick says just
showed up was seeing infinity war good
stuff laughed picturing all the crying
10 year olds last weekend
Jack it's pronounced Kevin Feige if I
Gio
let's let's talk about this have you
seen the movie yeah you know it has a
downer ending a very downer ending and
you brought your children to see it so
what do you what do you talk about that
that's I found that curious interesting
of course I brought my children to it
why they have seen all the Marvel movies
with me they enjoy them all they've seen
the trailers and they say hey my
favorite heroes are all in a movie
together and the movie ends with the
spider-man crying and fading into dust
so you know so you know the the movie
ends and my 10 year old looks over to me
and she goes what rocks what he was so
he was he would like I could see the
panic in his eyes and so I calmed him
down and I just said there's another one
they're making another movie so you know
don't worry don't worry you know making
another spider-man movie they're making
another infinity or move in and he's
like oh okay and that come to my own
media because even a 10 year old knows
that death doesn't really mean anything
in the movies or commonplace it's like
oh yeah come back to life it's fine
so I didn't even need to explain that
they'll pour that they're all probably
coming back in the next movie I just
needed to say that there's another movie
and he got that immediately that's okay
we know we know that in the comic books
death is absolutely meaningless right
absolutely people were saying this
Berkeley infinity war movie but has this
really been that true in the movies how
many death resurrections have we had in
the Marvel Cinematic Universe
specifically can you make I don't know
if we've had any Loki faked his death
but we knew we faked his death in the
movie he faked his death then right yeah
you know we knew at the end of the film
it wasn't dead so that doesn't even
count that doesn't count right okay I
don't think it's fair to label the
Marvel movies with this kind of book
stigma of death not meaning anything
well the the stigma is about to come
about now like that what what they're
starting to do is they're starting to
set precedent
I think Samuel Jackson okay
so that one does count I did they didn't
do that with no but he came back in the
same movie it was in the same movie yeah
alright doesn't count doesn't count cuz
they're not they're not they're not
they're not going back on the death it's
not cheap right because it was in the
same story yeah that was a count that
was all in Winter Soldier he came back
full Coulson and stupid fuckin TV show
doesn't count I know no matter how much
fans argued technically agents of shield
is in the universe it doesn't come out
of it absolutely Kevin Feige does not
give a shit about the agents of shield
show no unfortunately loki came back in
the same movie yep
the the one reputable thing i will see
is Bucky Bucky Barnes got killed in
Captain America the First Avenger and
didn't come back until winter so true
okay Bucky Barnes but that's one that's
legit that's legit yep Quicksilver
didn't come back Quicksilver has not
come back
never too late to learn a new trick I
think I would still count Sam Jackson be
if it happens within the same movie it
doesn't count and and here's here's the
real thing right are you ready are you
ready for this people who kind of die
and then come back and there's a logical
explanation that's not the stigma of
death doesn't matter it's when all the
sudden due to some sort of magic or
mutant power or godlike power that
people start coming back to life obvious
when death it becomes meaningless my
meaningless the threshold here is what
it's a retcon if the author intended for
that character to be dead never to come
back and either he changes his mind or
the editor steps in or some other writer
down the road says no no no that's what
it feels cheap I first of all you're
right that it absolutely is chief that
way but as soon as like like for example
if if they found the anti-death infinity
stone and that's how they bring everyone
back obviously like that's not a thing
right yeah and they bring people back
using the anti-death infinity stone
that's when death starts to become
meaningless because then if anyone dies
ever again they can just use the magical
MacGuffin and I don't know how they're
going to do it in the next movie but if
it involves some sort of magic or cosmic
power and then someone dies later why
can't you just use the magic cosmic
power again I think once you start
dealing in magical MacGuffins that's
when death starts to become meaningless
to me at least
so so if if you know someone is able to
get the Infinity Gauntlet and snap their
fingers and everyone comes back it just
becomes a it becomes a well we now we
know that magical MacGuffins are a thing
that exists and so anyone who dies may
come back later and then death starts to
become my husband what they do with the
Infinity Gauntlet it's true it's true it
might be gone by the ministry or
whatever at the end you know oh right
right but but yeah they're there they're
using up by killing fucking a lot of
people at the end there they're using up
there they're both using up a lot of
their cred but also being pretty clear
that these people are coming back but
like Black Panther just made a fucking
billion dollars and then he went away
into dust you know the Black Panthers
coming back you know spider-man is a
pretty prominent hero he's definitely
coming back Gamora gets thrown off a
cliff but James Gunn already said that
she's in guardians vol 3 so we just know
she's coming back as really that and
that was it for me watching the movie is
as soon as Gamora got got killed I
started to go oh I guess it just doesn't
matter who's killed because some sort of
magical MacGuffin is going to bring him
back
and so while I enjoyed the movie it was
a little like me you know like oh
they're killing people
but here's the thing and anyone who
reads comic books knows this thing
whenever there is a big crossover event
big things will happen that won't
necessarily affect your favorite stories
it's just a big fun thing that happens
then we go back to our regular stories
yeah so that's the real thing
yes sinner minik sorry we are full
Avengers spoilers we sorry if you're
just joining us jack on 10 years of
continuity coming to a head meth yeah
that's kind of how I felt about it to be
fair for the past week I was on some
medication that altered my mood in a
negative way and that might have
affected my viewing of Avengers infinity
war and I do plan on seeing it again
because my wife didn't get a chance to
see it with us and so we're gonna watch
it another time and I might feel
differently about it but overall rich
let me ask you a question my biggest
criticism of infinities Wars hold on
I've been drinking apparently my biggest
complaint about Avengers infinity war is
that it felts too fast okay there was so
many things happening and I don't feel
like they gave enough time to everything
and that's my biggest complaint well
they have frankly they have three
characters I think they handled it quite
nicely everything felt compartmentalized
and it wasn't about furthering all those
side character stories it was about
introducing and building a pentose yes
that's the purpose of the movie because
it's the you know it's the Avengers
infinity war movie and then the next one
based on you know who they got rid of
it's totally just gonna be the farewell
to the old original Avengers because
they're pretty much the only ones that
are left right so it doesn't make any
sense to develop like Spider
dr. Strange's character in a movie that
is dedicated to Thanos and the Avengers
primarily right but I feel like certain
scenes weren't given their proper set up
or wait like what do you mean a perfect
example is is there's a really wonderful
sequence in which Thor and Groot and
Rocket Raccoon go meet up with
giant-sized Peter Dinklage to make a new
weapon for Thor in the heart of the
dying neutron star and there's this big
sequence where you know Thor does some
hero space stuff to to make the metal
pieces of his hammer and then suddenly
they realize that they don't have the
handle for his new hammer ax but groots
there and groot grows a handle for which
is really cool yeah that was really glad
away but what I felt like they were
going for there was a Groot as the moody
teenager decides to do something noble
and I don't feel like that was set up
properly like like group for the whole
movie was kind of like mad being a moody
teenager like I don't care about any of
this and then all of a sudden decides to
to grow the handle because Thor really
needs you want like three scenes
dedicated to developing Groot Side Story
just so he can make an axe handle yes
and no it was crowded as it was yeah
well that's my complaint that's my exact
point a complaint is there there was us
a little bit of setup that Thor could
understand what Groot was saying his
setup believed elements in the other
movies Matt no no no him to him being
set up to be a moody teenager was
already in the other movies but what
made his turn to help Thor you know Sam
all right just just a couple more scenes
here and there is is my only complaint
these are minor because overall I did
enjoy the movie but there were a bunch
of
payoffs or sequences that I felt could
have used a little more room to grow is
it really that important we know Groot
is noble from the first film but
remember this is a whole new group this
is you know a whole new thing and he
spent the whole movie being a moody
teenager and then decides that he's
gonna help Thor and I did I felt like it
just wasn't fully earned again these are
minor nitpicky complaints but uh that
was indicative of my over Jack wanted
the movie to be longer basically I think
it might be raining I think it is yes I
did I wanted the Iowa I wanted and
obviously it's two it's two and a half
hours so they were they can't make it
super long and all of your favorite
heroes aren't gonna get the scenes they
deserve because it's a huge crossover
event Oh should I spend on my upgrade
that was you did probably dumb yeah
probably dumb should save some for this
special edition blu-ray is going to get
those scenes very possible but no I like
overall I liked it I just felt like it
was it was just a little too fast paced
just a little more room a little more
room booth
so I'm gonna get a fluffy fly me you're
gonna do what I'm gonna go to huh
falafel fly me there you go
I'll go to a football football and
falafel and yeah Jack wanted an extended
sequence we're Groot and Thor hang out
in a casino planet no but so they they
set up a little bit of a connection
between foreign groups because Thor
could understand what Groot is saying
and Thor you know had some kind of
backhanded explanation like oh yeah you
know boy he's an elder there you go
right I know and so like what I'm asking
for in this specific case is like one
more scene where like Thor does
something in Greek go and one more scene
any world would have made the movie
split down the middle I know blown up oh
I fucking know I know rich it was so
long and so much in it this is a movie
we you should not be talking about
adding anything oh I know but it just
seems so fast man
it seems so fast public masticator yes
rich and I are doing full spoilers full
infinity war spoils we're just chatting
about it if the chat probably won't last
very long as you've probably already
listened to rich talked about it at
length and I don't have much to add
besides I liked it but thought it was a
little a little fast fast yeah like like
I'm saying everything everything that
was happening very fast like this things
happen now this thing's that another
things happening a little more we
breathe but overall I thought it was
neat I don't know that I could say it
was faster everything to here we're here
we're over here wherever you can't I
can't agree with that statement those
fast
and again I was on mood altering
medication and I'm going and I'm about
to re-watch it later this week so my
feelings might drastically change so
there's a lot of caveats to what I'm
saying it's slightly too long I don't
know what you cut out but it's slightly
too long
you can't cut out anything you also need
to add and add some stuff and you can't
add any more length and all the heroes
need equal time but it was fun all the
meetups all the meetups rich classic
crossover shenanigans when the Winter
Soldier is fighting back to back with
rocket racoon those cute rocket racoon
wants to buy his arm off of them it's
great it's great when you know this game
is not called minute I will update that
right now Jack managed to successfully
beat minute on stream it's done it's
done I beat it
Drax was hilarious Drax is always
hilarious Drax is always hilarious
I want that character in every movie the
guardians are such awesome fucking
characters in general they're so so
inherently likeable well and and they
play really well with the other yep we
listen we got we got Doctor Strange Iron
Man and star-lord to bitch at each other
for an extended period of time that was
great
all that stuff with the three of them
were great the three biggest dickheads
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe get to
get to hang out on a planet and it was
fantastic
it was getting a very close to I clapped
the movie no it's a crossover event
that's the whole point of the movie that
we're supposed to have these fun moments
where the characters interact with each
other it's a movie built so you can have
the badass lady from the other Avengers
movie fight alongside the badass lady
from the Black Panther movie because
because of fanservice that's fun look at
that big Ford that's fun and the movie
was fun and also it was neat you know
the cool bad guys and Thanos Thanos
being super strong and the good guys
trying their hardest but fucking failing
all the time speaking of failing are you
gonna fail
probably
elites is invulnerable to worry them are
right now so nice and strong boom so you
need to kill all the henchmen boy what
boy kill some he and Valkyrie survive
somehow anyone you didn't see die on
screen is alive and even people you did
see die on screen could be alive when
the magic glove thing they could be
alive but I really think the next one's
gonna narrow its focus on Captain
America Thor Iron Man wasp Paco
Hawkeye the original score Avengers are
gonna be the focus oh sure but then by
the end of that movie anyone like like
for example Heimdall we saw him die on
screen in this movie
anyone we sucked I am this unscreened in
this movie they're liable to come back
to due to the nature of the story
they're doing exactly I take any death
we had with a huge grain of salt
absolutely absolutely and so like you
know because the the chat was if did you
see regular I meant to him that I never
just got around to it it's like oh shit
it's the night before I don't have time
it got away from me so you know that
that ship that Thor in the whole Quran
in the beginning yeah well Valkyrie was
on that ship I'm okay Heimdall was on
that ship Loki Whitley long sound low
key and so but we didn't see Valerie
wasn't on screen doesn't count right
what's any death everyone knows that
sure but even people we did see died
that could be undone by what happens in
the next movie because we all it because
we're logical and practical adults we
know that most of these people are
coming back anyway just because they
have more money to make for the Marvel
machine it's a new character that people
like the other
don't you
nope he just pulled a nope on your ass
Scott the fuck yeah he stayed gone with
other Oh
oh no you got him did you did but he's a
boss yeah he doesn't have he doesn't
have the hit animations there you go
there you go captain maybe Iron Man will
die maybe rocket yeah you know rocket
ships I don't think they're gonna kill a
guardian and amnon James Gunn movie
that'll be the big question hey I even
think gamora's coming back I think it's
gonna be a major plot point we're coming
back oh well we know Gomorrah is coming
back James Gunn already confirm that
she's in volume 3 we know she's gonna be
smoking mirrors I suppose I suppose or
an old interview from before maybe maybe
well and you know it could be captain
it's is it the Russo brothers again who
are directing the next one they've been
making Captain America movies for a
while so they do get to kill captain oh
yeah I think any of the original group
therefore game mm-hmm what'll be what'll
be interesting this is something you and
I talked about outside the stream of on
Sunday what will be interesting is how
ant-man and wasps handle the timeline
I don't probably take place before you
think it'd be interesting to see it take
place in the aftermath really really
interesting yeah but I think it's good
to take place before you just don't
think they want to dedicate that kind of
time
yeah or I don't know emotions
everybody's dead right I mean they
specifically they had a line dedicated
to why ant-man wasn't there you know if
they did announce that it was set in the
aftermath it would increase ticket sales
by a lot really what if that were like a
reveal now it really it really would
people who did not give a shit at all
like like me would actually be
interested in seeing the movie do you
see it man no it's okay that's fucking
ant-man I don't have a shit what it's
bullshit everybody loves Paul Rudd you
don't have to care about ant-man you
watch wall anything Paul Rudd's in boy
boy
make a dead boy make thing dead Captain
Marvel is going to make so much money
off that post-credit T's I see you
actually make you excited to see Captain
Marvel it does make me curious as to
what that beeper is isn't it because we
know the Captain Marvel movie takes
place in the 90s
yeah is it a time travel people you know
it's just that's what they had when she
left when she left whatever wherever she
ended up after the end of the Captain
Marvel movie she had a beeper that's the
only way they have to get ahold of her
sure now that was a nice tease is what
that was I don't I don't think that will
drive up ticket sales I think people
like brie Larson and people now
understand that Marvel consistently
makes okay to good movies so that's
what's going to drive ticket sales
his charismatic lady in a movie I'm sure
will at least be adequate sign me up
Captain Marvel is Supergirl in a
terrible costume no her new costume is
pretty good I don't know what the movie
costume will look like but I like her
new comic costume I think that's me
looking yeah captain Marvel's finally
gonna bring Scrolls to the big screen is
that announced is it announced that
she's fighting the scrolls I haven't I'm
not up on my cap Marvel news neither am
i let's see here uh Huff hard it's a
good evening rich I know you've done so
many reviews that it may not but do your
costumes ever distract you while having
discussions not so much have you ever
had to wear anything or or have you ever
refused to wear anything because you're
like I won't be able to sit and talk in
this for an hour I don't think that many
outlandish suggestions has ever really
been a problem sure go David in oh
people says hey it's Jackson and Dick
Evans you guys should play injustice -
it's the perfect time because ant-man -
just released a new trailer it's fun
trailer
it's a fun trailer I'm a big fan of
repurposing 90s hip-hop into modern day
action movie trailers Deadpool and
ant-man and wasps have repurposed 90s
hip-hop and their trailers and they're
both fine trailers
yeah it looks fun looks like a fun movie
this is harder than the Valkyrie yeah
this looks like it's harder than the
Valkyrie having to take care of the
minions before you can even do damage to
the to the boss you suck at this game
rich well thanks motherfucker how is
that helpful
Talon och how are you being helpful I
don't think it's intended to be helpful
that's what a man says if you're not
intended to be helpful then why do it
cuz you're a dick you don't get the hate
for ant man ID I don't think there's any
hate for a just lack of care yeah
there's a lot of indifference towards
ant man because it's ant man you know
ant man isn't a isn't a character that
is generally like on your kids bedsheets
you know not a household man I think
it's worth it to Paul Rudd Oh what was
that power
too bad they didn't let paul rudd play a
bigger dickhead it would be like the the
real dream scene for for any MCU fan
would be would be more Paul Rudd Robert
Downey jr. interaction like Paul Rudd
with Robert Downey jr. and Benedict
Cumberbatch I think would be better than
than star-lord with
Aquaman is going to get dumped on
Netflix at this point
possibly
poor Aquaman poor Jason Momoa that man
was born in the wrong decade and could
you imagine him acting in the nineties
who's I Aquaman tense fight Oh like like
in the late 80s Early 90s when you know
just everything was an action movie and
stunt casting big beefy dudes was the
thing to do Jason Momoa would have made
out like a bandit
haha
he turned down the role of Drax oh good
I'm glad I'm very glad because
you suck
Batista thank you Dave Batista is is a
is the now that we've seen him as Drax
is the only one who could have played
Rex how was it a terrible attempt
maybe I'll get this after all you keep
working at a rich you keep doing it I'm
not sure ma'am or can be funny yeah who
knows who knows who cares would you have
the reaction time of a 40 year old man
hahaha how easy did you beat the section
jackass oh my first try I don't know we
tie well he's easy
yes Batista was also very good in Blade
Runner hidden talent
as just a really good actor eat it
it's nicely done
nicely done
all right let's see here
rich says add tick claw when J compared
infinity war with Empire Strikes Back I
thought your head would explode I was
processing it more than disapproving and
I wanted to cut in that that Empire
really was more bittersweet hmm well
Avengers infinity war is just press is
or just a huge downer we lose everybody
loses there's no winners yeah fellows
the bad guy wins Empire ends with
everybody's looking their wounds we're
gonna regroup yeah looking out the
window
looking at the future oh they they got
Han but we're gonna get him back right
yeah
Finity Wars just we failed everyone's
dead spider-man just dissolved in your
arms everybody's dead
other people are stuck on a planet we
can't get him we can't get him they're
gone Bucky's gone
visions dead vision got his brain ripped
out of his skull right did Wanda die too
probably who care everyone's dead far
darker than Empire oh my god everybody's
dead
everybody's dead
you liked how it ended no to be
continued bullshit
well no quite clearly is yeah we all
know it's gonna be to be continued and
after the after the credits sequence
there was a fan OHS will return so kind
of a to be continued new its yeah at
this point in Marvel movies we all know
the score
honestly that pride just saved them
three seconds of screen time and we're
just trying to save every minute of
screen time that they could I know
I think you know the most depressing
thing was was Maria Hill dissolving into
ash
love me that called Cobie Smulders I'll
tell you why
now you do I do love me that Colby
smoulders she hasn't been a big part of
any movie but but she's always classy
miss Thanos going to have a reason to
leave his retirement battle that's the
next movie well we'll find out find out
we'll find out if this was his purpose
and now he's really gonna retire or if
he really is just a bad guy I mean who
knows if he's a bad guy or not
who doesn't see himself that way I know
but is that is that where they're going
to use to to best him has proved to him
that he really is just a bad guy
doesn't he seem like he's doesn't seem
like he's all that bad to me says
razorblade ad you know he just murders
half of every planet he murders half
half of every planet because they
committed the crime of being hungry and
poor so you know but you know it doesn't
seem like that bad again true blue
review says I have only two problems
with infinity war the first is that
Thanos is motivation may have worked for
his home planet but he has no reason to
think it's the same case for the rest of
the universe yeah he is the mad Titan
listen he's he's the bad guy he's got a
bad guy plan
it's it's not the worst motivation I I
don't know if they could have gone with
his original motivation for the movie
just because that would add a whole
other layer of complexity to to at all
I suppose we already did have hella but
I think that would have taken I think
that would have turned this into from a
two-parter to a three parter had had he
been courting death
I think it was more issue of the
audience buying the Rooter aspects of
Marvel's cosmology that's that's another
thing that's another leap that that they
would have to make oh there you got him
got him a little bit yeah that'd be
another that'd be a whole nother leap
oh no it's probably not hella whoo-hoo
we fell in love with but it was Lady
Death not the god bastard a mistress
death which I honestly after they we
just got done with the goddess of death
that would have added another bit of
confusion to everyone
but it's fine no it's you know it works
it works as comic book villain
motivation it works as I'm doing this
for your own good oh you can poke a ton
of holes on the logic oh sure
oh absolutely well especially the logic
that he sees himself as a good guy
that's where it really starts to break
down because it's just like oh man but
it's fine it's fine
everything's fine
rev valiant bloodshot says I compare the
Avengers films to be a fireworks show or
a carnival ride the fast fun dumb and
not taken seriously the deep story
should be the solo films r.i.p
spider-man hi Craig
this this this was a crossover and damn
it we got I think expectations because
of the first Avengers movies was in will
be incredibly high for just the
foreseeable future for every single
Avengers movie just because that first
Avengers movie is is brilliant it's just
wonderful it was a big gamble that paid
off in a big way but I'm not gonna do
this you're not going to do this there's
no that's fine but there's no there's
nothing wrong with a little bit of
fanservice and a little bit of dumb fun
in your crossover event movies you I'm
trying to think I'm trying to think of
of like the super funny moment the many
one of the many super fun moments you
know just the the the whole spider-man
Doctor Strange thing it's cute it's all
cute oh we're overusing our superheroes
Oh spider like that is adorable
that's just adorable you want that it's
not wrong it's well but Doctor Strange
is real it's cute he doesn't know that
exactly that's what I'm saying it's
super cute everything about it's super
cute
spider-man becoming the iron spider
though to be fair I thought this was
Iron Man's ugliest oh yeah ugliest it's
up there
the I never much liked the one from
three as much as I liked that movie
which one yeah I guess well the main one
uses in three I like I any of those
suits I liked the mechanical feel of all
of his suits they actually looked like
something a human would build and now
that he's yeah I hate the nanotech now
that he has nanotechnology and they're
very streamline and you know they don't
have the little gears and servos I
dislike to see I think it's ugly it
might be the worst yes and it adds an
extra layer of of MacGuffin ISM to his
suits now because now they can rearrange
to be just fucking anything okay cuz
there's gonna be done for the next one
probably figured we can go whole hog now
just go crazy give them all the toys
because these were killing them off boy
get out of my way
isn't Tony Stark a little outclass
technology-wise now that the guardians
are in the picture should be
mumfie presented that way Guardian tech
maybe maybe no one else in the universe
figured out his his special element that
he that he invented maybe nobody else in
the universe figured that out it was
just Tony Stark it could be also I'm
gonna say that while the guardians do
have a lot of technology it's pretty DIY
heavy you know it's it's rocket
duct-taping bombs and rockets together
so it's not as sleek of presentation as
Tony's but it's it's scrap built out of
technology that is alien and highly
sophisticated sure sure
although someone named chat is asking
whether spoilers are done and I'm just
gonna say we're we're spoiling spoiler
probably longer so if you don't want
spoilers you just go oh yeah we're not
only gonna talk about that it's what
most comes up I don't care what I'm
saying we're we've lifted these spoilers
restriction for the night
absolutely talking about whatever you
want to talk about oh yeah well yeah
we're just going through tips which of
course now is all infinity war because
we've lifted the spoiler ban which is
fine which is all fine will they bother
to keep animating Thor's fake eye or
just change it back to blue with no
explanation is it fake is it animated or
just a contact once do any fancy
animations I haven't really noticed that
I know it's a different color well I
think that's what they're asking are
they gonna keep it a different color or
are they gonna say fuck it in the next
movie and if they say fuck it in the
next movie is he gonna make some he's
probably gonna have a one sentence
explanation like oh I fixed it yeah but
contact ones is not the most difficult
thing in the world it's not the most
difficult prosthetic right or you get a
close-up and you do the fancy animation
and it pays off for one scene I could
see him keeping it
I could see it keeping them
at this point it's probably cheaper to
CGI the color than to have more contact
all day it's probably cheaper and easier
to CGI it
much like the Valkyries these people do
not these big baddies do not let you do
your big windup attacks nice end up
against that wall good good move good
move Peter Dinklage was great Peter
Dinklage who got to play a giant dwarf
which is an interesting sentence to say
everything is very fun in the movie like
I said it's just just just for you whoo
let's see here Brown Adam Sandler's has
thoughts on spider-man's death it was
the gut punch in the sequence dual sure
did you hear the theory that the reason
Peter is the only one who realized what
was happening to him was because of the
spine no that's the reason he's the only
one that that really reacts strongly is
so that could be the emotional gut punch
it's nobody's got the spider sense of
course you know just know it was we want
to make Tony Stark feel really bad this
is a bad ending so so so so Tom Holland
we really want you to act out this one
man that was what it was
they've they've it that that's that was
a three movie arc for those two yeah
like he brought him in in civil war they
had their thing in spider-man homecoming
now that was that was that was a really
decent emotional punch and something
that only the Marvel Cinematic Universe
can accomplish at this point also you
don't even need the spidey sense excuse
because he was the only one who I think
saw other people go first oh yeah and
he's smart enough to know oh right right
now but it's like it's it's such a neat
thing like seeing the emotional impact
after all of these separate movies
so pessimistic how was it pessimistic
the reason he's the one that was oh oh
it was for the drama that's not
pessimistic Ryan if we want to be super
cynical about it I can take care of that
the reason that his death lasted the
longest is because he's the most
marketable character the one you
absolutely would not have expected right
deaths granny
he's young so it's it's the saddest one
cuz he's just a kid no no no I was done
for emotional reasons not booth by
resentful thing the length of death
sequence is equally proportionate to how
much people care about that character
there's a reason that war machine didn't
get a big send-off like I think he
disappeared in a pile of weeds I don't
know if war machine even died I forget
because no one cares about war machine
and there's nothing wrong with making
his death dramatic for dramatic purposes
since it was just the right call
oh absolutely well like I was getting
into yes I just updated the title that
rear spoiler like I was getting into
that's that's a really neat aspect of
the multi movie continuity where we get
to watch them over the years
develop a relationship and in separate
movies and in from different people's
perspective and that's neat I'll bet you
when they wrote that they weren't saying
well spider-man's got the spidey sense
so that's why he knows it's coming with
that know the most traumatic thing that
could happen would be if spider-man ties
Tony's arms and will make it as hard for
Tony as it could possibly be so
spider-man's gonna beg for his life not
the fighters that thought coming forward
oh shit it wasn't war machine that that
it was Falcon the Martian about to like
I don't know you know why I don't care
about those characters I just don't care
one of them one of them died in a pile
of weeds I thought pretty much the only
people left were the original Avengers
and
well he was he was you know even even
though it was a different actor he was
there from the beginning
Rodie yeah oh yeah that's true
you know that's true so he's got a
reason to be around absolutely
he way I forget forget because it wasn't
Don Cheadle right it was uh it was a
Terrence Howard but technically speaking
he was still there
I'm sorry but Falcon is the coolest no
disrespect to the Falcon I just I don't
care about him like a care about
spider-man is all I'm saying
Terrence Howard as war machine would
have been great you know what it would
have been hilarious
Taryn man what a what a what an awkward
pairing Terrence Howard like trying to
be a badass with
yeah yeah they do you do where are we we
have a hunchback taxes as which MCU
movies do you consider critical to watch
before watching infinity war Civil War
homecoming doesn't hurt homecoming
hasn't hurt Ragnarok just so you know
why
Thor's in space yeah that'd be important
wait that might be it that's probably it
for like super necessary you might want
to know who dr. Strange's III didn't see
the Doctor Strange movie I was fine
The Guardian I don't know the guardians
but if you had no idea who the guardians
were oh I suppose yeah that's kind of a
big deal with them and fan eyes how
about the mall just watch you can watch
them all except for ant-man you probably
don't have to watch yeah that looks
probably you probably safe yeah so all
of them except for ant-man and you're
fine
no you kind of need to watch Thor to to
remember why Thor 3 is important right
flip Master Yoda and then you should
watch Justice League just to have a good
laugh infinity war why the fuck is
ant-man 2 coming out less than 2 months
after this and how the cleanser and this
is the third Marvel movie this year
Black Panther just came out in fucking
what February January olga bi I think it
might just be a palate cleanser people
just know that death and destruction
let's take it down it's calm down roll
like another heist movie lot of fun hey
remember that guy from the first movie
who talked a lot and was really goofy
he's easy this one too
he's everybody loves him van Julianne
Lily she's good she's gonna be doing
hurt and sure shit it's great that's
actually not a bad thought yeah and
really the probably the other reason is
they can they at this point they can get
away with it what else what else does
Disney have this summer why not when's
the one's the solo coming out probably
next Christmas Star Wars movies have
been sort of follow things if you follow
the pattern yeah I don't
next year is three Marvel movies as well
with with what Captain Marvel Avengers 2
and homecoming - shit that's a lot ready
to go train more these these these
special world challenges they're just
not easy man I'm not I'm not at a part
of the game that is easy
Disney has eight like eight big releases
this year it feels like it and why not
they make money on every single one of
them that's the thing as long as like
that they're just there they're fine
they're all good they're not making any
they're not making any mistakes it's not
like they're there shoveling out turds
looking at you Sony so you know let them
keep making decent movies I'm look I'm
looking at you everyone who's not Disney
solo comes out in a month
really what is that true that's strange
I just assumed the pattern would hold
and it would be their holiday thing what
is Disney doing this Christmas rich solo
comes out at the end of this month
what solo comes out in 20-some days 23
days the solo movie comes out that
doesn't make any fight that doesn't make
any fucking sense
infinity war is still going to be in the
theater I this does not make any sense
when solo comes out unless they just
have so little faith and so low is that
it is that it that could be it
that could be up May 25th is the solo
movie do they have little faith in the
solo movie or did they already do their
scheduling and not realize how huge it
was gonna be do you hear yourself speak
as soon as I said it I knew it was a
mistake as soon as I said it because
they are they the well they just got
done under estimating the performance of
black panther like black panther was
still in some theaters days before
infinity war came out
Oh gotcha uh Jesus Christ
solo is coming out like super soon that
sucks
I thought I was gonna have to worry
about that crap like six months they had
infinity war come out early so it
wouldn't conflict with solo or so they
claimed fuckas infinity war moving to
accommodate solo black panther was in
the theater next door when I saw
infinity war yeah they did not expect
Black Panther to have the light state it
had honestly that's just not a joke that
thing was also a next door to the
theater I see that's great I mean that's
that's great and also just a little
strange
rich people keep saying resurrection
stone I don't know they don't I don't
have one
Jesus Disney owns everything yeah
together do they absolutely do
Disney Disney or Amazon that's what we
got right now you want to watch a thing
go to Disney you want to buy the thing
from the thing you just watched go to
Amazon what's up with this guy's feet is
he an elf he might be a Dark Elf he's a
dark elf they got weird feet or so I
assume who has more integrity Disney or
asylum well Disney I do believe
genuinely tries to make quality things
so I'm gonna say Disney just because
they own everything doesn't inherently
make them bad once they start stopping
other people they're there they're gonna
be bad eventually Disney but right now
they're just making good things and I
think they're trying to make good things
so I'm gonna say asylum is worse they
genuinely try to make high profit things
yes but they understand that making them
well makes them high profit so
what would have to happen for Disney's
media empire to collapse the apocalypse
the the absolute utter apocalypse things
- incomprehensible big to ever fill
usually calls sooner or later Jack time
time eventually sunset the British
Empire at some point sits that's true
there there would have to be a whole lot
of miscalculations for that to happen
that there would have to be a lot of
mistakes Disney started making like what
once once Disney movies once there
Disney like animated features started
waning they started being really smart
and just started buying things that
already made money and and now they're
making money off of the things they
bought to make money and I'm sure they
are just going to continue doing
sweat socks
oh right uh hi jack rich says gee shots
I just read I am legion I am Bob on your
recommendation really enjoyed it thanks
for the tip and thanks for all the
streaming entertainment I look forward
to that I have that audio book waiting
for me as soon as I get done with my
super depressing history of racial
segregation book that I'm reading right
now which by the way is very fascinating
and oh and utterly depressing I'm a
little absorbed in that at the moment
and then I'm gonna and then I'm gonna
we're gonna lighten the mood with a
little a little fun sci-fi that's my
that's my hope and let me start with
hydrogen bomb
rich are you our new normal yeah these
are these are some of the channel this
is like this is the this is the
difficult challenge though on this this
is a special challenge area that which
is out so not not every
not every area is this bad
dougie Jones the book I'm currently
listening to him you know audible listen
listening to but it's also in print one
is called the color of law which is a
history of racial segregation by
government officials and it is utterly
and hopelessly depressing but very
interesting very interesting got a roll
you should a roll rich should have room
sounds like a hoot and a half yeah yeah
it's it's a bit much but it's it's
really interesting and and utterly
heartbreaking alright I think we might
be getting here the last that's fine
rich that's fine
we get we got a couple more tips here so
attempt as many times as you feel like
DubLi sandwich
what says once mutants inevitably get
absorbed into the current Marvel
Cinematic Universe they'll start from
scratch do you think the MCU will
incorporate the anti-mutant agenda or
will it ignore it altogether
I don't I don't know how the fuck
they're going I know they're going do I
have expressed the opinion before view
that x-men should take place at its own
universe because the x-men kind of
relies on this this pre-established
discrimination against mutants and in
order to have mutants in the MCU you
have to introduce them fresh like they
haven't exist in the MCU before we've
not heard
fucking shit about mutants before yeah
and it's weird of just suddenly they're
around and they're discriminated against
it's weird
I almost think they should they should
have an x-men mutant universe but they
probably won't do that and I don't know
I have no idea how they would handle it
well here would be the the proper way to
handle it was it would be not deal
with any of the discrimination stuff in
the first movie you know you hint that
the key to the x-men experience the
other the the the really the part of
that is that they feel like outsiders
and that they feel different and so the
first movie is all about how they're
hiding right they're hiding their true
powers and yes you know you got a shield
up yep
so you know the first movie is just them
hiding their true powers because they're
afraid of what society will do to them
you know you could cite like you know
people like the Hulk and how people are
afraid of them and stuff like that like
we're you know they could use the end of
the current MCU kind of kind of to their
advantage to say you know hey we're not
Captain America
we're not Tony Stark how are they
significantly different were Outsiders
maybe maybe you give them a given put
more weird-looking ones on the ex-home
put put the real weird ones on that you
know maybe make it night crawler centric
because he's a he's a goblin looking one
and you know just have the first movie
them doing super shit in in the shadows
and then maybe at the end of that one
they make themselves public and then the
second one growing resentment towards
the mutant invasion on that that kind of
stuff it could work it could all work
i people aren't necessarily cool with
Hulk I mean he destroys whole cities and
people are mad at him a lot that's a
Hulk thing and people are okay with Tony
Stark and Captain America and Thor cuz
they're just they're good-looking people
the good-looking rich people right so I
think there's there's like a a
marginalization angle that they could
take with the mutants it would take some
setting up and I don't think they could
do it their first movie out is what I'm
saying those were commas cat no cap
isn't rich cap is handsome cap Iron Man
and Thor are rich and ants are that they
are either or they are rich or handsome
or created by America or gods or rich or
handsome all the above that's what I
meant it sorry not that Captain
America's rich even though he might be
at this point will you're right I do
have gems for Dark Elf damage resistance
I bet caps the kind of person who
invests his money wisely he's been
hanging out in the condo like he doesn't
need to pay rent
that's an American crane had Christ yes
we are we're all we're talking all the
spoilers I put it in the title so hard
to be rich on the run okay he's
good-looking he's an American Hero
everyone loves him
everyone loves captain caps been
collecting interest on a hundred plus a
year bank account exactly he doesn't
have to work anymore
he fry he fill up J Friday he's cat he's
got that in had bank account do you know
you can get an Infinity Gauntlet in God
of War I did not know that like a
licensed Infinity Gauntlet like haha
yeah like like the the forever glove is
what they call it the golden forever
glory is it in partnership with Marvel
is like a promotional thing oh no all I
can't imagine what up
why can't you imagine they've done
weirder the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
are in Justice do yes I can't imagine I
that's we're talking Disney how much how
much they're gonna pay Disney for that
even though like now the Avengers are in
like home insurance and cholesterol
medication commercials I don't I can't
imagine God of War paying a lot of money
for them
oh yeah and this is the Sony stuff well
maybe you know Sony and Marvel have been
they've been friends lately they're
saying it's not official it's just very
similar but it is a reference look up
sure I haven't seen it so yeah let's see
here
true blue review says my other problem
with infinity war is that there were
several times a character there were
several times the character letting
another character die would have stopped
Thanos's playing entirely most notably
Gomorrah with nebula and Wanda with
vision and to add to that
I know it's trainable that our heroes
don't want to let other people die
strange dr. strange an Iron Man yeah dr.
strange an Iron Man no that one you're
wrong about what dr. strange letting
Tony live in exchange for giving Thanos
the gem right even though earlier in the
movie he was saying if it comes to me or
the gym I'll sacrifice you right there
was also a scene where he meditated and
saw into the futures there was that only
that one future they want in yeah and
obviously this is something Doctor
Strange needed to have done in order for
them to be ultimately victorious oh yes
we will we will discover this as was all
part of dr. Strange's plan now you see
if a knows needed to get all this
because I feel that if Thanos did this
Captain America would be alive and
captain would do the thing to make to
make it all better whatever right right
absolutely
and he's gonna be a real dick about it
at the auction which is gonna be great I
told you I had a plan but right like
that's that's kind of standard Comic
Book II superhero II stuff which is you
know I don't want the person right next
to me to die even if that means half of
the planet will die which is fine that's
all fine acceptable comic tricky stuff
Tiberius Kirk says Jack is it okay that
after your story about your tremors I
nominated shakes the clown for movies
tonight
yes I think that's very funny so yes I
think that's okay Tiberius Kirk shakes
that clown what a punch it want one ah
let's see what we got here
James jamming tanasul expanse spoilers
so if you are watching the expanse and
aren't fully caught up on season two
heads up in the expanse Naomi gives the
thing Fred Johnson and everyone gets mad
at her but in the books they decide that
Fred should have it why do you think
they did that retention man for crew
tension I'm sure it's gonna pay off in
some sort of meaningful way you know the
whole the so far all the the stories
revolve around kind of the you know the
morality of war and the struggles for
power among Earth Mars and the belt and
you know Naomi did a big dumb thing the
pasta
for a good reason and you see him it
makes sense character wise I would
actually I would have been more thrown
off if in the TV version the whole crew
decided to do that to Fred Johnson
because Holden is kind of Holden is kind
of a Captain America s person where he
just makes the right decision even if
it's the bad one so I'm gonna I'm gonna
I'm gonna say okay I'm okay with it
valium bloodshot says I'm curious how
they will get Adam warlock into the next
one he's a part of the original story
and he was teased in guardians to
perhaps Captain Marvel can these have
been developed enough for him to have to
be the major player in infinity war oh
god no no no yeah that would be that
would be the dumbest move they could
made the the the the most likely
possibility is that after the Captain
Marvel movie captain Marvel's coming in
and she will be though Adam warlock to
help save the day Adam warlock was
important well for one he in in previous
comics he was Thanos's archenemy okay
but for another thing he had a
connection to the soldier oh the more is
going to serve that function what was
his connection to the soul he was losing
his fucking forehead for years oh as a
character he just had the soldier that
was this big he just he was connected to
this but now that wasn't a metaphor I
think I kind of ripped that off with the
vision right right right
okay the visions got the mind Jim I was
actually the comics it was more like
with the soul Jim oh okay okay gotcha so
no so he is not important to this story
he won't be a part of it I don't think
so and I think it would be stupid if
they tried sure yeah that would be weird
at this point no one knows who he is he
was teased in a in in like a to a second
of three post-credit scenes in well we
don't even see him we see his cocoon
right I think I will call him Adam right
exhausted chose wants to know if Howard
the Duck is showing up again right it
would be it would be as if Howard the
Duck came in to save the day that
actually would make more sense probably
more people know who Howard the Duck is
then they know who Adam warlock is now I
I'm going to assume that Captain Marvel
who Oh bullshit
who is Supergirl she's just you know but
she is the the big hitter of the group
is going to come in and help fight them
because that would make more sense as
far as their business game plan is
concerned
I hope we get an MCU Howard the Duck
movie James Gunn wants to do it does he
oh fuck yeah I'm totally down James Gunn
has been itching to do a Howard the Duck
movie since before guardians and and and
he he fought to get Howard the Duck in
you know the the post credit sequence of
yeah of guardians he wants it's so
fucking bad I don't know if it can
happen Adam warlock is more popular than
Captain Marvel who has their own comic
book right now does that him more like
everyone kind of right I know I agree I
agree with you jack
I don't think Joe public has any fucking
idea who the fuck Adam warlock is what's
what's really important is to understand
what nice you are in and and know that
other people aren't necessarily into
that nice and so like a monk amongst
hardcore comic book people Adam warlock
and might be more popular than Captain
Marvel but the sales on her comic book
might not even be that good but she has
one when's the last time Adam warlock
has been in a comic book
so I stand I stand by my students
Brow's cynic says how aware are you of
the Milwaukee Bucks and the a-teams I
know they exist that's it
yeah I know there's probably spending a
stupid amount of money so they can have
a stadium when nobody in the fucking
town gives a shit nobody nobody wants a
new stadium nobody cares about the box
there's not been a popular movement to
keep the Bucks in town and no but hey
it's been a bunch of dollars in that how
about let's make a new stadium I like it
would have been a better sale if they
said more touring musicians will come
into town because of the Bucks arena
like oh yeah okay
then we'll pay for it but no one cares
that it's the new bucks arena they made
the playoffs this year I had no idea and
have one of the best young players in
all of basketball I I can't tell you the
last time I've been to a Bucks game I
don't really know anyone who goes to
Bucks games but you know what I just got
done saying it's important to know the
nice you're in and now that the other
people might like the Bucks so I don't
know I'm not a huge basketball fan but
I'm from Chicago I have far more of an
emotional connection to the Bulls
from the from the Chicago area if you
want to get anal
all right well we almost done yeah we're
okay we're just about cut up anytime you
want to stop you've been you've got a
heavy was gonna the last truck you've
been pounding your face against a brick
wall for the past hour and a half so
anytime you're ready to stop it's a hard
fight I'm not giving up full
concentration yeah and it probably
wouldn't matter anyway this is our
fights listen
MLG Freeman says were slash are you guys
more excited to see Deadpool - or
Avengers Avengers infinity war a fan of
my favorite comic characters and how did
you think how do you think his
motivation is completely different but
otherwise it feels like Thanos oh that's
good
so you enjoyed it yeah that's good
I was also more excited to see Avengers
infinity more I think Deadpool 2 is
gonna be good it looks funny but yeah
that was more hyped for Avengers and
were was em he's not gonna waste time
showing off he's just shit done yeah
Thanos does shit he gets shipped done he
doesn't pose threatened he just gets
shit done
oh gosh rich do you have do you have to
see the solo movie for half in the bag
hope anyway you can pawn that off on
Jack
good luck buddy Oh guys I'm feeling
really sick I can't I can't I'm sick I
can't listen I don't want to see it
either
let's see your crane head crisis just
some Avengers today so just watched the
review and I'm sorry if this has been
asked already but how did Jay find out
that the action figure looked exactly
like him I know they saw idea okay well
you guys have the action we have the
action figure I heard about it from you
from Jay so I don't know how a chair mic
that actually figure just might have
been here as part of the set or did he
buy it special for that episode
true-blue review says lightning round
question who gave the press performance
aside from Boleyn Tom Holland that death
scene that death scene it was great that
was pretty good
that was pretty good yeah I don't know I
need another one which stone would you
want to be able to use practically that
space stone seems pretty wicked just
teleportation just move on down any
place that seems pretty you do a lot
with time you could do a lot with time
no doubt about it I don't want to like
rip like I just want to like get to the
grocery store faster I don't want to
like mess around with timelines and the
space-time continuum like that see if I
at a time Jem Jack I'd have a lot less
apology streams you know what I just
watched the movie how'd you do that rich
time stone Oh
yeah reality seems to be really useful
like that seems to get a lot done do we
what does like the soulstone and stuff I
don't know right
the soulstone seems to be able to stop
space Nazis so that's pretty powerful
stops him right in their track by the
way I was really happy to see it fresco
yeah I'm just happy that Hugo Weaving
still working man I showed up it was
just nice oh look at that
a little a little character that's great
let's see which someone Julia's use and
which combination of characters would
you want to have their own movie I just
thinking of fun fanservice stuff that
the the Winter Soldier and rocket racoon
team-up was really funny and give them a
little buddy cop movie where they just
shoot everything be done I'm done and
and a badass ladies of fighting movie a
black widow and head lady of the black
man third ladies that was great I'm
being informed that it wasn't Hugo
Weaving right Hugo Weaving put his foot
down and told Marvel never again after
Captain America apparently he didn't
enjoy the experience then who was that I
don't know I didn't notice the
difference but then again it's been so
long since I've seen sure First Avenger
I suppose they just got to look alike
well shit well I guess it was just nice
to see the Red Skull - it's just a
little who was it then
it was Ross Marquand of the micro
impressions guy on YouTube really they
got it they got a fucking Hugo Weaving
impersonator cameo mm-hmm yeah well
there you go
well there you go it was not relieving I
color me shocked color me shocked not
necessarily appalled but shocked yeah if
if all of a sudden the Hugo Weaving
impersonator like becomes the main
villain in a movie then I'll be appalled
the first time it roles been recast but
recast as someone russian who does an
impression of the first actor i you know
what actually i wonder hmm i wonder if
the actors guild would get involved with
that no idea i wonder if there's a union
rule against that
when will your God of War review be out

we are at James Farr who says thanks for
all the great content guys WTF pone I
believe 87 sure loan an who says they
should really just rename the Avengers
movie movies Tony Stark gets more PTSD
poor guy
they should just rename every Avenger
movie poor Pepper Potts
why is she sticking around she's ash why
she why she's sticking around I think
she's I think I don't think she blew
away Jack it's very possible but you
know like after after the first couple
of kidnapping and iron Manning and then
pepper gets kidnapped and then Tony
almost blows up and then pepper gets
kidnapped again eventually she's just
got to be like I have to get out of this
relationship Tony don't you think I I
don't know what the motivation for the
fictional character is to stay in the
weird relationship it's because she's a
fictional character and she stays in
there because because we like Tony to
have a love interest who he talks to
occasionally your wife he found out she
was a superhero would you ditch her
oh god no okay well then she's got to
stop complaining just just know what you
got know what you got pepper you're
married to a billionaire superhero
you're fine or they're not married yet
but yeah by the way can can I say I was
we've probably talked about this at some
point but just speaking of Pepper Potts
in superhero movies yeah I was
unreasonably excited when Gweneth
Paltrow showed up at the end of
spider-man homecoming
oh oh that's scene yell like way at the
end of spider-man homecoming Gwyneth
Paltrow is just there and ready to do
her stuff as Pepper Potts but she's been
missing for like eight movies
I was like oh go ahead fulcrums back how
nice fun I just say what I'm saying is I
was being unreasonably excited they
applaud she left him over
age of Ultron in age of all yeah and
well they implied she less than that
Tony straight-up said we're taking a
break in Civil War and so like yes she
was just gone
yeah and and then also she's like come
back now that's fine
I'm pepper exactly
oh I listen I know there were some
behind the scenes dealing I just liked
it I just like that that pepper came
back all right
unhhhh reasonably excited let's see
where we're at blind you blind unlined
is what we're at true blue review for 18
months in a row says hot take got aboard
and have the kind of story it had to
mature with its audience but so that it
would be more like these stories of the
Triple A ps4 games of the last few years
maybe we'll get into that we got a whole
review where we talked about that a
true-blue review that's why we can't
talk about it much right now we just
talked it out we're done a clockwork
Stalin for 42 motherfucking months in a
row
Gino suave for 17 months or in a row
says when I was 17 it was a very good
year it's another song I don't know what
though it was a very good year yeah it
took my tongue took my brain I think II
all I can do is think of The Simpsons
parody when I was 17 I drank some very
good beer I drank some very good beer
that I purchased with a fake ID my name
was Scotty McGee
I stayed up listening to Queen

Sagan 12 24 39 motherfucking months in a
row Diggs II do pest freak for 12 months
in a row says love you guys thank you
GTA 2 for 2 9 the real van for 30
fucking months in a row since since we
already saw everyone punched Thanos in
the mood of it since we already saw
everyone punched Thanos in this movie I
hope the next one will be some kind of
Ocean's eleven slash Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows mashup to get the
stones back that would be something
interesting we haven't seen before in
the MCU
I guess they listen we know we met man
barely got punched he barely got well he
got a fucking axe in his chest
so that's kind of like a punch I mean
like we're missing some heavy hitters
coming in to part 2 here so they're
gonna have to pull off some sneaky
bullshit Kevin Feige if he / g this phi
g 5g he's been to date he has been smart
yes and i don't think it's just gonna be
they all grouped together and punch him
in the face
no i don't they can't do that they're
gonna do something clever well that's
what I'm saying they don't have the head
hitters so they're gonna do some sneaky
bullshit it's gonna be great I mean
they're gonna punch someone else in the
face so they can do something clever
maybe probably but they're not gonna
with hunch Santos in the face what else
Captain America is gonna punch other
people in the face while they do
something sneaky yeah Kimora's gonna
make him feel sad she's dead she's your
souls alive Gamora is 100% going to be a
factor hmm I like that 100% going her
her soul is gonna honk is he had to give
him her soul to get the soul stone so
now her soul is bonded to the soul stone
