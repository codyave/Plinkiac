this way we're doing great I had to I
had to eat two of my weapons I got two
weapons and I had to eat both of them
but both times I ate them I doubled the
power of my main wand yeah and I can't
run out of both with my main one and it
just takes a while to recharge so yeah
I'm pretty powerful at this exact moment
good work jack
I feel I feel like this is a pretty good
run
typical pyc says we will all be dead
infinitely longer than we're alive
that's true that's true and it's not
true oh when you're dead you can't
experience time death is the complete
lack of experience whoa the experience
of death will seem like no time at all
so in a sense you were alive for an
infinitely longer time then you will be
dead good night everybody I mean that's
there's there's no there's no greater
Tibet now I'm just gonna go get some
water so so really rich both are
infinitely longer it just depends on
your perspective yeah from your
perspective you will be a lot you will
be alive infinitely longer than you are
dead from anyone else's perspective you
will be dead infinitely longer than you
are alive mm-hmm
welcome to previously recorded
philosophy 101 for dummies

minutes away from the fucking Windy City
Thunderbolts yeah up north there was the

hey you know and that out there yeah I'm
sorry I hate to be the bearer of bad
news but that's Drive
that right there is a drive I was
thinking of lacrosse lacrosse is like
3-4 hours yes the Kane County Cougars I
only been to one of their games though
well there was just so there's a much
larger population in check out in the
Chicagoland area than there is sure whoa
whoa look at this spell Viper fangs okay
I'm having a good run I got a cool spell
it's called Viper fangs there's a Viper
fangs see it does but it poisons people
what
sadly guck says what a strange variety
of parenting out there today I saw alien
covenant for the second time oh wow the
stroller with the built-in tablet was in
the theatre and the toddler inside known
in every scene yeah I'm so fucking sorry
oh yeah that's that's that sucks man
parents need to know better like I get
it parents want to see movies too but
you know get you got kids you can't all
right you can't wait till that shit
comes to video-on-demand uh your dingo I
have absolutely zero interest in seeing
the new alien so I'm probably not going
to see it I think Jack feels the same
way pretty much pretty much Michael
Cody see a suds when I was in college we
had a roommate who for whatever reason
ripped our oven mitts cos he was nuts
he used pliers to get the pan out the
sad part is I still do this also is
Gillian coming back Gillian coming back
these pliers ah that's crazy man I said
you know just punch up your shirt no
it's it requires first of all sane for
you first of all your shirt but you sure
to grab it and take it up put on top of
them if you are if you are in your
kitchen most likely there is a towel
right in front of you not my kitchen for
get your shit together then rich Karen
has proper like haven't been somewhere
in the kitchen Alvin my bachelor days no
towel no you're a crazy man you're crazy
man okay so let me take my shirt off
remember Jack I'm the man who almost
burnt his grandmother's house down oh
and I guess I'm starting to see why that
happened I guess okay so in every other
kitchen except for rich Evans's kitchen
there will be a towel there that will
act as a fine oven mitt
I just need to I just need to get a
secondary heaven man it's not this
stupid what is your worst theater-going
experience jack
oh oh you know what I I was I went to go
see like a big-budget blockbuster movie
but the only place it was playing was
that like a small indie theater huh
which had terrible sound and it was only
playing in 3d and so it was a small
indie theater with tear it was a big
blockbuster movie with terrible sound
seeing it in 3d and it didn't look like
it was done correctly and so the visuals
were horrible and the audio was bad and
there were ill oh it was also a theater
no it wasn't an indie theater it was one
of those dinner in the movie places and
we had like a coupon to go there or
something or someone gave us a gift card
to go there yeah and it sounded terrible
and there were waitresses bothering us
that was pretty bad I saw the Dark
Knight like that isn't it the worst yeah
it wasn't worse but the Dark Knight was
good enough it kind of made up for it
yeah yeah I guess I could see that yeah
yeah yeah that was my worst movie going
experience there like it was a dinner in
a movie place bad sound the 3d looks
weird and their waitresses and we only
went because we had a gift card like
someone gave us a gift card to go there
or something my worst my worst
theater-going experience oh you weren't
you weren't here last room you didn't
hear me talk about this I didn't talk
about this this this particular story
but my uncle was there I talked about I
have six uncles one of them yeah raging
alcoholic you know what I think I was
listening into this part of the tree Oh
raging fucking alcoholic and one of the
points in my my childhood where he was
kind of on the wagon yeah
we had like a family outing he was with
us at the theater
we saw the fugitive okay his girlfriend
was with and they were a fucking odd
pair as much of a raging alcohol
I guess he was he could be he was
relatively handsome at least compared to
his his girlfriend who who is not
handsome at all it was kind of like a
human cow she had this weird skin I
don't know what was going on but it
looked like her fucking face was made
out of leather oh my god uh and she like
she didn't talk much she did you can
barely anything to say she's a really
fuck bizarrely odd woman and she's
sitting near me at this theater we're
watching the fugitive as a family outing
and this this chain-smoking woman her
leg is vibrating the entire movie and
she's got change like in her pocket she
the entire the entirety of the fugitive
has ruined me because all I could hear
was it was insane it was fucking insane
that's far worse than my experience oh
that sounds like hell that sounds just
like hell
hee hee she must have been loaded or
something he must have been like
mooching off of her I don't know what it
was there's something odd going on there
sure sure
oh man
strange
some blue guy enchants hey guys
alright remember when I asked if Dark
Souls gameplay good work in a sci-fi
setting the surge supposedly the surge
which just came out is trying to be that
are you considered checking it out yes
okay there you go there's your answer
yes uh someone told me about that a long
time ago and I've been actually meaning
to check it out I have not had a chance
yet but I we will well i'll either
stream it or we'll do something with it
sorry I called it I knew it as soon as I
heard it and I called it by the way last
stream we listening to the part where I
was talking about my drunk uncle at my
grandmother's funeral yes me first
I'm the oldest me first but like I heard
casket okay so here's my question so you
so tell the story again - a quick
wrap-up for anyone who didn't hear the
story cuz I heard that part
I was listening in I couldn't be here
like oh but I was listening at my
grandmother's funeral came time to for
the pallbearers like you know put the
coffin into the thing last time last
time you see your grandmother like they
called for the you know the kids to come
up and my uncle my uncle my drunken
alcoholic uncle who did nothing but like
mooch off this woman it was the younger
brother who fucking paying for
everything right right pushes his way to
the front of her coffin like like shoves
people out of the way saying me first
I'm the oldest I know well ok and you
know here I guess that answers my
question partly because the ways it
sounds is like the priest asked the
children thanks something I don't
remember the details well gone but like
was it like like 12 and under come and
say goodbye or was it like her kids your
kid okay kids the way you told the story
is like it may seem like little Timmy
and his friends wanted to go but but he
pushed by like schoolchildren not not
like her kids does it matter
what's the fucking matter
no this is why rich doesn't drink people
hey that's fair man I I had so many
examples on one on what not to do
oh man yeah most most Oliver binge
drinkers even the ones the uncles that
weren't alcoholics I'm sure they're all
mean drunks oh yeah it's the word yeah
like I grew up around a lot of drunks
that's a lot of fuck that's a lot of my
family yeah you get that you get to see
her you're you're sweet goofy uncle turn
into like a you know a rageaholic drug
every now and then yeah that's no good
that's no good
and then dry out at my grandmother's
house and you'd hear him in the other
room gonna all fucking night
it's terrifying that is terrifying it's
terrifying that's no wait and that's
nobody that's no way to grow up
there's no way to grow up like we were
fuck you know I was great I never I
never fell into that trap and I had all
the examples on what can happen
I suppose it was great and they don't
hindsight yeah well yeah yeah I'd say
yeah we were all we were all happy
drunks over in my house just the one
that wanted you to teach him the
Internet rich yes it is yes it is
Justin Voorhees is jack-jack
recommendations for good robe likes that
aren't Isaac spelunky risk of rain and
the like maybe some lesser-known ones I
like games with fun power-ups FTL but
that's another one we've talked about to
death fun power-ups like like Isaac you
know sure if you if you haven't done it
if you haven't played it nuclear throne
is is a lot like Isaac you know it's a
twin stick roguelike it's interesting
you get a lot of really fun weapons
there's a lot of neat characters in it
mhm
the downside is that it is hard as
mother fucking balls right she put away
a question from when Jack came back I
think I think I went back to it let me
double-check
um oh I think I did forget to go back
thank you none of us says hey Jack now
my nephew was almost five I'm sick of
watching frozen and Lego movies okay
when can I start showing him some shit
in before ask his parents first I'd let
him put on me I show him some shit in
before I ask his bird fuckin ask his
parents man I get how much time you
spend with above five no not not ready
uh you can show him whatever you fucking
want I I watch Robocop when I was a kid
I just loved it it depends upon the kid
and what they're ready for but keep in
mind he's gonna blather about whatever
you show him so his parents will find
out absolutely
gotta start him light start started
heaven you know what start showing him
really cool behind the scenes stuff from
movies that he likes and that will start
laying the seeds that movies are fake
that's super important like that's
really important to me like movies are
fake they're fun to watch but they're
fake like because I don't want my kids
freaking out if they see anything that
you know like movies are fake right so
start laying the seeds that movies are
fake I'm of the opinion that you wait
you wait til that kids like seven eight
ish then you can start showing them some
weird shit but like we said you know
when they're ready you know when they're
ready I'm trying to think of like what's
something what's something on the
lighter side of weird like you don't
wanna you don't want to go hip deep into
Robocop
like you don't want to throw someone
into Robocop you wanna you wanna yeah
but you grew up around horror movies -
yeah all right all right
ah I'm trying to think what's a good
like bridge for something like that
obviously it's Evil Dead 2 obviously
Evil Dead 2 Dredd
something like Jurassic Park maybe like
Jurassic Park is really intense that's a
really intense movie but maybe it's a
good movie good shit have some kids Big
Trouble in Little China some of the chat
is bringing that up it might not be a
terrible suggestion they wouldn't get it
they'd be too young to get the joke
though but but a hero who's a boob but
it has it still has a lot of good fight
scenes and slaps yuck
yeah I want to look into that by the way
that's just a great suggestion
that room
in here great Big Trouble in Little
China
yeah that's not that has some cursing
but if you if your nephews okay okay I
already heard the cursing well I don't
know some kids haven't if if your
nephews already curse and big from a
little China might not be a bad idea if
he's okay with kirsten and like super
low-key races and i think that'd be fine
actually that's not low-key racers it's
just just racism big trouble a little
china yeah wasn't one of the uh wasn't
one of the uh and forget it forget it
forget it
and i might be thinking of a different
movie so uh yeah let's just forget it
scuba double-o one says hey Jack I'm
Jack I noticed that you like Kubo and
the two strength fuck oh coupon the two
strings is on Netflix everyone that
movie is severely underrated oh man it's
so good it's so fucking good I saw in
the theaters and just the other night
just Saturday night we were looking for
something to watch with the kids and
going through Netflix and Kubo's on
Netflix now oh it's gorgeous and a bunch
of people were giving me shit cuz I've
made a little tweet I made a little
tweet just being like hey kudos on
Netflix and it's wonderful everyone's
like that so this kuku bow is the dumb
movie it has no story and they're wrong
and they should shut up it's a beautiful
movie it's a very simple story
Kubo in the two strings simple story is
not the same as new story going back on
what to start kids on yeah yeah one of
the Goonies my kids have seen the
Goonies um the nice in-betweener yeah
girls the life side of in-between yeah
it still has it like Goonies is tough
over like that movie opens on a guy
hanging himself the opening shot of the
movie is the bad guy pretending to hang
himself in a jail in jail so this is
true I forgot about that right but also
like some really great villains like the
villain city by the corpse
warps the villain sticks chunks hand in
a blender
yeah Goonies is a great in-betweener
okay okay sloth is fuckin weird some
slight romance stuff that your kid won't
get chatter saying gremlins maybe what
what up what up huh why not no say maybe
okay you sound unsure though uh it's
been a while since I've seen gremlins
are you thinking it's too harsh maybe I
don't know it's been it's been a while
since I've seen gremlins much to my
dismay whoa whoa whoa whoa it's just
been a while since I've seen it is it
too harsh they go they go nuts at the
end but like I'm just trying to think if
they do anything like PG pg-13 no PG no
that's right my there's PG three that's
why this pg-13 but technically speaking
it's still Fiji
I'm movin on movin on movin on up to the
oh by the way you know like you keep
getting that tip from from typical POC
yeah and so all it makes me think about
is a Michael Jackson song PYT oh yeah I
want to love you be watching pretty
young thing Oh wrap you in my lovin arms
so I recall that well I have I just have
PYT stuck in my head for everyone
now hopefully it's stuck in everyone
else's head pretty young thing like a
Jackson is great someone of a chance
bringing up Dark Crystal I've never seen
Dark Crystal
yes you know tried wait who tried it a
lot of beautiful effects mastery nice
puppets in that ya story was and Karen I
just didn't do much for me ah okay
I heard of making that there should be a
Netflix though oh yeah we're making like
a seasonal monado ya gotta see that good
puppets I hear good puppets obviously
because you know Johansson but
Dark Crystal has a pretty bland story
yes yes a thousand times yes
it ain't no labyrinth oh shit
legend oh it ain't no legend either and
legends not the best thing ever right Oh
No
yeah there you are you son of a bitch i
getcha I won't love you pretty young
thing wrap you in my living arms to the
servicer he watching tell me Michael
Jackson mask would be shit my room thing
says naira I'm thing pretty young thing
I'm with never net just night I'm sorry
I'm dreamin dreamin
eyes went somewhere else in the chat for
a second I looked over see what was
going on in the chat yeah
and I think somebody was saying pretty
young thing pretty out there and it
threw me off and I ROM says Jack were
you as drunk as you seemed on the last
best of the worst also rich do you have
any recommendations similar to Farscape
well into season 3 and want something to
watch directly after that mm-hmm
I'm not I'm not sure that I do I'm sorry
I'm not sure that I do but there's lots
of good sci-fi out there battle sure
Battlestar Galactica Firefly might be
Firefly I've never seen Firefly I know I
know it's one season and gets canceled
him I don't want my heart ripped out I
know I know I'm gonna uh I I was drunk I
was I was pretty drunk that episode I
was more drunk for Halloween the
Halloween episode I was significantly
more drunk I was drinking that at the
the LANAP asone I Obert home so don't
worry
but but on the drunken scale I was more
drunk for the surprise episode the
episode I did not know I'd be a part of
on Halloween yeah just as it just as a
gauge I probably you know I could hold
my shit so you might not be able to tell
the difference we might have been I
think in general we were loopy ER for
that episode because of that Beedie
Beedie Cooper versus Bigfoot man that
that made the night go in a weird
direction real fast
that movie was strange that BD Cooper
versus Bigfoot so like I think I was
loopy er for that episode but not as
drunk okay so and I don't want to turn
like me getting drunk into a runnin bit
for best of the worse or else that's an
escalation that I won't be able to keep
up with yeah so hopefully the next one
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna stay still
stone-cold sober and then it'll be a bad
episode and then like oh well never mind
jack drink again no I have lymphoma I've
done episodes before then where I've
been so sorry
everything's fine the chat is pointing
out some apparent hypocrisy on my part
on your part yes oh shit rich ah Firefly
Firefly this is a science fiction show
yeah
that gets canceled but it's wrapped up
with a movie after the show it gotten
canceled yeah so I haven't I haven't
watched Firefly because it got canceled
I don't want my heart broken right right
right uh Farscape is a series now went
and went considerably what three more
seasons than Firefly I did I went to
season four oh yeah yeah it's plan four
five Farscape got cancelled before they
finished the story and then they wrapped
it up with a miniseries years after the
fact yeah
how can i how can I not get away with
not watching Firefly
when I started watching Farscape in my
defense with this I didn't know yeah I
had no idea I don't even know that there
was like a running thread like a
storyline that was going to need to be
wrapped up
I had no idea what I was getting into
when I started watching Farscape that's
fair that's fair and like you said
there's more of it
the that's one of them yeah Firefly one
of the most disappointing things about
Firefly is that they're so little of it
because it is really good mm-hmm
interesting characters unique situations
very like fun sci-fi world universe it's
a little a little more sy fantasy but
they they do pay close attention to how
like the ship works you know one of the
characters is a mechanic and like a lot
of it is just dealing with the science
and there's just not that many episodes
and that is that is heartbreaking so I
get it rich I get it oh look at him
prime golem yeah the the Farscape
miniseries much much like Return of the
Jedi it's really good where it needs to
be good they the very ending with the
characters and the thing that's been
building up to four four seasons that
pays off but the rest of it does feel
like a condensed season oh that's too
bad
yeah we can see things right thing you
know this or that probably what I had
like a two or three episodes dedicated
to it
boom boom
I got nothing rich they got fucking
nothing so many health potions I'm not
even using my amulet
so I probably would have started
watching Farscape anyway because I did
hear about the minute and I would have
heard about the miniseries that wraps
everything up
I hear Firefly and serenity it's not
that quite as satisfying so I've heard
what I've heard serenity the buddy
uh I mean it works it wraps it all up
you you get you get an ending but like I
said though you just the upsetting part
about it is you just want more you just
want more cuz it's so fucking good
chassé asking if you know there's an
alternate fire to everything yes I know
I'm not using it um I know I'm not using
it thoughts on the new Klingons they
look like turds
they look like walking pieces of shit
nothing about that trailer made me want
to watch Star Trek Discovery I'm
actually less excited about the series
than I was before the trailer came out
they look like garbage
that's what
so they look like the new Ninja Turtles
kind of yeah they do kind of look like
the new Ninja Turtles when you know
they're really ugly and you you you can
plainly tell that what somebody else did
before was a much better job and why
would they do this yeah has a lot in
common with the Michael Bay Ninja
Turtles s sick burn sick burn like
alternate fire for your wand like this
is regular fire here P P P P ultimate
fire is more like a shotgun blast which
is really great the only problem is it
eats up ammo and does that recharge over
time it does but you know then you have
to just worry about dodging and so I'd
much rather have the pew pew pew pew pew
pew cuz I'm a pretty good aim and I feel
like that could take out more people mmm
my brother started washing next gen
because of the stream what what did he
think Justin for he's what did he think
Dream Theater 13 tenses what country
would each of you like to visit let's
assume you can teleport because I know
rich hates flying hahaha perfect perfect
yeah somewhere with a nice beach uh
Japan I would love at me really you know
anyone age oh maybe China and go see the
Great Wall I've never been over there
I'd love to go over there I'd love to go
visit Japan can i teleport away to
instantly yeah of course if you can
teleport there you can obviously
teleport away you know maybe maybe North
Korea teleport over pull down Kim John's
pants haha and just teleport away really
quick I love it I love it
wait wait the Lee's in public giving
some kind of speech or something yeah
right behind him put a ski mask on Oh
pants on just get right out a teleport
right behind him man teleport away I
love it rich I love it that's a grand
and it's a great idea hey just maybe
just taking like a shit in Vladimir
Putin's bed and poof teleport away poof
teleport away make sure he sees you
though right he's got it he's got to see
you crouching on his bed shitting right
and then just as he comes in his room
you're shitting on his bed you go like
this suckin putin poof teleport away
I've I've triggered my teleporter too
when I say suck it Putin and it's sucker
Putin it'd be great god johnson potent
family Christmas whoo shit the bed
starts World War 3 that's great that's
great
and I just want to go I want to go to
weird places I like I want to I want to
go as far away I want to go as far away
as I possibly can like I've never been
to Northern Europe I'd love to go visit
like Iceland and and and those kind of
Nordic countries I think that would be
needed shit I didn't need is shit sound
luck you're weak nope that's not what I
want this is one all catch some fish
catch some fish Go Go the mountains go
to the snow go visit Bjork hey Bjork New
York
hey Bjork New York cuz she did she just
does that she's like part of the
Ministry of Tourism and people can just
go visit her I'm sure right I heard this
song just for you I will let you play
the harmonica
that is my Bjork impression rich what is
the last time you had a ridiculously
fucking positive reaction to a trailer
thor ragnarok oh I I felt so bad I had
rich watch the thor ragnarok trailer
before a stream one night yeah just
because it was the hot new trailer and
we want to talk about it and his
reaction to that trailer was so fucking
good that I know now that I should have
waited and have him watched the trailer
live but the it's a great trailer
original guardians of the galaxy the
first guardians the Galaxy trailers
really had me hyped to see that movie
yeah those were good trailers behind
trailers and the mad the Mad Max fury
road trailers took away some of my
skepticism okay some of sure look it
looked good I was worried that Mad Max
was tied up in like every shot of the
trailer yeah like I was wondering if if
they weren't gonna be so bold as
actually actually having tied up for the
entire fucking mood just the first half
hour to take to take Mad Max being just
the character we see the world through
to an absurd extreme you know yeah like
I what they can do that they didn't do
that they kind of did for the first
action scene for the first fucking third
of the movie he's tied up but I'm saying
this is a good thing rich for yeah for
the first third of the movie he's
strapped to look he's strapped to a car
trailer made it seem like I was giving a
whole movie
ya know I think it's a good thing he is
he is a he's a passive protagonist for
the first third of that movie it's great
you feel lighter I know what that does
why is max mad because his family was
slaughtered and and his world is dead
the both are fair reasons both are fair
reasons but key he's haunted by visions
of his dead child what what else do you
need
is he mad angry or is he mad Crazy's
both it's both jagneaux
type of things I'd much rather have a
Viper fangs because nobody wants to
watch sad max oh oh speaking of Mad Max
have you heard the latest Tom Hardy news
huh Tom Hardy he's gonna play he's gonna
play of a prominent character yeah in uh
he's gonna play a cop prominent
comic-book character who's getting his
own movie care to take any guesses I
would have guessed the Punisher but
they're doing the Netflix thing right
getting his own comic book movie
prominent comic book character Tom Hardy
is cast as the lead look at Tom Hardy
he's bein right Oh max I know
Deathstroke the Terminator who dead he
be a great dancer nobody no no we know
we know what is it
I'm just saying he'd be a great
definitely what yeah uh he's why I said
destro he's gonna be venom in the stint
he's gonna beast and he's gonna be venom
in the standalone venom movie rich Evans
he'd be a great Deathstroke yeah look at
the chap that would've been cheating
yeah what I reach to guess they'd be
more fun that way yeah he's uh they're
making a standalone venom movie with uh
with Tom Hardy in the lead no word yet
whether it will connect to the Marvel
Cinematic Universe
okay the real van's is speaking of dead
mole videos oh yeah I've always wanted
to break into and explore an abandoned
house there are a few up here where the
owner died and no one claimed property
etc does that make you weird
no no but a guy could potentially get
you arrested yeah I'd say that makes you
human
these people who do these dead mall
videos are taking a chance but everyone
like everyone likes to explore but yeah
how do you how do you have a lawyer do
you have an alibi do you have an exit
plan well there's some kind of abandoned
like Disney theme park somewhere I
remember somebody exploring that I don't
know I don't remember this I don't
remember this
like pirate land or something they
didn't actually end up doing anything
with pirate there we go I don't remember
I have known I have no recollection of
this no I certainly did not do it it's
an offshoot of Disney World
a water park that they abandoned Oh
interesting River Country look up there
we go none of us says yeah that's
Nirvana song I'm doing a Nirvana so many
good ones so many good ones I'm gonna at
y'all I love something in the way it's
pretty low-key forget about a song I
think it's super popular
yeah that's it's there I'm throwing that
out there there you go there you go I'm
just not that big on Nirvana
heart-shaped box I like that
guess Polly's good then Nirvana is a
hard group to pick a favorite song of
because so many of their songs are great
come as you are you to me as a friend
didn't someone just use that in the
trailer once recently Shh was it suicide
spawn oh is that what it was
I think Oh suicide squad someone used it
well on a trailer recently I want to say
so maybe not suicide school
suck its Killington
that's 85 says rich I made a mistake oh
no men Shadow Warrior from 2013 you have
the old one wrist Shadow Warrior classic
Redux according to your steam profile
I'm stalking right now rich you messed
up you best up man oh I'll have to take
a look into this I thought I had the
newer one it could be I have both you
messed up I could have it on like GOG
sure cuz not every game I have is on
steam when I get something on GOG you
will hell I will yes I know that about
you so I might actually have it and it
might be on my gog account yeah novices
Twin Peaks or the x-files turn Peaks
x-files by default I haven't seen much
Twin Peaks over overall Twin Peaks
x-files has some really phenomenal
single episodes but so much of it when
went off to government conspiracy land
instead of like let's look at weird shit
land so I've enjoyed some of the like
the Side Story standalone episodes of
x-files that didn't relate to the
conspiracy yeah I never even bothered
trying to get into the conspiracy
storyline because I knew that thing was
never ever going to fucking be resolved
right right between Twin Peaks is that's
something special right there Twin Peaks
behind should do a next episode about
killer tix in the woods I'm down yeah
exactly exactly this guy's driving
across the country does brains gonna
explode am in I'm in they did it they
did a fucking episode with a genie a
real-life genie
by the only one who didn't want to see
Scully and Mulder as a couple no I'm
with you I could be were they had they
had then then good chemistry is just
like professionals working together yeah
I didn't I didn't really feel it
romantically I can be with you
nice Oh what
what I don't fucking know I shot at that
and it is given it up which do you miss
episodic television miss episodic I mean
like standalone stories and not like
long yeah
do they not do sitcoms anymore they do
those are usually episodic yeah I'll be
I'll be sad that the new Star Trek is
almost certainly not going to be
episodic you know it depends on the kind
of show I I really love you know season
story arcs I think I think that's that's
really good stuff before the dina
depending on the type of show I'm not
I'm not saying one is always better than
the other and every single circumstance
right there's nothing to be said for a
show or you don't have to watch it as
part of a twenty five part story right
there's something nice about turning on
Star Trek and that yes there's the
mystery this week here's the issue we're
dealing with them that we're done we've
solved that issue there's something to
be said for that you know I can be with
you
Oh cousin salesmen I'd rather have Viper
fangs Viper fangs Viper fangs
anonymous says I'm in my mid-thirties
and have never been to a baseball game
it's something you have to grow up with
to appreciate I don't understand why
people like it no you don't have to grow
up with it because I didn't appreciate
it until I was in my later kind of mid
to late 20s I was not a kid though and I
think you have to go in person go in
person you know what you have to be
there in person not it's not you know
not like a TV thing you have to go to
the ballpark you have to take you have
to ask me a table whether has to be nice
here's what I'm going to say to maximize
results and I'm not a baseball person
but I'm just going off some other things
I know find a group to go with find a
group of people who you enjoy and all go
to the baseball game together sure you
got a nice beverage you got got a hot
dog yep you got a game going on where
exciting things happen but they happen
in short bursts that's why you need
again you have time just to relax it's
like a picnic yeah it's like a picnic
with assigned seating it's like a picnic
and every you know every now and then
something really like bases will be
loaded something really tense and
interesting will be going on in the game
yep and one when there's not just don't
even know
beautiful day out friends talking like a
picnic yeah
baseball is great
that's my that's all my the thoughts I
can express on baseball okay great we're
doing great
we're doing great find a nice minor
league team to we can get like really
close to the field you know you don't
have like some fucking cheap nosebleed
seats in a major league stadium that
would that would probably suck I would
huh actually I've done that that would
almost certainly suck sure relative to
going just a fucking minor league team
where you're you're fucking 10 feet away
from the field and it's great I like
that now I'm with it I enjoy going to
minor league games more than I do going
to major league game I mean it's the
same baseball right like it's the same
rules why not yeah but there's there's
an intimacy when you're close enough to
hear players yell at each other
well that's what I'm saying it's like
it's all the same shit but you get
better seats really it's more economical
like this there's something to be said
for for heckling a player on the
opposing team and he actually turns to
glare at you ha ha ha there's something
oh I totally did what's totally dead
totally worth it oh shut up you get that
that glare that death glare Bastion
that's terrible rich we haggled we
heckle look think like one time we'll
the good catcher on this team so much
that after the game we we bought him a
beer oh good well good we so much now
you know what I'm pretty happy with that
that's that's good work you have this
weird routine like he only had to like
tap the bat so many times like before I
would sway I wouldn't we'd count ha ha
ha oh you're terrible that's great you
know what I love it
I'll fuck this wand boost is the
greatest but I lose I lost my grenade
and it really is my grade so go to a
minor-league game is what I'm saying I
like it and go go there don't watch
don't watch on TV yeah get a get a group
of friends people you like go to a go to
it and drink some cheap beer get decent
seats in a minor league game I like it
rich it's a good call ever been to a
Brewers game yeah is alright team sucks
I've been new Brewers game I just don't
care
oh hello whoa that's a fun gun
Anonymous's rich how soon after meeting
Mike did you realize he was obsessed

Mike Gallagher says I also caught King
Arthur last week Charlie Charlie Hunnam

director needs a fidget stick gods of
Egypt Award of fantasy TV meat grinder
what do we got of 2017 lukewarm garbage
King Arthur would warm garbage toast it
was a fairly easy one to spot from mile
away when it well but that's that was
Guy Ritchie right I believe I believe
it's Guy Ritchie and so I think the hope
was this story that everyone knows but
with some style and from what I hear
there's just no there was no style to it
like it wasn't a Guy Ritchie movie
some got some blue guy chances to tell
you more about quake champions it's
free-to-play where you rent heroes with
in-game currency or play them
permanently with grill money
there's also crates with cosmetics
because overwatch of course I'm not I'm
not a multiplayer guy so they're gonna
they're going the free-to-play route
which is very interesting everyone
assumed when Blizzard announced over
well yeah we're gonna go free-to-play
and they did not but that that of course
went over gangbusters I assume they
would charge quake yeah
charge when you can right

non movies so unless it did you ever use
it for a monsoon once or twice we know

meliss
lost in technical shows rich teleport to
North Korea put some super laxative and
Kim jong-un's drink before he gives a
speech then he'll poop himself in front
of the country and they'll see he's not
magical and really puse talk talked
about fun I had a baseball games now I
should ask them it just reminded me of a
story we're leaving a baseball I'm sorry
I Kim jong-un pooping his pants reminds
you of a baseball story that's the setup
that we're going with here we leave a
small Park once and this guy in front of
us is we're walking out yeah some kind
of special needs individual okay and as
he was walking we noticed this brown
who's running down his leg a lot lots of
it uh-huh and not all of the people were
paying much attention many of them
stepped in it and tracted all over the
fucking place it was absolutely
disgusting absolutely discussed it I
believe it shitty fucking footprints all
over the place that's very sad that is
very sad
please go to a baseball game it's great
just you know well look around you man
it's just this advice for everyday like
a watch where you step but he won't talk
about his worst fat experience because
that was actually scary just talking
about some pooping man like that's
that's well with it that's we're talking
about people pooping as well within our
wheelhouse it's disgusting and weird
yeah is what that is
yeah that's normal that's normal prereq
conversation right there
I'm too powerful this is great this is
great
all bow to me I'm Noopur wizard coming

film and I was wondering what you
thought of this film was also consider
it for review please thanks guys
not seen it I have not seen it it's
collateral the one with uh with Tom
Cruise I want to say yep I think I might
be thinking I mean you know I know I'm
not remembering exactly I like Michael
Mann as a filmmaker in general but
glancing at at the chat yeah just you
know I know we're we're not talking
about it but just just refrained from
Twin Peaks spoilers oh come on guys it
just came out this came out has no
fucking self control don't ruin it for
people who came here it's just tonight
instead of watching that immediately oh
cool man be cool oh man what are you
doing
headaches 1000 says hey guys I knowing
you like Starship Troopers
yes wanted to know what you think about
the sequels Starship Troopers two
three-and invasion also have you heard
they want to reboot the franchise with
lots of controversy now if they do a
reboot I have to imagine it'll be
something that's actually faithful to
the book kind of be it'll be a different
beast it won't be the parody yeah that
we got the satire uh I never really
bothered with the sequels because you
know I heard about them right right
I heard they're awful so yeah yeah
because I heard about them I never watch
the sequels because I heard about them
if somebody does spoil Twin Peaks feel
free to ban him absolutely absolutely
not cool we're all here having a good
time
where'd you see a having a good time all
you want to ruin it for other people
even if you're joking they don't they
don't know they think they're hearing
spoilers that's not cool man
keep it cool keep it cool dude it's all
we're doing or we're asking for you to
keep it cool we're trying to talk about
about special needs people shitting
themselves at the ballpark honestly and
that's what you guys tune in for that's
what's more important than Twin Peaks at
this moment is is people pooping their
pants so you know get with it
okay with the program I'm not not lied
about that you can ask Karen Xtreme
she's on it was a disgusting thing that
I saw I believe it here's the thing rich
I believe it
unit six third unit uh what the fuck
with it
oh yeah but were you get ready to wrap
it up no okay that's my bet that's my
bedtime timer it tells me that I should
go to bed if I if I want to get enough
sleep to function as a normal human
being I should go to bed I never listen
to that's your fuckin business I know I
set it up just to make me feel guilty
unit six oh three idiots else is Mad Max
the weirdest retcon in movies Australia
wouldn't get nukes since it has no nukes
so Nomad the first movie had society
falling apart but the second had full
waste lands what do you think it just
doesn't matter that much there there are
some movies that don't have anything
happening in the movies and so you get
caught up in those details you know like
he gets so bored that you're caught up
in a little who's in whatsit matt max is
not that movie for me I'm so caught up
in what's happening in the action that I
don't know I think fury road is stylized
enough that I'm not gonna get hung up on
something like that right right you're
just too caught up in what is happening
in the actual movies to start caring
about this extra bullshit maybe maybe
less so with road warrior which is
trying to be realistic and you know
relatively grounded and pretty sure but
but fury roads is almost like being in a
dream
it's an exaggerated world yeah I'm not
I'm not going to I'm not going to look
into the the like I don't want a fury
road prequel that tells me how immortan
joe got in power I don't care about that
mhm he's the guy in power I know he's
the guy in power because I can see and
be in power boom I'm more talking about
like the politics that got to the
wasteland one fact that there's a
nuclear war well that's what that's what
I'm talking about like that kind of shit
just doesn't matter Mad Max this is
where they are this is the story by the
way if you do have World War three
there's there's gonna be a lot of bombs
falling all over the place even if
you're not directly hid you're you're
gonna be affected by that shit oh and
not just bombs man like weather patterns
right that carries nuclear clouds all
sorts of shitty places mutually assured
destruction motherfucker that's that's
air buddy that's everybody's fault nope
that's not one on this one okay cliff
that would be true through destruction a
shut up shut up I hear you already
wasn't Mad Max first car in fury road
yes because those movies don't really
care that much about continuity they do
when they don't like they they took care
with like Max's injuries like the knee
brace from when he gets shot in Mad Max
like some of his injuries have carried
over oh yeah fun something like the car
getting blown up in the more they didn't
give a fuck about that no fucks were
given it's almost like it's a movie
right it's almost like it's all it's all
made up and they're just trying to have
some fun just some things they really
cared about the continuity of yeah
things you know that was a I remember I
remember reading an interview with Seth
MacFarlane about about Family Guy this
was at the height of the the second
surge of popularity uh-huh
and so I was like someone was like so
tell so tell me this
can people understand it when Stewie
talks or do they just hear a baby
because like sometimes it seems like
people can understand them and sometimes
people just treat him like he's talking
like a baby and it goes whichever one's
funnier it matters when it matters
who ate who heap and I know that's tough
it's tough for everybody here cuz
everybody here like us can be nitpicky
bastards about stuff like that but if
it's a good movie that stuff doesn't
matter then you just wrapped up in the
good movie if it's a boring movie that's
when you start overthinking it
wait you just figured he got a new car
that looked like his last car well you
know what he really liked that last car
so in a wasteland where you can't find
things easily and a car that was
supposed to be rare and special in the
first place yeah that's that's almost
worse than just the continuity error it
really is shit this is not gonna be
worth it yes yester noble kinsman he got
a new last of the interceptors oh my god
I can't believe a fucking did that I
can't believe it fucking did that no I
don't want that no I want my Oh what
what look at this look at this cool
sceptre whoa I want my other Hamlet
though no no what
not but I want that scepter there we go
yes sceptre of the undead shit yes what
was the most awesome movie before fury
road a favorite movie that can that can
change based on like the day of the week
and your mood alright since it's hard to
say you know our Fight Club fight comes
the fine movie my club is pretty awesome
it's fine movie I have issues with Fight
Club like I think I've talked about this
before where like I think it's a I think
it's a really good movie I think it's a
fucking good movie but ever everyone
around me at the time
saying it was a was like didn't get it
to the point of upsetting me yeah like
just so cool we should still room for
clothes sounds that's not was found man
no man let's so I think well I think
what we should do man is we should like
acts like how he may have acted you know
like stir up some shit now maybe you
don't get it man
I should are not just having fun what I
shouldn't maybe they get it but they're
just having fun
it didn't seem like they got it okay
it's that yeah you know what I will I
will add it to the realm of possibility
yes but it didn't seem like it
and Oh prom says have you seen the
trailer for Seth MacFarlane's new show
the Orval Star Trek parody that looks
decent and I know Seth is a huge Trek
fan so you might do it justice I haven't
seen the full trailer I've just seen
little bits here and there I think it
might be fine yeah Jack is Jack is less
enthused I
I think the Seth MacFarlane can be very
funny you know I like Family Guy in the
early days I actually I'm one of the few
people who defends Ted as a genuinely
funny movie I don't necessarily like it
when he's on camera yeah Seth MacFarlane
so having to look at him
I think like and and that might be like
horrible of me to say but he just looks
like an he looks like an asshole you
know and so but maybe that's part of the
character he plays so my work
whoa spikes fuck my club was about
reclaiming your masculinity it was it
was also about people controlling your
life and and switching one master for
another and finding out that it's much
the same and it's it's not necessarily
about reclaiming your masculinity it's
actually about the it's actually about
like the false masculinity that is
placed on you by society being masculine
being over masculine like if you think
about the character of tyler.durand the
character that Brad Pitt plays he's
supposed to be the antagonist he is the
he is the masculine persona that people
want you to have and he turns out to be
the bad guy we're supposed to be a
little more like what evolved then tyler
durden it's about reclaiming your
humanity not necessarily your
masculinity it's also about abandoning
this this corporate consumer society
that that kind of
trolls you and dominates your life and
they end up with Tyler who ends up doing
the exact same thing well right like
that it's it's about it's about the
trappings like it's not about your
consumer life and it's not about your
aunt ARCA stick life it's about the
people who control that right right
here we go here we go this corporate
life that wants to suck away your
individuality and then you're a Tyler
and you're chanting his name was Robert
Paulson
it was it's a big the same fucking thing
in a lot of ways of course that's that's
the fun
that's the fun twist that is the fun
twist of Fight Club
is it ends up being the same thing but
like I said I had a bad experience where
like a lot of people I was watching it
with just saw the core propulsion be oh
yeah corporations that's such bullshit
team mayhem more cool though like now
that's not the point
that's not for team mayhem wasn't cool
it's about finding your individuality
boom no thanks
what
oh I beat a bad big guy in boss
you
oh you beat it I beat it
oh all right oh well shit that was quick
I dead that's the farthest I've gotten
all right I I had some really killer
upgrades I'll tell you that I had some
fairly unstoppable upgrades yeah but you
know what I'm gonna say that was an
anti-climax cuz you don't even know the
fucking game was over I didn't know that
was an embossed Hey yeah that's problem
huh a little bit of a problem a little
bit of a problem unless unless it's an
Isaac situation where now that that end
boss is beaten I have to beat that
emboss and go to another and battle one
and boss an FTL we thought you would
never fucking conquer that thing yeah
yeah yeah difference different jokes all
right all right
different jokes told you guys to just
get through the Rustom so yeah that's
the tip so let's just hang out anonymous
says I'm not reading that and no I said
no means no god damn it and none of us
says it's true what's the deal with the
raccoon sweater and why haven't we seen
it in ages did it get lost
the raccoon sweater is kind of amazing
and it's still around hmm I did like the
game I do like this game I think it's
especially for the price I got by the
way which was you know three games for
five bucks including this this is this
is a really fun roguelike first-person
shooter except for the fact that it's
about magicians but in your head just
take that wand away and replace it with
a gun and you're fine
maybe you don't mind magician I'm sorry
for me for me I'm not a big magician
person but uh I'm kind of with you when
it comes to magicians even but yeah it's
a people doing at a wand so I in my head
they're just different guns
so shirt foxes hello I would like to
request a ban on myself for cheating at
bookworm adventures last stream I used
an anagram unscrambler to find the words
stegasaurus I am deeply ashamed lol
Chuck my Fox I knew that I knew Peter I
absolutely knew that was going to have
yeah that's why I was you know I see
these big words in the chat and like
they might they might be isn't you know
in anagrams cuz I know you could do that
yeah at the same time I just can't go
ahead and accuse everyone of the chat a
fucking cheat or no okay look we have
new game modes by the way now that we've
beaten the regular yeah we have new game
modes so for what it's worth I am NOT
surprised but I had to get people to
benefit him down and it's shame I think
it's actually a crying shame that we
can't just play and have a nice fun
bookworm that love somebody ruining it
somebody why don't you come in what what
is it by the way this is and and this is
something I know people are just trying
to get to the bottom of this like in the
in the cheater community yeah
like especially for online games was
just like what do you gain from this
cheaters
is it is it do you gain the the small
moment that someone says that that
you're better that you're smarter that
you're stronger until you realize that
you've just cheated mm-hmm what do you
gain from cheating I am Chester says is
sad that the body replaces all it sells
every seven years does this mean that
there are versions of ourselves that die
without even being aware of it
horrifying well have a nice day
yes that's horrifying but the question
is what is really you is it is it the
cells or is it the pattern which is you
really and maybe it's a little bit of
both and that's why that's what we call
character growth like getting older
getting wiser maybe that's just your
younger self dying how about how about
maybe that has nothing to do with your
pattern about you you invent some some
nanites okay that can perform a lot of
the functions of your body cells okay
and then you know over the course of
seven years you are slowly replaced with
nanites now you would notice no change
but at some point at the end of seven
years you would be a robot
or maybe an immortal badass robot you
would notice changes right and at the
end of the seven years like you grow
older and like oh I'm a little cower now
but then the seven years from then when
all of your peers have grown older you
haven't because maybe the cellular
change is part of the whole change of
the whole and it would be a badass robot
your brain doesn't get replaced rich I
just know I'm saying I take your brain
cells don't though don't they have to
well they don't know I mean no they
don't think you know nerves they don't
grow back together like you know that's
why by getting your spine severed it's a
big deal sure but I
this fluids being exchanged you know
they might be the same cells they might
not have the same atoms necessarily oh
shit oh shit
that's true about apple cheese fries you
are correct you are correct certain
brain cells according to mr McGrath do
regenerate just not all of them some
blue guy in chat says do you think
eventually will reach market saturation
with roguelikes
also I missed you reading my tip about
quake champions so would you mind
repeating what you said in response to
it I'm not a multiplayer guy so I'm not
like super enthused about it I mean I'm
glad for you and I have and I am a
multiplayer guy but I have no love of
the quake series so I'm also not super
enthused about it and okay finish moans
oh I was just gonna move on was there's
an exponent in regards if you mentioned
anything about quick one and somebody
asked about quake 1 & 2 - I don't know
if that was also you but when quake 1
came out my computer wasn't up to snuff
so I'd played that much quake 1 I played
it a little bit like when I was older
and had a better computer but I didn't
play the fuck out of quake 2 when that
came out because by the time that came
out I did have a new PC ok I believe was
a graduation present on high school he
was a wonderful wonderful time of quake
- yeah thoughts up 3 that was the
multiplayer focus quake I didn't really
play that and I actually liked for it's
the doom 3 engine without the spooky
shooter aspect oh ok yeah that's fun
it's fun right that's that's work Mo's
the other part of his - like a beginning
part is there
I want to say Oh market saturation with
roguelikes no no well of every game that
comes out as a roguelike then yes but it
but it was not it won't be yet it won't
be and you know what it just doesn't
like you can say like have we reached a
market saturation of 2d indie
platformers yet I'm sure there will be a
2d indie platformer that is so good that
everyone will love it right we've had a
market saturation of 2d indie platforms
and then owl boy came out and everyone
blew their shit over it was adorable
adorable a good game will always
supersede markets aperture H when
bumper-to-bumper she would do pushy
Batian so and that's what I was looking
up I've made a horrible mistake we have
our new stream deck here that we were
getting set up and it has a lot of
really fun buttons on it yeah
and in messing around with that I did
not turn on the Twatter
I'm sorry yeah you should be so we're
gonna have to do the old the old what is
it exclamation point subs yeah I've made
a horrible mistake that we are not done
