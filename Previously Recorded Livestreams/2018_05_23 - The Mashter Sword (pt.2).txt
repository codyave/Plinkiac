but Jack had never hate watch Supergirl
and the flash before he of legitimately
enjoyed these things no I still do

Friday 13th oh man
you're welcome you did it by Joe is a
fruit I'm an uncultured swine and I'm
not familiar with it pronounced feat Joe
up okay
sure why not
which did you see the Bohemian Rhapsody
trailer for what the they do one for the
freddie mercury biopic no no there's a
Freddie Mercury but I was thinking that
was like one of the Suicide Squad
trailers oh the trailer the trailer with
Bohemian Rhapsody right right right
of course obviously no I haven't the I
have not seen the trailer the rumor I've
heard and I don't know if this is true
but the rumor I've heard regarding
Bohemian Rhapsody is they they will not
be mentioning his particular sexual
preferences or AIDS why not
in the freddie mercury biopic why not I
don't know this is just a rumor I've
heard it seem to be big aspects of his
story it's kind of like what like a big
part of his life and you know why he
died so young and yeah looks like a
biopic of Jimmy Hoffa without any
mention of the disappearance and then
Jimmy Hoffa walked down his front door
credits yeah and I don't know if that's
true if Chad I don't know if chat can
can confirm or deny
find another way to hack through them
okay
the other members of Queen wanted a
g-rated biopic and have mercury die
halfway through and the rest of the
movie be about them getting on without
him oh you know what you just wait to
the other members of Queen die and then
you and then you make up the rapper
biopic absolutely that's exactly what
you do interesting but be like that the
doors wanting you know Jim Morrison not
to play too heavy a role and the doors
biopic you know no Val can just you know
cut some of his lines down can we just
ease up on the whole Jim Morrison yeah
is that something we can do cuz like
really get over it right am i right
what no I'm not telling the remaining
members of the Queen to die I'm just
saying you wait for that to happen two
very different things exactly
we're not wishing harm on anyone we're
just saying event people die people die
and you just wait
no gendered toggle in the Queen movie Oh
fucking get over it that might have been
a joke okay you're right that might have
been I might have been a joke that might
not have been mean-spirited people get
seriously bent out of shape over this
trip I can't I like I I I'm not naive
like when I say I can't understand why
people would be upset about Ave in
Battletech yeah cuz I don't like the
dumbest thing in the world cuz you just
don't use that look so right well it's
like I get why people are understand
upset because they're idiots and there's
you know they're you're being different
or you're placating to whatever but it's
just like yeah why did I don't get it
cuz why does it affect you
but you're right that totally could have
been sarcasm yeah yeah it's hard to tell
with text and and by the way chat it is
very hard to tell when you're when
you're trying to get in on the joke with
us and when you're being a total
dickhead so heads up you know cuz
everybody likes to joke and everybody
likes to you know do that but it's
sometimes it's difficult for us to know
do you do you super super super and I
can catch you down there
I gotta find I gotta find the super
weapon rich that is my job right now
there's a super weapon that will defeat
vines
Oh any idea any idea where the super
weapon is guys Jack
I I had a game of this is this a while
it was a long time ago now okay but I
did really good in a round of Friday the
13th once okay I had absolutely kicked
ass and dominated and afterwards yeah in
the lobby in the voice chat yeah the
people who was upset at me started
lecturing me on gender politics like
like like because because I won I was
the enemy obviously that meant I was an
sjw and even though I had did nothing
but play the game good I beat him and
he's lecturing me how reverse racism is
a thing it was the most surreal thing
this really had really happened I would
have did you you know let people still
be racist right you know that I'm like
I'm just sitting there thinking what the
fuck
like like you didn't make it like a joke
Jason but it was no it was just because
he didn't like me this meant obviously
I'm an sjw well yeah and so when I read
something in the chat this is one I'm
not sure if it's sarcasm or not sure
sure true that I'm with you I'm
absolutely with you man people are
messed up Wow rich still plays Friday 13
oh this happened this happened like a
year ago there's a while ago now sure
the end and by the way speaking of
Friday the 13th I I have been getting
all of your messages about the the
single-player campaign being being
almost ready
and I know that I know that the
single-player campaign is gonna be ready
soon come on it's - you're super I don't
know if we're gonna play it though just
because we haven't been playing I guess
Richard you know sometimes people just
got shit to say and you were the one who
was listening right that's that must
have been bubbling up for a long time I
don't I don't think it was circus
because he was like screaming right it's
just like what were you doing before
before the game man to get to get your
panties all in a knickertwist man just
but hey
Forrest what your toe hurts you need
advice uh you can you can try and buy a
nice foot massager one of those for like
hot-hot foot spa things that might help
but might not yeah I mean the toes
that's all there's a lot one toes you
ever have ever had an ingrown toenail oh
sure oh that's the worst it's the worst
when you have an ingrown toenail it
seems like everybody wants to step on
your toe oh yeah and it gets caught on
everything your toes suddenly just
becomes a magnet for all the things yeah
I'm with you
come on
I still haven't found the mega-weapon
that I'll get me through the vines
and that's very upsetting to me
great we did it
we did it we did it you're amazing jack
I feel amazing
Jack boomerang where yes I know I know
oh I found it I found it you know I
gotta say I do like that tunic that blue
swash that scarf thing oh this this
simple detail but it adds so much it's
you know the capes man they're super
powerful you know they're and it's it's
just a comic book thing meant to show
movement yeah that's the only reason
capes superheroes have capes and so they
could draw like movement for heroes and
that have a greater sense like the same
with uh that makes some sense same with
what do you would eat like trench coats
in old detective stuff they gave him
trench coats so when they were running
the trench coat could fly behind him and
everyone would know their movement right
that makes sense yeah and it's the same
for this that blue thing dangling behind
them it's nice it's real nice man
that should be an outfit and breath of
the bomb whoa someone's modded it
already I'm sure I haven't seen it if
they have I wouldn't mind this outfit in
breath in the wild I'd be done with that
the scarf is pretty baller I know the
shield is been martyred in one that
shield this shield yeah okay now this
stuff is pretty cool I don't hate it I I
do I just in general at least in breath
of the wild I I do prefer the the heroes
garb Oh Lady settle down jack is 100%
wrong about the purpose of capes on
superheroes it's probably a joke this is
an incredible stroke but I want to get
over there you have to do it as you have
the most it's probably oh yeah I'm gonna
I'm gonna pause it real quick I got a
I want to see with this I want to see
what this imager link is there's my
mouse now oh god it's like a manga shit
I wasn't even a good joke all right back
to it back to it
okay big monster time montón de la Mer
true-blue review says in here hey guys I
went to see Deadpool - and thought it
was pretty good and maybe better than
the original however not only did the
audience clap at the introduction of a
character but they also clapped at the
trailers specifically for solo and
ant-man - oh you can clap for trailer
you know what I'm okay with clapping for
a trailer yeah clapping it's something
stupid load during the movie but you're
okay with clapping for trailers it's
just a trailer you don't go to the movie
to see the trailer that's something that
happens before the movie hmm
before the movie you can even have your
phone out and dick around I don't give a
shit
during trailers oh no that's that's to
me that's the start of it that's the
start of the theater experience the
trailer yeah yeah you got to put that
you get as soon as the lights go down
that shit goes away okay okay
I'm not I'm not giving any I'm not
giving an inch when it comes to phones
and movies but shits out too much as it
is
there is the iron deku the man handler
that decker was totally metal whoa
motherfucker all right you know what I'm
leaving
now fuck fuck fuck
there we go
fuck
okay how's that there we go
get back here you dink
ah here we go there we go I was like I'm
doing the thing right there little
Bowlby mouths usually like blue colored
and dinosaurs all right that's what
that's at what I'm gonna call they're
they doing their own thing feed me see
wool a little shop of horrors I know
it's a great movie yes yes it is you
ever seen the original ending um I don't
know if that ever made it unto any of
the floating around bootleg for a while
okay the plants take over the world
Seymour gets eaten Audrey gets eaten and
the plants take over the world
this there's literally footage of of
giant plants rampaging like through the
Manhattan streets oh yeah yeah oh that's
great that is actually great
it's on the anniversary blu-ray okay
well that's good it needs to be
somewhere there you go
the original is better I've I've never
seen the Roger Corman Little Shop of
Horrors and I don't know how that one
ends hmm I don't know if I've seen it
either
to be honest
Earth's
speaking of Little Shop of Horrors Rick
Moranis is supposedly returning to
acting as kids I'm assuming are all
grown by now yeah wasn't wasn't that his
whole point for stepping back and just
wanted to spend time with his family
after his wife died yeah yeah no yeah
totally righteous reasoning good man
that Rick Moranis absolutely
why are they glowing silver they are
they are the they are a side mission
okay shit and I'm getting my ass handed
to me
and so I think if I can defeat them
I defeat beside mission san but or I die
or I die and I don't do anything I'm
pretty sure he never really left Rick
Moranis yes yeah he's he's a but what is
he coming back for he's coming back for
something something big
yeah Spaceballs to Spaceballs to wait
are they actually doing space bolster is
that it I think that's it
is that it I've heard nothing about a
Spaceballs - people are saying sctv
reunion knows that it
now that was fake balls - you can't he
came back just after Ghostbusters yep
whole is frickin knob no Brookes old
does that help last time I saw him
interviewed he seemed like he was in
really good health though oh he's still
with it but he's old oh yes they they
don't get much older than huh Brooks
like he's old enough now that his oldest
man in the world sketch makes sense 2000
year old man that was a a man uh Rob
Reider yeah
that's what I'm just thinking could you
get a ninety-year-old back to do a movie
bring in Spaceballs - I don't know if
he's acting anymore Mel Brooks right
making shit but I don't know if he's
acting Carl Reiner not rob yeah oh did I
say rob yeah and I agreed with you so I
am equally wrong great Oh a Reiner one
of one of them right father and son it's
close enough
one of them writers
do your fireball thing
true blue review I see your tip and
while I think there's nothing wrong with
it I'm just I'm gonna make a conscious
choice to steer the conversation
elsewhere angus is wise you know rich
these are the calls that we have to make
some steps but thank you
just remember that George Miller made
Mad Max fury road in his 70s
yeah but Mel Brooks is in his 90s
there's a 20-year difference there oh
yeah not and and we're not saying that
Mel Brooks can't do it he's just very
old man but he is an old man of very
good health dining up yeah generally
speaking he seems to be with it
mo Brooks killed actual Nazis was was
Brooks a veteran excellent question it
is an excellent question as an excellent
question well Christopher Lee he killed
Nazis mm-hmm I never really thought
about it I guess it makes sense but yeah
I never I mean I never pictured him as a
soldier Mel Brooks right my dad makes
sense
I'm killing actual Nazis that gives you
just bonus points in life
absolutely absolutely that's like free
breakfast - any time
no Chad I have not played Daisy but I
have heard there's a new dead state game
coming out a new dead state game yeah I
don't necessarily know what that means
dead state was a downloadable game I
think it sounds steam now too but I
think originally was just on the Xbox
360 and it was kind of like an
open-world zombie survival thing okay
and something something something felt
missing if they'll just shy of a
complete experience but there was
something there okay
I might be thinking of state of decay it
sure is a dead state hold on
important questions I have an Internet
machine in front of me you do figure it
out oh yeah that stated state of decay
that was called dead state I seriously
did it stated to Kate state of decay -
who's coming out well there you go I
think any kids who are like really into
breath of the wild and then play this
Godin got very uh got a little I got a
little culture shock with this lady and
her and her extreme boobage that's fine
oh it's fine I guess you see like oh
another adventure of Zelda or another
adventure of link aha aha mana what was
that word we're using before fanservice
Oh chat it's it's only the Mandela
effect if I think I came from an
alternate universe where the game was
actually called dead state otherwise
it's just faulty memory which is what
I'm going with far more likely yeah it's
far more likely that then I came from an
alternate dimension where it was called
dead state hmm
oh here I think we're we're good and oh
yeah look here's the different
dimensions there's Twilight there's
Skyward Sword now we're getting into the
different dimensions don't start with
that Mandela effect bullshit look that
Mandela effect bullshit is fun bullshit
it's fun bullshit it's it's silly it's
very very silly is what it is
can I ask is it common for anybody to a
thought that Mandela died in prison he
was on TV a lot growing up in the 90s he
was that doesn't change the fact that
some people claim to remember otherwise
and obviously their misremembering but I
guess I guess believing you're from an
alternate dimension and you cross over
at some point without knowing it's
better than admitting you're just a
idiot who couldn't watch the news
throughout the entirety of the 90s I
definitely remember that that's great
those orbs hit her right in the fan
surface yeah no I can't be wrong I must
be jumping for reality's a small Radko
right like I I love the idea of someone
just being so stubborn
that they're they're so unwilling to
admit any sort of fault that's great
okay okay kind of book okay great great
great
all the things
no I'm perfectly fine to admit when I'm
wrong man slew cuz I know I'm wrong
often times but I've I don't think I've
ever admitted that often I don't think
I've ever admitted or I've ever said
that I'm from an alternate universe
where I'm right all the time say things
that are wrong all the time that's of
two very different things
oh we're definitely going a Twilight
field then we can get midna Oh guys you
get the choose where you go you can't
bring any character in any map they have
a little security have mid though there
is an option they have free mode or you
can just play any character okay then
there's a adventure mode which is really
neat and that's just kind of like little
adventure mode and challenge modes are
basically just like little challenges
okay so yeah you can do some of that I'm
doing the story mode okay and so here
like it tells you like like in this in
this if I go to the sky loft I can play
as link if I go to Twilight field I can
play as whatever her name is and booklet
my guess is if I go I'm hoping if I go
here i unlock Midna to play in the next
one that's that's my hope but here this
is just where everyone's weapons are
what the heck is that egg Oh Agatha
classic
okay we got some some badges you know
I'll upgrade stuff okay see now here's
all your attacks rich and I know this is
where were you get really excited of the
vast amount of combos okay you see you
can either do ÿÿÿ ÿÿÿ or Y X or Y y X or
Y by Y X that's what I just unlocked
okay so that's pretty exciting
pretty excited about that where's the
thing it doesn't feel like combos
matters like no matter what you do your
swing your sword and a large 360 degree
arc that knocks over everything so it
seems like the combos are just kind of
meaningless flare is it's yes okay but
it's fun okay it's fun flais I don't
fault anybody for liking this yeah I'm
just saying for me I think there's a I
would have gotten tired of this an hour
ago oh sure
absolutely and and I hear that
this for every single one of them I do
for every single wad character yeah for
every single character I have to go like
go to their attack bags do you know I'm
sorry I'm sorry that the world is not
fair I really love the dynamic of
shitting on things that Jack likes and
Jack being completely okay with it it's
gone the other way Jack if you'll
remember was not very fond of XCOM - I
was ok with XCOM - okay just uh I was
not very fond of God of War that was
something that I shit on that you
enjoyed quite a bit and I I've been okay
with it because we we're adults weird
and rich and I have different tastes and
like knowing that rich doesn't like this
doesn't wreck my enjoyment of it I'm
still having a great time playing it
that's how taste works you know yeah and
I'm gonna be ok with that when when we
have our battle tech review my guess is
rich and I are gonna disagree on a lot
of things a lot of things about battle
tech as I'm not having a very good time
playing it at all and that's okay just
in case we get to play as me no let's
upgrade some of her stuff great
great or of the chosen is schlocky
nonsense um I think I think I've said
elsewhere that the worst part about war
the chosen is giving the enemies a voice
yes you have you have been very vocal
but vocal about that I I agree with you
on that
yeah I think you've also you've openly
started like even though it's the UH
cast a Star Trek The Next Generation
it's just not good right oh it was a
certain voice anything remember was the
voice and Worf was the was it was it
Michael Dora was just somebody doing
that style
no wait Michael Worf was one of the
people yeah yeah yeah right and Jonathan
Frakes right I don't even remember I
think it was Marina Sirtis
yeah and I think I think it was Maria
certains Michael Dorn and Jonathan
Frakes oh yeah you're right it was
freaks
I didn't even remember that aspect
cuz you hated the voices not the voices
themselves just the dialogue I think
XCOM didn't need that that that level of
schlock yeah who else was in it the
Frakes and cue
he was the psychic guy oh okay well they
yeah there you go there you go I
complete like my brain just completely
forgot about that it's weird that is
weird
we need the push for a beyond belief
revival with Frakes I'd be down with
that I'd be down with that you ever
watched beyond belief
No fact or fiction I was it was one of
those horrible Fox shows hosted by
Jonathan Frakes okay each week there
would be like three or four supernatural
stories and some of them were fake
but others other of these supernatural
stories Jack were true oh and then you
had to figure out which of the
supernatural stories they talked about
were fake and which of the supernatural
they stories they talked about were true
wait a minute is the easiest show ever
yeah those those back in the days when
Fox was doing like alien autopsy oh yeah
I think alien autopsy specifically would
spawn beyond belief oh yeah yeah an
autopsy was pretty dang far back in the
day yeah come back here
if you want chat if you want something
that's in the same style but but there's
like 90% less bullshit there was a show
on some cable cheap cable network it
wasn't a very expensive show might of it
like FX or something I don't really
remember but I think the show was called
dark matters and it's like every episode
it's like they had recreations she's
only done recreations of unethical
science experiments from the past really
yes interesting yes
into a dark matter dark dark matter is
like a sci-fi channel show Dark Matters
twisted but true it might have been on
sci-fi I don't remember I don't remember
what channel came on but it's really
that shirt the show is so fucking cheap
huh and the actors they get for the
recreations oh it is so amazingly cheesy
but it's good stuff okay all right I'm
down
like unethical or weird science I can
think there was a segment on this one
guy who famously tried to measure
somebody way somebody when they died so
they could figure out how much the soul
wait oh really that's a real thing
that's that's incredible he would he
would get dying people and and he would
have like the deathbed was like some
fancy scale and he would wait for them
to die and he wanted to see how the
weight changed on the corpse and that
was how that was how much a soul weighed
I love it I love it right that's great
that's just crazy enough to be weird
yeah I'm with you that is that's
absolutely crazy
I officially approve I officially you
know why I officially prove is because
that actually is a little scientific
know what someone's actual science shed
well I mean it's that is actual science
like I want to see if there is a soul
and so like let's weigh it obviously you
know there's other ways to prove that
but I I love that he applied the
scientific method to to absolute
nonsense that's great that's absolutely
great
doudou I don't remember I don't remember
this is on that show or not but there
was something else it was another kind
of weird weird science thing where there
was some kind of medical affliction
going on some kind of epidemic and this
one doctor was convinced it wasn't a
disease it was something dietary there's
like people weren't getting enough fruit
because they changed something but like
the corn and like people weren't getting
the right vitamins it was a dietary
deficiency okay okay and I think they
tried to prove it was it a germ was like
they took somebody who had this
affliction and they just like they would
literally do whatever to get and try to
get infected from him like like they
take some of a spit and like take a swab
swab it around their mouth and whatever
they could trying to get an infection
yeah yeah and then when they don't get
infection and infection that was there
like proof that look this isn't an
infection yeah yeah this is something
dietary and I think I think that was
another segment on dark matter all right
I like it and so it was like this whole
party they had we're like eating little
chunks of this guy's you know what just
whatever they could think of try and get
all the people at this party infected
with this epidemic to prove that they
couldn't get infected because right
right that's great
shit rich
I was the dark summoner
okay
that must be the green one
all right what's going on I gotta find
the dark summoner and defeat the dark
summoner okay is the dark summoner
making the things from the different
Zelda games appear I don't know I was
flying lizards from Twilight Princess
those are great I don't know why you
didn't fight more of them
those were fun fights in Twilight
Princess sure no no I like I just gave
up on Twilight Princess so early on I
didn't I didn't have it in me there is I
didn't have it in me to defeat to finish
a Skyward Sword mm-hmm oh you never
finished it no no I didn't get very far
at all I finished it I was just
underwhelmed
sure
speaking of weird science thoughts on
angle blingo uh their song weird science
is great
waggle BIOS angle angle is great you
have any thoughts on lingo blingo
they're great for anybody who doesn't
know it was Danny Elfman's band yeah
back in the 80s
I'm cool with I go boy go for anyone who
doesn't know Danny Elfman is a famous
composer I assume all the kids know the
kids know who Danny Elfman is Skyward
Sword is the worst zelda are we talking
3d I think we are I don't I don't think
it's that bad but I I don't think the
game is that bad but it might be the
worst zelda 3d yeah I say 3ds I haven't
played a lot of the 2d ones that are on
like the handhelds oh man those are
fantastic I haven't played like the
Oracle game sure and those are fantastic
I I I will hear no ill talk about those
games because I think they're great I
know you haven't played a lot of them
you would actually probably really like
a lot of them because I know you are a
fan of Link to the Past
yeah so you would actually probably
really in trouble probably one I
probably would I just I didn't really
have her use handhelds back in that shit
was coming out right right
get Fez fleeing why is that that fleeing
dang it gosh dang it I get that where
are you for for the people who don't
like Twilight Princess I know I know I
used to be all up that games ass yeah I
replayed it like what like a year ago
now maybe less okay
I didn't like it near as much yeah yeah
yeah I'm with you i i I think it I loved
it at the time I absolutely loved it at
the time but it has a lot of problems I
I do suggest that maybe maybe you'd find
it more enjoyable anybody who hates it
if you actually played the GameCube
version that doesn't have the motion
controls oh and I actually like the
motion controls yep yeah I thought the
motion controls were a strong point of
the game it's just so front loaded with
all that bullshit every time you're a
wolf it's bullshit so motion controls
are so annoying in Skyward Sword because
that shit always needed to be
recalibrated I get a couple swings and
then suddenly his legs holding his sword
behind his back trying to trying to wipe
his own ass and you got to recalibrate
and five was obnoxious
the talking sword woman yeah yeah she
was I'm coming I'm coming
where are you miss ladypants there you
are
yeah there was just a lot there's a lot
not to like you know like I said I
didn't even I did not finish it I didn't
get very far because I because I just
like so much of it that's my opinion on
winwaker it's up there might be the
second best 3d Zelda uh yeah yeah I'd
give you that I'd give you that after
breath of the wild yeah yeah yeah I'd
have to add absolutely give you that no
doubt no diggity this is this is just 3d
ones because we're talking 2d I haven't
played them all
and honestly link to the passes up there
it's really up there but 3d ones
brethren the whelmed winwaker and now
I'm not sure what I put third anymore
that used to be Twilight Princess and
I'm not sure after the last time I
replayed it and that was super
underwhelmed the dog dog link is really
weak dog League sucks yeah yeah after
after you get done with all that stuff
and you can just roam around as normal
link it's pretty dang good it combats so
bad how I actually I liked a lot of the
combat man yeah love the inner there's
good dodge roles Perry's like there were
I thought the kind of that was pretty
pretty pretty nice don't thing to combat
a lot of the 3d Zelda's a little bit
lackluster the other the other good the
other good thing about Twilight Princess
and I'm not disagreeing that it's not
third is is Midna herself I fell in love
with mitten as a character
she's fine I absolutely character yeah I
loved her she's she's she's the best out
of Lynx sidekicks yes
favorite shit
uh yeah she's just the best
she's just just the best I I had I had
many I had many emotions at the end of
Twilight Princess when when it was the
time for emotions to be had
so that's a strong point but man is that
a slow start if you were if you replay
Twilight Princess now it is a slow dang
start and so many cutscenes so much
malarkey should probably replay winwaker
because i cannot for the life of me
understand why everyone loves it so much
but it just feels like middle of the
road zelda what is what is winwaker have
going for it's got some good dungeons
from what i remember
it's got not only good dungeons but Wind
Waker has real exploration I I dug the
shit out of all of the audible and I
know like that's the part people hate
the most is this there was a whole lot
of sailing yeah and a lot of the the
hugeness of the world is an illusion
generated by the amount of sailing you
do yes but typically there was at least
something at least one interesting thing
to discover in each and every little
segment of the map yes one one weird
kooky Island that had something
interesting about it or some neat item
you could find and or some kind of
wrecked ship that had treasures you get
when you fight it was something
interesting in every sector yes and it
really felt like you were discovering
them like like I everybody shit on the
sailing everybody's good on sailing and
I could just sail around all day I lit
it felt like a fully realized world
where you know like it had its little
you know the the beetle on his little
boat that you'd come across the male
character carriers you you I I'm
agreeing with you but you can admit
right that a lot of the epicness of the
wind waker world is an illusion
generated by the vast amounts of just
emotion i yes okay and i and i hear that
point but i will gladly suspend my
disbelief okay it's it's easy enough for
me to just suspend it and go you know
it's good exploration good exploration
some good dungeons good dungeons really
good combat III like to combat I thought
I thought they it was simple and and on
points that whole the whole like when
their weapon glows you spin around him
to hit a make up mega blow attack was
it's it's a super ultimately it's a
superficial thing but the animation is
so good it looks beautiful the animation
is so amazing
yes and it's got one of the best tones
in the series windfall island yep yep
yeah also really excellent supporting
cast and little story I I love the start
of Wind Waker because they make it
personal right away it's not it's not
like you're you're the in Wind Waker
you're not like the hero of Destiny
who's fighting because it's destiny kind
of are no you the the start of Wind
Waker what are you doing that's started
every zelda your humble except for
except for breath of the while know the
the very first mission of Wind Waker is
you're just rescuing your sister yeah
okay like that what that's what starts
you I mean sure yes you are it does it
does Morphin d you are the hero of
course but but the choice to go on the
adventure was it was a selfless act for
your sister okay and they set up her as
a character's personal so you were more
invested in the reasoning right off the
bat okay and then you know like oh I
just so happened to be the hero after
that great that's fine that's fine right
mmm
I loved it I loved the the the Deku leaf
gliding around that was beautiful last
year you said that winwaker had your
favorite link and possibly best in
Ganondorf which one Muir Jack cuz I love
the Wind Waker I I think I think my
favorite leg goes to breath of the wild
cuz they they sidestep the hero's
journey which I am kind of just sick up
at this point and they just flat-out say
you're a well-trained badass yeah when
you start the game you're not oh you're
a knight you
biggest badass and that's why they made
you the Royal protector because you're
just you're a good fighter yeah
and no I'm just starting from scratch
you know they've gotta go ahead hero's
journey breath well they just cut out
all the bullshit no you're you're great
yeah yeah I like the breath of the
wildling Wind Waker top Ganon top tier
gaming I might agree with you there yeah
yeah best Ganon winwaker yeah
yes that's the battlefield where's the
underdog element then you're you're a
badass in breathitt well but you're
fighting a like a god so there's still
there's still an underdog element to it
and you're fighting like an unstoppable
monster board that that revives
themselves every once in a while you're
still the underdog oh yeah oh yeah is
battling with higher row forces okay
shit I'm probably supposed to go over
there
there's my food
and I know you know we're talking a lot
of 3d Zelda right now because just
because rich hasn't played all the 2d
Zelda's but like there there are there's
a lot of good in in those two DS Zelda's
- there's a lot of fun stories my
favorite part of all those 2d Zelda is
just the puzzles yeah the the puzzles
and the dungeons in those games are are
the best
I'll see going back a little bit oh
another another reason you're still the
underdog and breadth of the wild is you
did already get your ass kicked
let's not forget with the backing of an
entire fucking army and magic robots and
spells and you the sword that seals away
the darkness yeah you still lost and now
you got to try again without any of that
shit Permian Hyrule anymore yeah yeah
that's actually like something I little
II keep loving about breath of the wild
is like you just you failed you're done
kid get out of town
what is it with nintendo games where you
fight the same villain over and over
again let's that's not just nintendo i
mean that's a lot of things GI Joe is
always fighting Cobra he man's always
fighting Skeletor so it's not just the
Tendo
and I got us I gotta say if you work
fighting Ganon I'm gonna be a little
like a lot of people work Twilight
Princess there's people who are upset
you don't fight Zant at the end legs ant
isn't the main villain how does that
samples kind of lame sans the big guy
with the gecko head that jumped around
and made silly noises they're upset he
wasn't the final villain of Twilight
Princess oh they were upset there's
people who wanted him to be them they
were upset when Gannon showed up really
ya know I remember that game if I'd be
in a good fight too in Twilight Princess
yes no that's yeah that cuz that's one
like you get the light arrows yeah
there's some fun in that fight is there
anything look forward to the stream or
is it just this well if you your aren't
enjoying the game or our conversation
I'm sorry yeah then no no yeah your your
princess is in another castle
yeah sorry man we can't help you today
we just can't help you today I was upset
when Zant went from being a real villain
to a goofy-looking thing that jumped
around yeah I never I never liked his
look in the first place though I stuff
like that Gekko had was just kind of
stupid looking oh yeah as a personal
preference issue I guess yeah well like
it or not
Ganon is kind of the iconic villain in
the series mm-hmm and if he's not the
villain for better or worse it's gonna
feel like a side story like an offshoot
yeah I mean like a lot of the handheld
ones yes and you know they kind of are
offshoots which again I'm okay with but
Gannon literally becomes a pig I never I
was never a fan of full-on pig again and
I don't know why they never used pig
wizard again and pig wizard Ganon um pig
face but just kind of big bulky with a
robe like he looked like in the end of
the originals of 2d Zelda oh sure
monstrous but still humanoid I don't
know why they don't go back to that
again and for 3d but yeah like the final
form and breadth of the wild I hate that
gennym yeah yeah I'm with you
it's a terrible design and a terrible
fight but I think I think most people
will tell you that the Ganon fight in
breadth of the wilds kind of a letdown
I don't I don't think I don't think
that's a novel opinion to have
what about majora rich it's pretty
ominous I I'm like the one who hasn't
played Majora's Mask I'm the guy so I I
don't really have any experience with
majora
yeah I couldn't get through Majora's
Mask
that's what that's that's up on my list
of stuff that I want to replay and enjoy
just because I know everybody does but
but I haven't
not Flint
link between worlds I the handheld I
have haven't played it I haven't played
many I think the only handheld Zelda
I've played was Link's Awakening oh yeah
I think that's the only one that's an
old-school that's an hour i won
they were they were trying to cram a
whole lot into a small package with
Link's Awakening I just I'd never really
had handhelds it's not something I
sought out
yeah I've played all all the handhelds
and and loves uh I mean maybe all of
them they're just adorable
they're just adorable no this way
favorite Zelda weapon from any game you
mean I'm assuming you don't mean
favorite weapon that Zelda has use but
just favorite weapon in the Legend of
Zelda series um I'm gonna be really
fucking boring and you're gonna hate me
for it I'm just gonna say the Master
Sword is because it is you know that's
just my honest answer that's and I think
that's fair that's solely fair I know
it's boring
but that's my honest answer it is boring
but you know we'll take honesty rich
will take honesty here that said yeah I
wish they used it more but the in
Twilight Princess oh I love the double
hook shot navigating with the double
hook shot yeah this is fucking great
agreed
super agreed
super agreed that was great in in
windwaker that of the giant skull hammer
that you get and obviously you know me
and hammers yeah I know but I thought it
was awesome I thought it was awesome you
know cuz it's obviously you know like
one of those weapons were it has a use
outside of combat but you can also use
it come bat if you wanted I love that
love that skull hammer
the spinner would have worked better as
a single dungeon gimmick than a
full-blown item yeah there probably
would have oh this look it's not like
they use that damn thing outside of that
one dungeon anyway yeah
No and that's that's one of them that's
one of Twilight princesses and a lot of
the zone this is one of the weaknesses
then the fun items are useless outside
of their dungeon yeah yeah except for
breath of the wild oh yeah that's the
benefit of just giving you all of the
items right order right from the get-go
yeah they don't fuck around here's your
bombs if you had to earn those for
various like divine beast then they
couldn't guarantee it hadn't when you
were over here and so they wouldn't use
it over there but by just giving you all
of the the items that's not what they
call them what do they call them the
applications the ancient your freaking
sheikah slate apps yeah your apps by
just giving them to you from the start
you could sidestep all that shit and
just design the whole game knowing that
the player already has all the shit yeah
and it's not an issue yep runes thank
you chat the runes we all know they're
sheikah slate apps though I like calling
the maps I like calling the maps because
then in in my mind at one point someone
had to like pay for them you know like
they're not free apps either supported
by ads I like that idea
great we're doing great here guys I feel
like like we're making good progress
maps all blue
