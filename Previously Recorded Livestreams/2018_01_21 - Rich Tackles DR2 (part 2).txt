mmm-hmm okay so now is the point in the
stream in which I'm going to talk about
Star Wars okay what do you have to say
about Star Wars so a topic that's been
discussed so much I want to throw up
when I hear the name star followed by
Wars III get you and by the way the
angry the anger I've received on Twitter
after some mild some mild Star Wars
comments makes me be there right with
you it's never worth it to talk about
Star Wars it's never worth it someone
tweeted at me the other day about how
many days I thought took place in the
force awakens okay they said you know
like I'm thinking about now and it kind
of felt like it took place over one day
yeah and I was like and you know I
started thinking about that and you know
it starts at night with the massacre and
then we got the next day with Ray
scavenging and then we have another
night scene and then we go the next day
but probably you know that third day is
like there on the Falcon there on the
other ship they go like that's a long
day but we there maybe there's another
night day and there so I'm gonna say
we're talking about a 24 hour human day
right human we have to assume we have to
assume that they they followed the same
basic clock as we do right the human
okay okay
space days if you will 24 hour space
days and so I'm assuming the force
awakens took place three over three or
four days and so I started thinking
about well no it starts at night well
you go to different planets you can't
judge it by the day at night
well no I'm jakku it starts at night
yeah then the next day on jakku she's
scavenging okay and then remember she's
sitting at the 8080 at night before the
action really starts right then they
leave the planet and that might be all
one same day for sure we have three days
okay after that I'm saying maybe for
right
like some kind of weird eight-hour day
exactly right there's a there's a lot of
variables and yes yeah I'm making a lot
of assumptions it's every planet's a 24
hours every planet has a party of course
yeah jakku is the opening scene that's
where they killed the old man
that's why bb-8 ended up on jakku and
found ray a 24 hour day and and
precisely one environment yes
desert desert or spaceship of some
varying degrees
they really mixed it up with return when
they added a jungle to the mix okay so
then I started thinking about the
original series and I had a little time
on my hands and so I actually like you
know I popped open the original series
and started scrubbing through them to
figure out how many days took place in
the original series and in a new hope
it's actually four days you know
something interesting about Star Wars
and time in a new hope I thought this
was very interesting so we have a couple
days on what's Luke's home planet we
have a couple days on Tatooine but then
on the third day is when they go when
they go to the the most Eisley cantina
when they take off with han Solo but
then you know when Luke's doing his
lightsaber training that's two in the
morning okay because the homme says we
should arrive at Alderaan at Oh 200
hours which means Han uses military time
okay which I thought was very strange
but like they're all doing that at 2:00
in the morning
on the fourth day on what would be the
fourth day and in Star Wars presuming Oh
two hundred means the same thing you
have to presume that man it's Star Wars
you probably would presume that because
it's Star Wars but yeah so that takes
place over four days and so then I start
going into Empire right yeah and using
only what's available in the movie and
that's the important part for you
fuckwads only information available in
the movie Empire takes place over five
days
which by the way New Hope's episode four
empires episode of five by the way we
get to return uh-huh
six days four five six four Episode four
five and six
uh-huh and that crazy I just thought it
was is it okay if I say no I just think
that's an incredible coincidence don't
you think yeah I think it's an
incredible coincidence I'm not oh god
I'm not saying they planned that out
Jesus Christ they'd couldn't plan
something out right I'm just saying what
an incredible coincidence and so I tweet
out something to that that variety yeah
you know for the episode for Forbes
right right right
so here's where I'm incredibly wrong
according to the internet rich yeah you
ready for it I'm ready for it the Empire
Strikes Back you know Luke goes to take
about a train and behind and Leia go to
Cloud City I understand
do you know how long that movie takes
place yeah three to four months what
that's that's what people on the
internet say is three to four month i
Empire oh you know why why they can't
handle that Luke didn't have that much
training that he had about five hours
worth of training and that's absolutely
the case he had five hours
no he's Undead above for giving it like
of like the full breadth of my
imagination
he's undead buff for three days Hannah
Hannah Malia weren't on on the run for
no fucking four months I fucking know
cuz they can't handle the Luke Skywalker
Jedi training he's amazing chale said
yes he turned out like Ray Ray learn
instantly not like that's exactly what
it is rich that's exactly what it
fucking is and they're so
determined to prove me wrong they're so
determined to prove me wrong about this
they're like well you know you know what
it was rich in the novelization they
explained that it indeed took Han and
Leia months to get to bespin but no it's
like in the movie they're there in a day
they're there in a day maybe two it
doesn't matter
Richi impersonation of the internet no
yeah so that's the point that's what
I've been dealing with is all these
nerds who are so hell-bent on proving
that Luke is a better Jedi because he
has all right oh and he didn't he
totally did not oh god no and clearly
the next time he sees Yoda and Jedi he
hasn't come back
based on their dialogue right right but
they're so hell-bent on proving their
points that they make up random bullshit
like I said according to the
novelization according to things that
aren't in the movie oh no yeah it was
months it took him he was training for
months right but there's nothing in the
movie that says that it was anything
like it there's nothing in the movie
that says han and Leia were in the
Falcon for anything more than a couple
hours they're in the exact same fucking
chair it's not a Mary Sue Luke's not a
very suit Luke's not a Mary Sue Luke's
not a very soon Luciana Maurice to
Luke's Lattimer so the girl is the
girl's the battle the girls the bad one
not Luke Luke is good and perfect all
the time it's the girl that's the bad
one right I understand by the way I
understand what you guys are all saying
though their hyperdrive was busted and
so you know logically it would take them
months to get to bespin the only problem
is that's not shown anywhere in the
movie they detach from the big cruiser
and they're all sitting in the cockpit
of the Falcon and they fly off - best
been cut - they're at best Ben's still
sitting in the cockpit all wearing the
same clothes and no time has passed if
they're not able to hit Lightspeed then
that journey took them tens of thousands
of years unless unless Bespin is of the
very same star system that I might have
only taken a year and why would they
think they could hide there in the same
star system
that they're fleeing from oh no it seems
that their logic is broke it's very soon
right so he had more than two days of
training he's not a Mary Sue he's the
best trained Jonathan it's because he
had so much training that's why because
he had so much training that's why
that's why he's not so that's it that's
all it was is over and over all weekend
is people just doing their best to prove
me wrong and they do just can't people
you absolutely cannot there there's a
case that Luke is on Dagobah for three
days I still think it might just be too
well two days of training he lands he
lands the one day the night okay and
then he's got one day of training where
he he's got Yoda on his back and he does
the flips and he goes to face you know
fake Vader in the cave and then he's got
day two of training where he's lifting
rocks and Yoda lifts the x-wing and then
he sees the vision of his friends and
then he leaves that night yeah he has
two days worth of training I've I've
always known this right the the Nerds on
the Internet do not do not believe my
favorite part is you know everyone
everyone points to this novelization
right all right well ants and so they
say you know like that's what don't you
understand that's why people are so
upset about ray because she didn't have
any training and to which case you can
just say oh well then just wait for the
novelization of a force awakens and I'm
sure they'll clear all that up you don't
even need that fucking kylo Ren is
bleeding to these cash out the kidney
and you don't even need that the space
wizards it's a fantasy movie I know it's
a fantasy movie like or not to think
about the entire franchise you're sure
you've brought this to my door jack I
did know it was brought
me by the Internet and I'm sharing it
with you because I have no one else
because you hate me because I have no
one else who will listen to me you're
forced to listen to me you're right here
and and I know it's entertaining for
everyone to watch you lose your shit
over Star Wars so that was more more so
rich that was a gift to our audience
you're welcome I thought I was gonna
talk about the new Star Wars movie not
the old one yeah we talked about that
one already not you know and I've only
seen it the once I've only seen oh no
I've seen Star Wars twice I've seen it
the twice now I've seen the Star Wars
the twice now I still likes it
jack is factually wrong Luke had a year
experience it's not a good buy for your
whole year
yes yes he he's with the rebellion for a
while I can't imagine he trained with
another Jedi Master for a year like you
know I got some pilot training sure
maybe some hand-to-hand combat training
Star Wars facts have you had training
cassettes do you think do you think the
the the Jedi books were like on tape he
was listening to tape and he was
listening to them while piloting the
x-wing then yeah that's possible that's
possible chapter 3 using the force and
that's how that's how I recorded these
in case I should ever die before I could
properly train you and that's how Luke
knew he could move the lightsaber and
Empire cuz no one ever taught him Luke
said to Mary Sue no one ever taught him
he could move stuff with his mind but he
just does it an empire and no one ever
taught him but he just does it rich how
does he know how to do that no one
taught it to him what a Mary Sue no wait
did he move stuff with his mind did
obi-wan ever move stuff with his mind I
don't think so I don't think so either
he violated people's free will right
right but did he ever move anything with
his mind
no Yoda did later remember Luke grabs
his lightsaber from the snow in the
beginning of empire yep
did he ever see that before I don't
think so actually
no before before he tried lifting his
work on Hoth look what's important yeah
is that Luke isn't a Mary Sue even
though he had just a slightly bit amount
of more of training than Rey who quite
clearly isn't Mary sure right Luke had a
whole 36 hours of training right and
will and all the boys on tape right
right remember if it didn't happen on
camera it cannot be suggested by a
storyteller there is a difference
between what people consider Star Wars
Canon and what happened in the movies if
if you're saying that people need to
read three novels a comic book and
excite l'épée dia of the universe in
order to understand the movie I'm gonna
call that a bad movie
ya see I think that's Manny the Vera
King makes many good points is he thinks
that the the novelization of the last
Jedi is really gonna flesh out the whole
Rose Finn love story I bet there were
chapters missing right so wait for the
novelization that'll just flash every
everything will make sense after that
let's go
is Jack talking about something he
doesn't like about the light here here's
the thing I like both Empire and the
last Jedi and I think that both of them
kind of have their flaws as all movies
do all of the Star Wars movies have some
flaws if you think about them for a
little bit but that's okay because
they're just fun movies and in in the
case of both movies you're their fantasy
movie so you're not really supposed to
be thinking hyper logically you're just
supposed to be enjoying the characters
and the situation that they're in it's
all fantasy it's all make-believe it's
all it's all magic and sorcery so if you
like the characters and the situations
that they're in that's the only thing
you're supposed to be worried about
no Star Wars no no work of fiction
should ever define you as a person and
if you find yourself passionately
and violently usually arguing with
someone over Star Wars you need to like
pause and just re-evaluate your life
it's it's fun you know like getting into
like nitpicky stuff in movies it's
supposed to be a fun thing that people
do like yeah that doesn't make any sense
that's really silly and in Star Wars
they got the Death Star they're right
and they're waiting to blow up a moon
but why not just blow up the planet that
would probably blow up the moon too
right why do they gotta get around the
planet that doesn't make no sense that's
a plot hole but you know what it doesn't
fucking matter because we're all just
excited about the battle all these
little things people all these little
things
I know I know you've said the I hate
everything videos aren't another
cinemasins but I'm very skeptical and
usually I forget to check into them
after the stream is over it sounds like
a channel that you know reflexively
hates everything because that's what
their name is so I have yet to lock on
to checking that channel out but I hear
you I hear you like that jimothy Robert
Deathstar
more like death Mary Sue star yeah that
stars America
what nipple bag I like to like a movie
you get out of town that's a fun little
movie nipple bags I said leg of movie
sucked
it was pretty alright tell you what I
think they nailed that
remember when you passionately argue
about a film the problem is me
well I'm hopefully entertaining people
that's part of what I'm doing here this
is part of the stick we'll talk about
movies oh the looters are back yeah
, bin says is it just me or have
trailers doubt and worse I think it's
just you I think it's just you I think
there's some really good trailers and
there's some not-so-good trailers and I
think that's always been the case
well his guard as long as I'm
entertaining people that's all that
matters as long as I'm entertaining
people all right
where are we
jay-ar our love grass is rich would you
and Mike consider doing some the
original series episode commentaries
both good and bad apps I asked because
old shows can be intimidating to younger
viewers and this might help get people
interested in Star Trek the original
series we'll see we usually we usually
don't do TV type commentaries but I know
it's not it's not been discussed before
tell you that how would that work
I guess it would work the same as any
commentary fair right yeah just like
start now yeah by nature they're shorter
though which might hurt time you get on
we usually go off on tangents though we
usually don't talk about what we're
watching it might actually be a terrible
idea
oh really just an excuse for you guys to
go on more tans
yeah and get more episodes out so that's
why more episodes out quicker so you
know it could be a good idea
all right well we got here valium
bloodshot who says I wish Marvel adapted
Garth penises Punisher max where he took
on real criminals the Mafia corrupted
military officials a human trafficking
ring employees of Enron it's bloody
twisted and glorious he typically takes
on real criminals right
I assume yeah I think when was the
Punisher created in the comics 75 75
originally a spider-man villain yeah
yeah I can see that I like to see them
the III think you're gonna have a
problem with the Punisher with
modern-day sensibilities Punisher if the
Punisher was created in the mid-70s you
are talking you know a height of you
know crime-ridden streets
you got you got New York being you know
filled with pimps oh yeah she wasn't
prostitutes this Deathwish time right
that's that's what the Punisher was born
out of yes this was a time when everyone
was just absolutely okay murdering
anyone who you know littered it should
almost be a period piece right right and
so just the very idea of a hero that
murder someone might not it doesn't it
doesn't mesh with modern sensibilities
which is why like in the Punisher series
in fact like that's one of the that's
one of the big things is like who he can
kill and why he's killing and his
internal struggle and that's kind of
what made the Punisher kind of mad is I
don't necessarily want to see the
internal struggle I want to see The
Punisher murder a bunch of people that's
his shtick yeah but yeah if you have a
show where he's the star you gotta put
you got to ride that no no it's fucking
fine you know you do you know you do you
introduce other characters yeah they
have some kind of story as new she's
going on and the Punisher is just the
the weird fuckin badass who gets
involved you do like a Mad Max type of
thing
sure there you go yeah yeah and then
whoever the villain is they have to be
the fucking worse the guest star for
that season or that episode who has an
arc throughout the season yeah teams up
with the Punisher or gets involved with
the Punisher who is just what he is
right I'm with you I think that's a fine
idea yeah
agree that that one guy wants Punisher
season two less backstory more violence
yes that's what I want under the
Punisher I agree I agree what I'm saying
is that's what I want out of the
Punisher but I can also see producers
being a little squeamish of making that
show okay okay what's your problem
I did yes that is absolutely no problem
right a black mark says that's why
daredevil worked so well or that's why a
Punisher works so well in daredevil
season two the story was about
Daredevils you know possible turn to the
dark side and the Punisher was already
there just doing his Punisher thing but
then we could you know we could moralize
with daredevil and the Punisher was just
there killing people I agree that is why
he worked so well in daredevil season
two until the end because my little mold
Stewart doing it that lady hey Jacko
there any shows on Netflix you'd
recommend off the top of your head
preferably stuff that's not too drama
based I don't necessarily know what
drama based means Stewart you dick oh I
have you seen dark it's kind of drama II
but it's it's a it's a good sci-fi
murder mystery something to watch on
Netflix recently
I'm gonna think well I'd like I want to
recommend broadchurch but that's pretty
drama based to broadchurch is a
detective show on Netflix oh there you
go
Kimmy Schmidt if you have not seen the
unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt pure comedy
pure delight
that one's great
what did I think of it defenders oh I
thought that sucked
I thought defenders sucked major voice
as someone who is a fan of Daredevil and
Jessica Jones and who thought that Luke
Cage worked well in Jessica Jones and
was pretty just ambivalent towards his
name fucking iron fist defenders do
something so fucking aggressive trying
to give you oh you have to keep him
alive while he's beating you to death
well he's joined me now I punched him a
few times and convinced them I have a
safe space he can go to yeah where the
zombies are trying to give him some
vodka take your vodka Stewart yeah I did
not enjoy the defenders at all I think
the people were playing against
character and he just didn't make any
sense and I didn't care about the story
the story was picking up where like iron
fist left off and no one cared about
iron fist and Elektra was there and who
cares about Elektra god I hated Elektra
and daredevil season two she started out
as a super interesting character and a
girl of mystery and power and just ended
up to be the lamest fucking thing have
you finished heard of his now she's just
she ends up being the lamest thing yeah
oh my god she starts off so strong and
then the entire defenders is wrapped up
with her and the hand and mystical
magical bullshit
oh sure but misty night does get her arm
ripped off so in Luke Cage season -
we're gonna get robot armed misty night
which is awesome big dumb I'm being so
dumb I should drink it right now drink
it do it don't be dumb why you saving it
for later just be relatively safe in
here and there's food in here okay so
the only cool thing to come out of
defenders is we get robot armed misty
night in Luke Cage season two and misty
night as far as I'm concerned was the
highlight of Luke Cage she needs her own
show I want a detective show with misty
night being a sassy ass motherfucker
now we're getting another season of Luke
Cage maybe they'll do better second
season I was crazy disappointed with the
first season but oh my god
nerds yes horrible stockyards yeah they
won't join you unless there's a girl in
your group really yeah really
oh my god that's i rolling that is i
rolling bad yeah it is yeah it is they
won't come with you unless you have a
girl you don't get the misty night love
in in Luke Cage we we are asked to care
about Harlem and its inhabitants even
though our protagonist just moved there
a couple of weeks ago and only knows one
dude but here's misty night someone who
grew up in the area has ties to people
in the community she is the person who
gives us a reason to care about the city
that Luke Cage is protecting that Luke
Cage God why would he have anything
connecting him to the city she's also
just a working detective I loved her
detective vision thing where you know
she would like kind of ghost walk
through the crime scene and try to
figure stuff out I enjoyed detective
shows and so I dug her as a character
you guys not joined yet hurry the fuck
up Oh Brittany needed to bend over first
just show them the goods cookies
I thought Luke Cage was from Harlem he
was just moving back after prison no
Luke Cage is from the south
Luke Cage grew up with his brother in
the south and only moved to Harlem after
prison because he was a cop in the south
and the only no he only moved to Harlem
recently after his wife died after the
events of Jessica Jones does he move to
Harlem so he has no real reason to like
be there or care about the people
besides just that he's a good guy
well yeah the barber was his dead wife's
uncle or the barber was like a friend
like a good friend of his dead wife
that's how he knew the barber and so the
barber was the connection but we lose
the barber pretty early I think there's
a lot of structure problems I feel like
with Luke Cage I just don't understand
why he wanted to be a hero I didn't get
it
someone says I don't care about Oz
because Dorothy didn't grow up there
except for the whole point of us was
Dorothy was getting out of Oz to go home
so first of all burn sick obviously
second of all Oz was discovering Oz was
part of the wonderment of the movie and
we never have that with Harlem in Luke
Cage it could yeah well that was you
know that was the the bad guys thing is
harlem's Renaissance is like we're
trying to build up Harlem into you know
the new Harlem and that may or may not
coincide with some gangsters who want to
keep Harlem the way it is because that's
how they run the business in Luke Cage
so so we should have had some of those
Wizard of Oz type moments with Harlem
where Luke was discovering the city and
why the city was worth saving his is
Luca Mary Sue
Luke is a Mary Sue also can't be a Mary
Sue he's a guy Jessica Jones is a Mary
Sue no Lou God of course Lucas Mary Sue
he's like that's true she's super strong
and she didn't know her strength at all
she's Marie soon I said well so did Luke
Cage he it was an accident
yeah did he have five minutes of
training he had no training oh my god he
has no training whatsoever
what I think of the Marvel TV format
doesn't work better than a movie to give
you 13 episodes it can it has it has
works good it's getting late
once again I was watching recently I was
watching a thing recently a television
show that felt like it was exactly like
two episodes too long and I forget what
it was yeah Oh barely no god damn it but
I I know they like to stick to the 13
episode format but you know if you don't
got it you don't got it I wonder if
that's dictated by Netflix or or if
that's something that show's creators
choose but there was something I was
watching recently that was exactly like
an episode and a half too long
I just wanted it to be a little bit
shorter oh you can do it it's freezes on
be medicine up there
I believe you were talking about
stranger things - oh maybe that was it
stranger things season - just seem to be
a little bit too long
yeah cut out most of the first half yeah
yeah you could you could have depth you
definitely could have can really one
more tribe really wanted again yeah
that's a good point
stranger things season - you really
could have cut out two episodes of
content
you Philistines episode was great it was
great it cut the really fun episode yeah
get out of here get out here at that
shit
cut them play around with a salamander
for four episodes we're gonna find the
fella bandura right
ice board Zombrex
is that a showgirl
that's great yeah I love this I love the
Thord there's an easier thought I can
get so I'm not so worried about him
oh my god she's just sitting in there
puking yeah how fast would the Nerds
have joined you if you had her on your
team just as fast I didn't talk to the
right one enough or something that
slowed me down sure sure should still be
good yeah don't say doomsday she
apparently has been drinking a lot or is
she drunk maybe yeah
I believe she's had a bachelorette party
or something I don't know sure oh yeah
look she's drunk yo she's definitely
drunk no that's smaller on the floor
well yeah sure but that you know like
maybe you know she had some bad shrimp
we don't know she's too drunk to walk
yeah you're coming with me Kristen

morale in my safe house that's what
you're gonna do all right let's see here
where are we doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

1 it's an absolute crisis you're right
with three simple words I don't care
thank you keep up the good work great so
rare I hear common sense
I just you know I think it's important
that we establish a firm timeline and
our fantasy movies with Wizards really
important where are we
zu la Neos is rich yeah if you care to
explain as George Lucas why Luke is
better than ray no I don't care - that's
fine that's fine
das clown Stein says these people don't
even get the point of Empire the point
is that he's facing Vader without any
training but that means he never got the
training but he's the best Jedi ever
thank Fe that can't be I can't accept
that because I have to be mad at Rey I
have to be mad at Rey and this is why
I'm mad at Ray and if I met it ready for
this that means Luke obviously did
something different and so I because
because Luke is the best and I have to
be mad at Rey because that's what I
wrote on the internet you know das kann
sein that is a very good point if Luke
had had months of training it would make
the entire ending of Empire not make any
sense good on you dance clown Stein
that's why obi-wan and Yoda are
disappointed that he leaves for best Ben
it's almost it's almost as if all of
these internet people are just grasping
at straws but hey magnus loves Casey
says when oh um you know we were I was
talking about Star Wars for a while so
we're gonna hit some Star Wars right
when obi-wan tells Luke to trust the
force to hit the weak spot on the Death
Star
yes that's not the force that was the
books on tape he was listening to it's
all
tip of the year tip leer
Thank You Magnus loves case that was
perfect
chapter 17 guiding missiles with the
force Luke trust your instinct said I
training on tape he's had a year's worth
of training on tape yeah that's what we
were saying nipple bag Luke's the the
facts the whole purpose of Empire
Strikes Back is when when Luke faces
Vader he's woefully unprepared oh I know
and that's why that's why he loses ready
that's why he loses handily I hate you
and everyone you know it's true it's
true but you're part of that the people
I know so that means you hate you and I
know that's true
in any case in any case where were we we
were on social geometer social geometer
he says good evening gents
I am ohm what does I am oh yeah check
the factors I don't give a shit if Ray
is a Mary Sue she's the protagonist in a
fantasy series for children uh-huh he
can be the biggest motherfucking Mary
Sue in the world and I don't give a shit
I'm making fun of people who do
IMO is in my opinion okay thank you and
that's what I need to know where were we
good evening gents in my opinion many
superheroes would work better as period
pieces daredevil makes more sense if
Hell's Kitchen is a working-class Irish
neighborhood experiencing the late 60s
70s crime wave yeah does well I mean
technically that's just a lot of
street-level superheroes is the
Punishers backstory far better is
Vietnam fun the crazy war Jack the crazy
war right the the morally ambiguous
world yeah if you will yeah yeah I agree
I agree well he saw some horrible shit
and he wasn't quite the same afterwards
you know there is some stuff that bleeds
over just to war and post-traumatic
stress in general bond I agree I agree
and that's that's why I was saying there
are some things like The Punisher that
don't necessarily work with modern-day
sensibilities we are you know according
to available statistics crime has been
steadily dropping since the early 90s
it's not necessarily a pressing issue at
the moment is Iraq not crazy and morally
ambiguous it's a lot crazier if you're
an Iraqi if you're an American a lot of
it is pushing buttons from afar Vietnam
you're in the freaking jungles bad that
was probably some horrific shit yo and
remember Vietnam was also a larger scale
operations and these stories coming out
of Vietnam were a lot more horrifying
being in any war is terrible I'm not
saying if you're an American in the
iran-iraq you have it easy I'm not
saying that I'm saying Vietnam is
probably an order of magnitude were
insane well and speaking on morale
big Uwe T there were stories coming out
of Vietnam about what American soldiers
were doing to the people of the oh sure
that far exceeds the stories coming out
of any modern war where we have
different rule sets in different ways -
or um I'm just saying it fits better as
the backstory for someone like the
Punisher agreed agree this is why when
gar threw eNOS did Punisher max said
fucker the Punishers like in his fifties
he's a Vietnam vet he has to be a
Vietnam vet that's what works yeah
agreed
I'm with you oh yeah another good point
also Vietnam was had the draft people
were drafted into Vietnam people were
forced into war yeah unlike you know
modern skirmishes that we have talked
about cultural significance and what it
means to the culture Vietnam is the
crazy war yeah yeah I'm with you
the Iraq war that was the raw go troops
war not the Vietnam War
oh sure and I'm sure some awful shit
went down in Iraq
oh yeah sure of it but you know we're
talking and we're talking broad strokes
here people and I have to get her
motorcycle fight alright boss is fun
when you fight him on the motorcycle
yeah those people talk about how you can
choose him by getting when he gets stuck
into a great fuck that having the fight
proper it's a motorcycle fight you gotta
get some speed to RAM them yeah
Oh God but also he has chainsaws oh yeah
yeah oh you're the underdog that makes
it great Jackie didn't like the end of
punisher netflix where he's afraid now
that he doesn't have a war to fight no
no I overall I'm okay with Punisher
Netflix I actually liked that they were
kind of dealing with some of like his
character stuff and why he wants to kill
and is it just him or is it you know is
it the mission or is he always looking
for a new mission I get that I get that
I just thought there was there wasn't
the other part of the Punisher that I
like which is the violence it has some
good violence but not anywhere near what
we've already seen Jon Bernthal do as
The Punisher you know so I was a little
disappointed with that aspect of the
Punisher standalone series
can you you cannot you don't you can't
free look
I'm doing terrible I've done this fight
a lot better I'm sucking right you are
doing terrible The Punisher showed
didn't have a lot of violence i i'm sure
i'm trying to remember a memorable scene
allah-allah the jail house in daredevil
season 2 which i think is fantastically
violent scene or the torture scene with
the Punisher in daredevil season 2 that
was another great one I'm trying to
think of anything on that level in
daredevil and I'm not coming up with
them we're in Punisher
the first or second episode when he
kills four guys of the hammer it's
pretty awesome I you know what I just
don't remember that part of the binge
someone in chat was asking whether or
not daredevil season 2 is good I think
it starts off
it starts off incredibly strong it has
some great Punisher moments I think it
the final episode ends with a big old
thud in a way that's very disappointing
and it kind of Peaks
with five episodes left it kind of Peaks
mid season with some Punisher stuff and
then everyone's just twiddling their
thumbs for a couple episodes and that's
a little disappointing but overall I'd
say it's alright but it just it kind of
it leaves yanostamos Jack what was wrong
with baby drivers ending do you care
about baby driver kind of spoiled adding
a baby driver okay I'm gonna I want to
spoil the ending of baby driver so if
anyone doesn't want to hear that mute us
for the next I don't know four or five
minutes I'm gonna talk about baby driver
for a little bit
son of a bitch yeah you got to end him
faster so this isn't good yeah so in
baby driver baby is is the getaway
driver for a crew of criminals put
together by Kevin Spacey and Kevin
Spacey is typical criminal mastermind as
typical criminal mastermind were when
baby wants to get out of the
organization Kevin Spacey threatens the
people closest to baby
hey I know you're living with your
adopted father and he's you know he's
deaf and in and needs a care so man I
hope nothing bad happens to him hey I
know you're seeing this lady it'd be a
shame if anything ever happened to her
you know if you stopped driving for me
typical bad guy shit right then their
last heist the big heist goes sour at
the end of the movie shocking I know
and baby manages to get the money and
everything back to Kevin Spacey and in
some character turn that comes out of
fucking nowhere Kevin Spacey decides to
sacrifice himself to save baby and his
girlfriend out of fucking nowhere Kevin
Spacey's like I'll hold everyone up you
get out of here baby you go mega it's
like you've been threatening his family
and forcing him to be a criminal this
entire movie then I don't know where
overall I think that baby driver is very
good movie
I'm a little cynical about it because it
feels just like almost a YouTube editing
experiment more than a movie it's very
light story wise but every scene is
edited to a song and so it's
really cool it's wrong I didn't mean to
do that oh I've attached the guns to the
bike I meant to get on the bike that's
that I attached my guns to it I'm sure
oh but wanted I really wanted that guns
it's just bad
sure I get you but no I think baby
driver is a very good movie it just has
that super lame character turn at the
end and I also don't like how like the
end of the movie there's a courtroom
scene because baby gets busted at the
end I've warned people spoilers he gets
busted at the end but then in the
courtroom scene there's a montage of all
the people he was nice to like forever
who were all character witnesses oh baby
was a nice kid he was nice too he he
stole my car but he was so polite you
know so he gets time off for good
behavior and you know like so it's it
kind of its kind of a weak ending but
overall very cool movie very cool
it's taking time to do this though so I
still did bad oh sure
Titan Creed says Edgar Wright's movies
tend to be a bit too concept driven for
their endings from a characterization
takes a backseat to some big idea that
is a fair criticism you know they're
cool they're good-looking movies they're
cool movies and they have fun ideas but
yeah sometimes a little weak as far as
characters or story points that kind of
stuff but I'm okay
mall weasel yeah all that all the
courtroom scene made sense because like
he was quasi being forced to be a
getaway driver and yes he was overall a
good kid but it just felt kind of it
felt kind of a hokey for like a movie
all about the big heist in crime I don't
know a better way to end it but that's
how they ended it I probably would have
preferred him and the girl just taking
the cash and riding off into the sunset
yeah as criminals you know like we're
gonna start a new life baby and his girl
we got a car we got a bag full of cash
we're gonna start a new life that's
probably how I would have preferred the
ending button
anyway it's alright overall it's a baby
drivers a good movie it was a fun it's a
it's a fun movie is what it is it's very
light-hearted good tone Jamie Foxx
awesome Jamie Foxx gives a great
performance Jon Hamm is in it he's great
but I mean they're great and everything
so is that really a compliment in any
way this good this good actor who's
consistently good is good in the movie
so rectal I'm alive I think I think it's
hard to compare a movie like baby driver
to the last Jedi they're two very
different beasts
oh-hoo dad the bad guy the bit was the
beard guy well that didn't help that
didn't help
oh he was the announcer yeah yeah yeah
okay I didn't recognize him without his
big coat spoilers I I'm probably not
gonna play it so go ahead spoil the chap
mine spoilers your old game because it's
a casino heist zombies all around
there's no police that can come in there
free to just loot the casinos nice so
they let the zombies in yep blame the
blame this guy blame the schlub so I
could steal all the money in the casino
all right I'm down with that
every casino in the city Jack it's a
huge iced not just one casino and
beating them all because they run the
zombie game show they have access to all
the zombies oh that's good rich I like
it I dig it
that's some quality luck right there
release the Z bomb if you will yeah but
the Z bomb is just a truck full of
zombies yeah yeah
then where are they going to use the
money when society is collapses this is
the misconception with dead rising yeah
it is not a zombie apocalypse that's
that's actually kind of what you prevent
in the first game but there's there's
still occasional outbreaks here or there
so this is localized right this city is
being currently corn at quarantined by
the government they're surrounding it
right there containing it but the rest
the rest of the the country the rest of
the world is fine sure like it's like
influenza like everyone gets that shot
but every once in a while yes a big
outbreak happens in a city right Society
is obviously up and running enough to
say have a pharmaceutical company be
creating zombie medicine right yeah I've
I'm with you a dig at dig I suppose that
that is just a general like trope in
zombie movies if zombies are somewhere
they're everywhere right I can see where
someone would get the misconception
Lloyd beets I have not heard anything
about when the rlm website will be back
up rich soon I think
yeah yeah okay I know in fact I don't
know all you know which is that Jay said
on Twitter that they're they're
revamping update
nice yeah you know oh I just like I need
to get better I just like the fact that
you have to jump on the train with a
motorbike I think that's nice oh yeah
that's a neat little a neat little
scenario that they put you in something
which by the way I think you know a more
modern game would have just done in a
cutscene like a cool cutscene there and
then maybe you have to press X to jump
yeah in modern day games yes but here
they're like now let's like let you ride
a motorcycle you got to get on the track
I wish they would let me switch between
a mouse and a controller they do don't I
have just like one of the other and like
the options menu oh I would so be doing
these sections with mouse and keyboard
yeah yeah
yeah alright let's see what we got here
a social geometer says regarding period
superheroes consider a 1939 back regular
gangsters as villains less emphasis on
armor and gadgets more on martial arts
and stealth check out since you're
suggesting this who is this this is
social geometer check out it's a little
bit old right now Sandman mystery
theatre fuck yes that's this is what
you're talking about Sandman mystery
theatre is a great series of borders
yeah fuck yeah fantastic
I want no not Neil Gaiman's Sandman
right around the same time I think
they're both vertical books - yeah but
Sandman mystery theatre entirely
different spiritual ante stuff oh it's
great I want a movie or a TV show that's
Sandman mystery theatre just like
slightly a cultish stuff if they had a
Sandman mystery theatre CW show I'd
watch it
fuck yeah in a heartbeat
any anywhere I'd watch it in a heartbeat
it's just like classic hard-boiled
detective with a little hint of the
supernatural justa it's not even over
the top with with the action no this
whole gimmick is these Sandman he uses
knockout gas his only superpower is that
he has a gas mask that's in anything he
investigates crime yeah and it's not
about punching a bunch of people wow
it's so great he hunts down via cults
like you know like oh that this
devil-worshiping cult is murdering smell
Cho maybe I could never figure that how
and he just has gas he is knockout gas
that's it oh it's that those are some
good ass books I haven't read um have
you ever read Gotham by Gaslight I've
heard about it I didn't have it I think
it was a long time ago I don't remember
anything that happens in it because what
is that is that like 1800s bat
Jack the Ripper Edmund vs. Jack the
Ripper I've heard good things about that
doing sort of bad but not awful bad you
haven't died yet have you saved it
i well here's the all right this is well
this is part of the learning process
yeah Dead Rising 2 has a shitload of
hidden survivors like you don't get an
alert like so I'm on the security
monitor Jack they're over in the
shipyard you gotta go pick them up sure
there's a lot you just have to find them
I do not I'm not even anywhere close to
having them all memorized so for your no
death run you're not going for a hundred
percent perfect I would I would love to
have a 100 percent perfect run sure sure
but I'll settle for just not dying and
getting the main story okay I'll settle
for that all right I would loved it like
like Dead Rising one like that I would
love save everyone yeah that's the ideal
okay
Oh aye sir damn three cases guess who
Jack the Ripper was in Gotham by
Gaslight yeah I could like yeah of
course we know who Jack the Ripper is
you know the only Batman villain ever
used yeah we get it but I've heard good
things about the city the book I haven't
read it yet black panther it's coming
close i no get hype everyone
I've been see I don't know I don't know
if it's just because I've like been
watching because I watch like a lot of
you know superhero television shows but
I've just been seeing nothing but trail
you know promotional material for Black
Panther every single commercial vote
break is Black Panther and yes I've been
watching Black Lightning and so maybe
like they're just you know they're just
marketing to a strong they're just
marketing to a crowd who's already
watching a black superhero and so
they're like let's just promote our
black superhero getting slightly hyped
for Black Panther yes getting a
controller to work with this game on PC
is a hassle is it it's for games for
Windows Live not for Steam originally
and and this is why you don't trust like
downloadable services yeah online
net-net game nannies like Steam yeah
because you know game for Windows Live
was defunct and steam vents but the
controller support is just Blanco in
order to get my the Xbox one pro
controller that I splurged on to work I
I had to download like a old version of
this gamepad emulating software x360 CEO
so I had to track down an older version
of the controller emulation software
that was compatible but it seems it
seems to work natively with just the
regular wired 360 controller oh that's
good good I have heard that about black
cougar and that's that's the first
superhero that protects the children
that's right about the black cougar
i I think I might try to talk someone
here into doing a review of Blankman for
upcoming Black Panther there yeah for
you know in in honor of Black Panther to
talk about you know the first black
superhero movie that I remember growing
up which is Blankman a fucking great
movie that I personally love the crap
out of check I don't I don't have
anything inherent against controllers
I prefer controllers I mean I prefer
mouse and keyboard for anything that
requires aiming but there are plenty of
games I like using controllers for just
fine and if I'm going to use a
controller honestly the the Xbox pro
controller is really nice oh god it's so
great yeah
xbox pro controllers where it's at have
you even messed around with any of the
flippers those are those are family
really for certain games maybe I fucking
should fuck no a blank man be LAN cave
blank man is a damon wayans superhero
show about a DIY superhero he he builds
his own gadgets out of garbage and I
remember it being fantastic i walked i
watch the crap out of that yeah we can
probably do a blank man and meteor man
like double feature review racist
they're both individual movies Jack
prominent black superhero movies rich
nothing racist about it all I heard was
blank check review in a heartbeat in a
heartbeat
I know blank check front to back right I
could do that right now
without even having seen it in a decade
I can do a blank check review right
because I love it tone loke okay give it
up for tone Lok oh my god it's Chris
Hemsworth look at that guy long hair
it's cuz here buff body oh well I'm just
I'm just going off of looks Elrod and
Trixie Lin where were we how about Joe
kitty 0:01 anyone gets sick during the
flu epidemic no no I felt a little
guilty I did not get a flu shot this
year you're supposed to get one even if
you are healthy and not necessarily
around anyone who will get the food
because then you're you know you won't
spread it even if you don't get sick you
might spread the flu so I know you're
supposed to get a flu shot
this next part is going to be hard
alright
like I'm probably gonna die hard I give
it yes anything in general everyone has
advised to get a flu shot too for a
while
except for pathetic points out the term
of it which is herd immunity yeah you
got Wolverine claws are good no I'm
sorry alright where are we here lick my
love bit says The Simpsons failed when
they killed Ned's wife leaving Ned the
sympathetic single parent homers hatred
of him thusly becomes ugly jokes at the
expense of grieving spouses not so funny
true I can't argue with that
we did get some fine episodes though out
of like you know Ned looking for love in
all the wrong places they ever have Ned
get remarried you know there on season
58 now it's he's probably gotten
remarried several times
well they got married to the Vegas
ladies before Maude dying too because
you know her the the joke there was you
know while Homer was trying to get his
to run away Ned's just wanted to run
away she didn't want to be part of Mensa
when we got here I am a for 20 hours as
I just watched the last six spider-man
movies that's yeah there's two there are
six modern science by der man's movies
homecoming is the best yeah yeah I've
been saying that I'm echoing I'm echoing
man homecoming is the best spider-man
movie we have but I thought the amazing
movies were really very good no not sure
why people didn't like I'm curious what
you guys thought of them first ones just
blah and the second one she stuff all
around hot mess story-wise stylistically
character wise it's a hot mess but like
even even the first one starts you off
with a mystery of Peter Parker's parents
right like there's there's a conspiracy
about his parents but then they kind of
forget about that and then it turns into
a moody love story and then they kind of
forget about that and then the lizard
shows up and it's over the amazing
spider-man one is all over the place and
it it's the worst spider-man movie
because it's the absolute worst
portrayal of Peter Parker out of its
anon Amy Andrew Garfield was like a non
portrayal of Peter Parker fucking
mannequin yes but he was also super cool
well liked by everyone a skater guy a
photographer
he was just everything and nothing at
the same time
yeah yeah no I think it was just the
worst
this guy's decided we all need to join
this on base oh okay he's gonna try to
get that poor girl bit me
Oh
he's not wearing unbell appends pins
have like a red cross on them and they
say cure oh shit
oh my god you're leaving they have my
weapons for this point Oh Nick guitar is
a fairly fast swing which is what I need
for him ok that's alright my bats not
gonna cut it
I'm sure dr. arbitrary says hey I'm an
idiot who doesn't know how the whole tip
thing works can someone link to an
explanation or something dude this
should there's a button underneath this
video that says tip us you know give us
money if you want or don't whatever and
that should take you to a little forum
where it asks you for some like PayPal
information and you you decide there if
you want to tip us but the romance
aspect is good but the romance aspect
didn't do or really mean anything and
then we get that the point at the end of
amazing spider-man where Denis Leary is
like I know you spider-man and I'm cool
with it but I'm dying you can't date
Gwen because it'll put her in danger and
he's like ok I won't but then the very
next scene he's like maybe I'll date
Gwen I don't know like nothing it was a
movie where nothing meant anything
do you dear heavy attacks you slovers I
think you're gonna get one swing in fuck
you man ah why do I remember so much of
the amazing spider-man that's a good
question I saw it once in the movie
theater when it was in the movie theater
but a lot of its burned in because
that's how it works with me sometimes
and whoever's I don't know who's talking
about Marisa Tomei but I think she's a
great a me I think Marissa May is great
time burning time I gotta go I gotta go
get healing though man that fight not
going well for me I'm gonna say I see
then I see that about you and that fight
is there a better weapon for that fight
gonna guitar he's too quick okay
I've tried the bat trust me oh yeah I
know I'm just saying like in general
like can you grab a sword is there
something that'll do more damage really
sword the sword is really slow okay
basically I get two hits with a guitar
I've done it where I've gotten two hits
and gotten away where I can get one hit
with a sword movie I'd like a bowie
knife if I could try that but I don't so
is is what is is yeah I'm sorry
so much
you know it is like just in in the
spider-man in in all the different
spider-man's that we've had throughout
the years the the one thing that I have
universally always hated is old weak on
her deathbed Aunt May
I've never been a fan of that oh yeah
just the Aunt May that would faint and
have heart palpitations at the thought
of spider-man in general oh my stars
I've always hated that so I'm more than
okay with with young and together Aunt
May another thing I think they they very
smartly borrowed from the ultimate comic
books
oh Jesus Christ you can do it so much
time Jack Bruns I know as far as
infinity war I think rich is pretty well
checked out of Marvel movies at this
point I'm looking forward to infinity
war yeah okay that's fair then like I
kind of had had you pegged as Matt no no
I'm pretty warm looking forged okay i'm
i'm super hyped for infinity war a
gathering of anyone who is even cameoed
in any Marvel Marvel movie is going to
be in it all of them together just it's
going to be I feel I feel it's going to
be an Avengers type event shit's gonna
get real so I'm surprised
Black Panther is out next month I
believe
remember in the age of Ultron view
everyone seemed to not get agent yeah
age of Ultron was not necessarily an
event it was just it was just an
Avengers movie I still think Ultron is a
good Avengers movie but it was just an
Avengers movie unlike the first Avengers
which was an event that was everyone
coming together for the first time is
this gonna work oh my god this is a big
thing right all leading up to the epic
360 we're all working together as a team
shot and like they've been teasing
they've been teasing Ultron now since
Avengers fan oh you're right Ultron oh
yeah they've been teasing fan OHS since
Avengers he's been in little pieces of
movies for years now there's so much
built-up hype for him as a main bad guy
oh you were referring to nobody giving a
fuck about infinity war run run oh my
god that was for the course which shit I
suppose at the time my coming right out
of age of Ultron yeah I probably I
probably didn't give a shit about
infinity war yeah you have awful I have
to find a better way to do that fight
that almost took you
suck it Kurt Cobain that's I think he's
more Zack de la Rocha a la rage against
the machine guns if you use a projectile
weapon against him he actually goes
berserk on you what is that and like
like knocks you down and search climbs I
need to start stabbing at you okay kind
of keyboard did I use when I played in
bands I had a what was it called
Alexa micron god it's been a while in a
while I want to say it was an election
election micron but I don't know if I'm
confusing that with the Amazon digital
assistant Alexa
I probably am sorry if I'm triggering
people's echoes right
is this a real thing I've got nothing
with Alexa micron all right hold on let
me let me Google really quick and I'll
tell you exactly
I don't like so maybe uh what's a
keyboard company that's like Alexa it
was like rad gonna be something very
different alesis oh thank you space come
oh maybe that's it alesis oh I don't
know if it was análisis now what was it
hold on I can tell you I can tell you
give me one second here give me one
second I'm gonna find this out I'm gonna
find this out
I know how I can find this out you just
got to give me give me just a minute god
damn it give me a minute I can do it I
can find it
ah yeah okay that's what it was it was
análisis micron that was the keyboard I
used it had a ton of functionality I had
a lot of easy tweaking of tones and and
some and it was also like for for a
smaller keyboard it had full-size keys
and and that was really important I had
I first got an even smaller one I was
like a Moog or how to move a Korg it was
a Korg micro one but it had tiny tiny
keys and my big fat fingers didn't do
well with those so I got the alesis
micron because it has full-size keys
a poor micro maybe maybe that's what I
had a pork might know a Korg Kor G a
Korg micro I think that's what I all
right where are we where are we
casual horse says isn't it fun
