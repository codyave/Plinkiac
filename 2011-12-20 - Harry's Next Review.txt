Plinkett #1: Whoa. And she shivered, as he thrust his towering rod into her moist, quivering love button. Yeah. That's right. You take it, baby.
Palpatine: Arise, Lord Plinkett.
Plinkett #1: What?
Palpatine: The time has come.
Plinkett #1: What?
Palpatine: The time for your next review is here at last.
Plinkett #1: My, my next review? I, I don't know what you're talking about.
Palpatine: What? Why, your next movie review. For the internets.
Plinkett #1: What's the internet? I, I don't do movie reviews.
Palpatine: What? Where am I? Ugh, fucking MapQuest.
Plinkett #2: Okay, honeypie. I got my pizza rolls, and now I'm all set. Show me that business. Oh, yeah. Ooh la la. That's right, baby. Take it off. But do it slowly, cuz this cost me three Medicare checks.  
Palpatine: If you are not the real Plinkett, I will search him out with the dark side of the force. 
Plinkett #2: Wait a minute, I sense a presence I've not felt since...
Palpatine: Good, good...I have found the real Lord Plinkett. You cannot hide from me.
Plinkett #2: Oh, god. What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?
Palpatine: Busy? Busy wasting your time with hookers and pizza rolls. Oh, Lord Plinkett. I believe you know what you're destiny is.
Plinkett #2: What?
Palpatine: Your destiny is to review a certain movie.
Plinkett #2: What?
Palpatine: And that movie is called Quigley, starring Gary Busey as a talking dog.
Plinkett #2: Um, no.
Palpatine: What? So be it. If you will not review Quigley, then at least review The Dark Knight Rises teaser trailer. The movie looks like fucking shit. Christopher Nolan, what an overrated hack. I could make a better film.
Plinkett #2: Meh. How am I supposed to review a trailer? I haven't even seen the movie.
Palpatine: Well, fine, then. If you will not review either of those two, then please, at least review Follow that Bird, the first Sesame Street feature film. They got Big Bird's character all wrong. I do not consider that canon.
Plinkett #2: Eh, I don't know about those. How about I just review this instead?
Palpatine: I will accept that. My business is finished here. I'm going to leave now. Die, fake Plinkett!
Plinkett #1: Auugh, what are you doing? Ow, that hurts! Ow, stop it! Oh, god, oh, god.
