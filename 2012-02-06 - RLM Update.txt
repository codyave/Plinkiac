Hurry up, Qui-Gon!
Oh, hi.
I'm Mike, from Half in the Bag.
Jay couldn't be here today to tell you the exciting news that the Star Wars prequels are now available on Blu-ray.
You can purchase these at your local retailers.
Please purchase these products as soon as possible.
I've done everything you've ask--
And in other exciting news, Star Wars Episode: The Phantom Menace will be back in theaters Friday, February 10th.
In 3-D.
Isn't the 3d revival fad over with yet, you say?
Nope.
3-D's gonna be around at least until the end of the year.
I mean, forever.
Wow.
Amazing.
