Feeding Frenzy
"Our film FEEDING FRENZY is available on DVD! Check out the trailer, plus a message from Plinkett" (archive.vn/0undr)

Come in.
Lock the door, please.
Um, I'd rather leave it unlocked.
And I'd rather you didn't.
Okay.
Listen, mister, I charge more for cripples.
Why?
Because it's more work on my part.
I guess that makes sense.
So what are your rates?
It's $50 for head, $300 for everything else.
But don't do any weird shit, mister.
So if you want me to put a diaper on you, and breastfeed you, you can forget it.
Oh, and no cuddling, either.
Oh, that's okay, honey.
I like it like that.
I want the whole pussy caboodle.
Don't worry, though.
This will be over real fast.
I pray to Jesus that's true.
Okay.
Before I start, uh, I need to see the money.
Good.
You just toss that on the bed.
Not so fast.
I want to make sure you're worth it.
Give me a preview.
Um, I don't do previews.
I'll double your rates.
Okay.
Show me how you suck it.
Yeah.
Oh, that's good, just like that.
Right.
That's right.
Get down there.
Get down there where you belong.
Yeah.
Just like that.
Yeah.
How's it taste?
You like the taste of my candycane.
Yeah.
Oh, that's good, just like that.
Eat it.
Eat it with your mouth.
Ah, great.
Another squirter.

[...]

Eat it with your mouth.
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?
Not so great.
Uh, I think Carl's dead, and Christine is about to die.
About to?
What happened?
Where is she?
Uh, the monsters turn into one giant one or something, and chased us around the woods.
But she said she wouldn't sleep with me, so I told her to piss off and left.
Oh.
Oh, sorry I didn't call you.
Um, I had another heart attack.
And, uh, you remember that time you told me to get a Life Alert bracelet?
Well, I did.
Look.
And it saved my life.
Oh, my god.
Well, I told you to get the Life Alert bracelet so that I wouldn't be bothered with shocking your heart anymore.
And, so that you would be able to get help if I wasn't around.
You see?
For that one brief moment, you thought about someone other than yourself.
You saved my life, Jesse Camp.
In your own retarded way.
Oh, fuck.
Eh.
What are you watching.
Oprah.
Please.
No!!
Oh, fuck my life.
Oh, god.
Why don't I move?
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck.
You actually came back for me.
Even I said I wouldn't even sleep with you.
I ran all the way here.
What is that thing?
It's a defibrillulator.
The thing was really conducive to electricity.
Must've been all the radiation.
What do you say we find a nice place to lower me under a Thalomy willows.
Huh?
Oh, not that hole.
That's the monster.
