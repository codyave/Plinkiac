"Video: Plinkett’s decision on what to review next appears to be getting clouded by the dark side…" (archive.vn/yn065)

Lord Plinkett, what is your next review?
Twilight.
What?
Twilight.
The one that's out now now?
No, the first one.
Oh. I have foreseen your next review. It is unavoidable. It is your destiny.
Cop Dog?
What? I can feel your anger.
Look, would you just get out of my bathroom?
I sense great fear in you.
That's not fear you sense in me. That's taco salad.
Now make the review.
No.
Do it.
Stop it.
Do it.
