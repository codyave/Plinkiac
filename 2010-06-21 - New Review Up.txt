This mic on?
Hello?
Hello?
I made a new review.
I just finished it.
It's up on my webzone, redlettermedia.com.
Everybody's seen it but you.
You can post a comment on the video if you want.
Eventually, I'll upload it here if you wanna wait.
But, I dunno.
It's gonna be a while, idiot.
A lot of people say my new review sucks.
You wanna know what I think sucks?
The people that said that.
I gotta go.
My cat called the spousal abuse hotline again.
My cat keeps telling them that I beat it.
But it's not true.
It's fucking lying.
My cat fell down the stairs.
