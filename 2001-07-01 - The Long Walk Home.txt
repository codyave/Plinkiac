The Long Walk Home

Hello, Jackie.
I turned in my badge a few days ago.
I know you think I'm probably overreacting.
Well, not this time.
It's just, the force was overrun with corruption.
It was hard to say no.
I got in too deep. 
[Contreras] double-crossed me.
He killed you because of me.
I miss seeing your face in the morning.
I miss waking up next to you.
Paul.
Paul is only eight years old.
Gunter.
I see your wife is in one of these graves.
A lesson, perhaps.
You'd be in one, too, if you didn't like the work that you did for us.
Go ahead and shoot me, Gunther.
It seems to be what you do best.
You got greedy, Jack.
Don't make the same mistake as your wife.
The only thing I'm greedy for is revenge.
If you're gonna shoot me, now's your chance.
The night is cold.
The sidewalk seemed to stretch on forever.
How was I gonna do this?
How was I gonna cross the traffic, long enough to see justice served?
