Hey, everybody, it's Mike. 
And we're in Toronto, Ottawa, for the 2012 Fan Expo. 
As you can see behind me, fans are streaming into the event this morning. 
So I can't wait to get inside, interview some celebrities, check out some movie screenings. 
They've got live-action role-playing, costume competitions, and you can even play video games. 
So let's go check things out.  
Alright, we're in the convention center now. 
Let's take a look around to see what's going on. 
I'm sorry. 
It's just really crowded. 
Alright, next we're gonna interview legendary director John Carptenter. 
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bump right into you. 
Sorry, I'm very sorry. 
Excuse me. 
Well, I wasn't able to make it over to John Carpenter, but I'm gonna go check out some video games right now. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Well, I wasn't able to make it over to the video games, but now I'm gonna try to get to Rose McGowan's Q&A panel. 
Let's go. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
It's happening again. 
I think it's this way. 
Oops, I'm sorry. 
Oh, my god. 
I'm sorry. 
There's a baby crying in my ear. 
Oh, my bad.
I'm so sorry. 
Oh, thank god.
