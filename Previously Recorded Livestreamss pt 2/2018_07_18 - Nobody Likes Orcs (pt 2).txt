radioactive yes I'm seeing radioactive
something something radioactive mud is
listing some fantastic Doctor Who
episodes that Steven Moffat wrote under
the showrunner Russell T Davies and I do
think that Moffat has some good ideas
wrote one of the greatest Moffat wrote
one of the greatest Doctor Who episodes
ever called blink like if you're gonna
show someone an episode of Doctor Who
you showed him this episode it's
fantastic but I think as showrunner I
think I think it's a bit of a prequel
situation where he just had too much
power and there wasn't anyone there to
balance his power to hold him back and
and that's what I think his problem lies
the impossible you know what and hit no
The Impossible Astronaut is a fine
episode the the whole the silence the
silence is is what a great villain what
a great enemy I think he started he
started his show running tenure all
right and it was a slow slip so slow
slip I love those initial episodes with
the silence were so fantastic what a
great what a great bit an enemy that
makes you forget about them as soon as
you're not looking at them
yeah and so that it just you know these
characters being horrified seeing the
enemy and then they'd immediately look
away and forget they ever existed so
what they started doing was like making
little hash marks on their arms whenever
they saw one and then so suddenly it
would cut too wide and their arms would
just be covering it was brilliant great
episodes but it just didn't last
it just didn't last
out
oh he was also writing Sherlock at the
same time no maybe a lesson learned
don't spread yourself too thin
sounds like a Voyager episode I to me
like that's doctor who filled that Star
Trek void and me even though it was a
little more fantasy ish it filled that
space adventure void for me obviously
that first season yeah you know some ups
and downs but but uh especially that
first episode Rose what a terrible
episode what terrible television that
was the mannequins that come to life
yeah what garbage TV that was but then
they started I think the slowly working
and then really you know for a lot of
people I know once David Tennant was
there and it turned into a whole new
ballgame
yeah pre anything pre Clara Clara is
when it really started to tumble that's
what that's when I gave up she's a she
was a companion I gather that much she
was a companion
why is she terrible um she was a nothing
character or or more so she was so she
was so many things that she was nothing
specific she was everything she had no
defining character or weakness or even
anything she was good at she was just
mildly she was whatever the script
needed that episode and so it was hard
to latch on to her as a character
the role of a companion is is just to
you know to be the be the protagonist
really bits that's supposed to be the
audience's window into this crazy world
you're supposed to be the companion is
supposed to be the the naive one that
the one that's just along for the ride
as the doctor shows you all these
amazing things and Clara was just was
just nothing and everything
that's where a rich rich that's what
rich is doing his job with Becky got
plate says I like how rich prompts Jack
to just keep talking about Doctor Who so
he can focus on playing the game
rich is doing his job
I got nothing bad when it comes to
Doctor Who I know I know I know doctor
who's the thing that's all like that's
all I know it's a thing it's a thing
yeah oh the Donna doctor Donna Donna was
a fantastic companion this this did you
ever watch the office yeah did you ever
watch any of the later seasons yeah do
you remember when that the British woman
was on the office big hair
think so I think so she was in Doctor
Who and her name was Donna okay she was
a companion for for just a season if
that even I don't even know if she made
an entire season and quite possibly one
of the most fantastic companions ever
just full of comedy just a big
personality incredulous at every turn
and you know given the doctor all sorts
of shit she was fantastic
Catherine Tate is her name collapse not
Sharon Tate not a season more like four
or five episodes what however many
episodes she was in she was fantastic
just just doing all she could to to give
the doctor all the hell in the world and
just a heartbreaking ending to her as
companion there's so many good
companions everybody's good I've rows of
it like the whole Rose doctor they're in
love they're not in love situation was
wonderful I really liked theory they
could bring David Tennant back and they
didn't they didn't they have David
Tennant's doctors split off into two
people and then one went into the
alternate universe with Rose I think
this is something I heard about an owl
first of all I'm shocked that you know
that osmosis
they just osmosis they did do that but I
think they actually might have needed to
kill him in the alternate universe okay
to stop the next big tragedy
I don't remember precisely but yes your
ass Moses is correct but really they
could bring David Tennant back whatever
because the doctor can regenerate as
whatever I don't think they could ever
bring him back like or just time travel
or just time-traveling like oh well
actually this season takes place when
David Tennant was still the document
boom right oh yeah Oh Martha you know
Marv Martha's one of the mark Martha's
almost a she's not much of a companion
though she was there for some of the
best episodes I think the episodes
outshined Martha as a companion but she
is there for most of the great episodes
and she was alright as a companion no
complaints
Oh God why did I say that name why I
said mana mana hey she was fine right
look like you can't say anything bad
about Martha there's nothing wrong with
Martha but she also didn't have a super
amazing character to bring to the doctor
who table you know what I got a start I
got I think I'm gonna revenge dr. Google
all this doctor who talk is really
starting to starting to itch at me I've
gotta see where I can find dr. who
Martha from the Americans is she what
did she do after that Martha after that
oh I think she was insensate I think
that's the same actress she's she's I'll
kind of forget all their names she's the
girlfriend insensate if you watch that
somebody's telling you to start from the
third doctor I don't know if I can go
that far back I might just Eccleston I
might just Eccleston it eccleston binge
what are you trying wait wait wait try
like an 80s doctor or a 90's doctor well
the only 90s doctor is is the movie okay
right when did when did they stop dr.
who I don't know doctor who's on Amazon
oh nice
I'd you know I don't I I think the only
90s doctor was the made-for-tv movie
they might have stopped what are you
guys saying eighty eighties
the Cousteau's right that okay that is
her insensate that's right she's
introduced with a big strap-on dildo
correct correct
that's her that's a that's what she's
doing now yeah you know what I'm not I'm
probably not gonna go back to me Oh any
of the old doctors I have a hard time
with with older stuff it's hard for me
to latch on to just storytelling and
technology wise we've come so far apart
I would good newer stuff you know that
was a quality doesn't dick move as a
quality thing that's fine I'll take it
that's such a lame argument I'm not it's
not an argument it's it's what I'm
telling you I have a hard time with
older movies and TV shows because they
don't connect with me in the same way
that newer stuff does Star Trek to us
you know I've never gotten into Star
Trek Fury's probably wouldn't based on
what I marry I've seen like I've seen a
couple of really good episodes but like
overall yeah
and it's it's not it's something that I
that that doesn't speak to me like like
next gen dies whew Twilight zones that's
a whole different realm Twilight Zone is
timeless Twilight Zone is fancy and it's
every episode of The Twilight Zone is
that is absolutely timeless there is
nothing that holds the Twilight Zone
back it's perfect and beautiful I just
okay
yes yeah absolutely everyone's corrects
why light zone is that cannot be
compared to other TV or movies or
properties it's just it's it is what it
is which is amazing
well of course Twilight Zone is better
than Black Mirror but the black mirror
is what we have now we don't have new
episodes of Twilight Zone so Black
Mirror will do in a pinch it's ok what
we it's all we have
and I'll take it black mirror is very
good I enjoy black mirror but you know
we're not getting new Rod Serling
unfortunately no CGI Rod Serling would
be a weird thing yes yes it would be you
know if you get some decent writers you
put John hands up there as a rod serling
standed Jon Hamm who was doing basically
a Rod Serling an impression in season 2
of Legion he did some voiceover in
season 2 of Legion and he was basically
doing imagine a world and it works out
shockingly well
right anonymous says what are your
thoughts on SpongeBob SquarePants I
didn't have cable growing up but I
recently watched the first two seasons
and I'm kind of amazed by how good it is
I've literally never seen an episode of
Spongebob Squarepants I was too old by
the time it was the thing right well and
you know I've like back I want a
spongebob might have been out know that
was passed my stoner days I've seen some
spongebob I think at at its best
spongebob can be at its best spongebob
is a low-rent ren and stimpy yeah it can
be it can be weird and bizarre and
surreal but you know it's also a
straight-up kids cartoon but you know
it's not the worst can ain't the worst
what's so good about the twilight zone
I've been thinking about starting it
class timeless timeless class yeah and
philosophical musings and pitch perfect
setup and payoff and storytelling and
pacing and everything they did
everything right
not every episode is amazing but enough
are enough are where you could just say
every episode is amazing and get away
with it
how about that it was weird an era where
I can't imagine how that ended up on TV
yeah I can't imagine how the twilight
zone
ended up on TV in the era of Donna Reed
well but that was also like the height
of you know pulp
you know pulp fiction right like they
were super into that
bizarro noir II narratives you know
golden or silver Age of science fiction
they were yeah that was fine I don't
have the blu-rays of this why lights on
button you know on I'm that's that's not
a bad idea
yeah acting was fantastic just the lot
of good actors got their start in the
twilight zone higher presentation they
there's craft and there's care in
Twilight Zone who got there how many
people were on the fucking Twilight Zone
burger burger if it's on the twilight
zone
young Burt Reynolds I think is on an
episode of The Twilight Zone Leslie
Nielsen Leslie Nielsen is he on an
episode I want to say he's an episode of
The Twilight Zone
William Shatner's in two different
episodes got some early shit yeah we're
talking 50s 60s Twilight Zone Dennis
Hopper Wow Wow
they're very good at finding future
actors well
future famous actors to be fair they
were also probably the chief actors but
but they were good at utilizing the
cheap actors they're good at identifying
which one of them had which ones of them
had talent and we're going to eventually
be somebody
I don't know the letter Nimoy was have
around the Twilight Zone no episode I
can remember her head Leonard Nimoy I
don't know
Tomic mousetrap says I can't stand
Nicholson's Joker or most of that movie
do you think Joker is often interpreted
badly oh how often has he been
interpreted really at very least two
dozen times I'm sure different
iterations of comics cartoons movies
shows well I'm talking about
live-action we have three Cesar Romero
Cesar
she's a Romero yeah for the time was a
pitch-perfect Joker that was what the
Joker was like in the fucking comic
books back then uh-huh Cesar Romero was
perfect
mustache aside just paint over it's fine
yeah Jack Nicholson is playing Jack
Nicholson with some face makeup yeah I
don't I don't care much for that Joker
either it's fine Mark Hamill definitive
but he still does the Joker to this day
perfect of course what's-his-face Heath
Ledger it's perfect damn fine take on
the Joker
perfect perfect take I like his take of
the Joker so what a lot of good jokers
and then we know I guess I haven't seen
it I've heard it's terrible oh it's
terrible yeah it's unwatchable so at
least half of them are good for live
action for live action well I guess Mark
Hamill wasn't live action oh well your
your slightly under half your your your
live actions your 2 out of 5 for live
action oh you two out of for a live
action for live action right Romero
Romero Nicholson Nicholson Ledger
Leto oh yeah do for to do for do do for
Jim and you know what I'll be I'll be on
the site and I can't speak much for
George Romero's not George Romero's this
Cesar Romero George Romero right right
very different I can't speak much for
Cesar Romero's Joker but I I don't mind
Nicholson's Joker I think
I get what he was doing and he you know
it made sense for the time as they has
worked in that movie I worked in that
movie and remember this was the awkward
years of superhero movies they were
still finding their footing so it was
fine but you know Heath Ledger has a has
a perfect interpretation of a joker and
front you know I I know you're probably
asking about Joker stuff because the the
fucking Phoenix Joker standalone Joker
movie is now like in it is the big
gossip around town yeah as they might be
doing to be the Joker origin story movie
I wouldn't say Osama crossdressers I
wouldn't say perfect
I think eath ledger like you might not
care for his interpretation but what I'm
saying by perfect is is its exact it it
fits tonally with the movie and with the
story and with the theme you might not
care for the interpretation but it's
perfect for that world and that Batman
alright you know that I guess that's
what I mean by perfect I think I also
really enjoy it but I'm not saying
perfect in that that's the only Joker
ever because obviously Mark Hamill is
the only Joker ever but you can only
have one it's Mark Hamill yeah done not
even a question
may you know may-maybe dark ham mark
maybe dark camel maybe dark hammer don't
just just don't may maybe if we can be
choosy
I'd want Mark Hamill to have a little
more of an edge to him Arkham games the
aircrewmen yeah our comedian sorry he's
already he has already done it boom
there you go then we're fine then we're
fine
see our camel yep buddy I'd overall I
don't really don't mind Nicholson's
Joker it's for the time as I barf that
out for the time I think you know Heath
Ledger and Mark Hamill are two fantastic
examples of two very different takes on
the Joker and both of them nailing it
Heath Ledger is an interpretation and
Mark Hamill is just iconic well but even
Mark Hamill it's very classic Mark
Hamill is very classic Joker Joker but
it's still an interpretation it's still
ours Taylor on the Joker you know did it
died oh no and you know like there are
things that that you know pop up on the
on the web about like Heath Ledger's
like people are still discovering stuff
about Heath Ledger's performance to this
day and I think that's fantastic oh you
might went out there gonna know what
games we have on Steam just a whole
mouse topper organ oh yeah like for
example I was I was reading that a nurse
or not a nurse like a psychiatry student
was watching The Dark Knight and noticed
that Heath Ledger is constantly licking
his lips like Visio he's like he's
constantly like futzing with his lips
and licking his lips
yeah because antipsychotic medication
gives you dry mouth
and so like there are some people who
think that that was an eric turquois
that he made like oh i would be taking
it you know who was doing this the Joker
Heath Ledger's Joker clearly wouldn't be
taking his medication but if you if at
one point he was he might have dry mouth
so the Joker would not be thinking
anyway though and I guess the point the
moral the story is Heath Ledger's
performance is something to be admired
that's really dumb now it's fun it's fun
it's not necessarily true but it's fun
right let's see what we got here we got
future Prez jr. beam who says hey guys
last night in Vegas and watching the
stream instead of packing how is Dan dan
Wilson's latest money-making scheme
going capitalism ho he's just gonna
force me to perform but you give me
nothing to work with you do nothing you
literally give me nothing to work with
him and just say Dan Wilson makes Mecca
just pull something out of my ass dance
well god damn it fuck you you think I am
some kind of magician
fuck off Oh Dan's been taking his
medication so he's a little subdued
today nailed it rich nailed it
pork sandwich nope dildo swaggins says
hey guys have you seen the Lego Batman
movie I think it's a terrific take on
the character of Batman as well as his
relationships with others it's also
absolutely hysterical check it out if
you haven't it's adorable I've seen it
you know it is adorable yeah it is
adorable
it's it's you know it gets a little
weird to me like the fact that you know
the enemies from different worlds thing
is a little strange but it's it's still
cute it's a very cute I think Michael
Cera as Robin is wonderful and just a
million great jokes
that's scene where Michael Cera is
picking out his costume and he just rips
his pants off so he has the classic you
know Robin Green Underpants it's great
great jokes like a Batman
I have not seen the Nathan Fillion
Uncharted fan film
have you seen slash heard of this why
would I ever look go out of my way to
see this
you don't care about Uncharted you also
don't care about Nathan Fillion so I
care about Nathan Fillion in general
because I'm a Firefly fan uh-huh
and so that came across you know my
newsfeed is he made an uncharted fan
film which you know everyone's like oh
how funny he made an uncharted fan film
that's that's really cute but to me it's
just like what a that's sad like he's a
professional actor you gotta get paid
for that like that's that's just a no
that's a hey make this movie Ain you
know who would be great to star in it
that's why I really want to start an
uncharted movie Hey look at this
attention I'm getting with my fan film
for this game that everyone likes that's
why I saying
I bet you need a lead actor for a movie
about this popular game look at me
I'm Nathan Fillion that's why it's a
little sad to me yeah yeah he's trying
to pull a Deadpool whoo yeah yeah is
puffy Nathan Fillion well if you got the
movie prior you probably have to work
out why we'll watch it it is on my list
of things to watch well I want to make
this movie right right yeah it's gonna
be a movie about this thing that's
already a movie it's gonna be it's gonna
be redundant horribly redundant we're
getting a them Fillion to start it
because it's kind of pathetic I feel bad
for him like some got a sick cat or
something after he's done cleaning your
pool you can star in your uncharted it's
gotta be like a double movie we're gonna
make a movie based off on the movie
that's based off of movies it's
brilliant done brilliant be like having
double vision
we'll make a game based on the movie
it'll be the first Uncharted game so
have a game based off of the movie which
is really based off of a movie which is
based off of other movies I love it
doing a great job Sadie I need something
to work with you can't just say dude Don
Wilson a concept underlying concept and
by the way like I don't mean to I don't
mean to bash on Nathan Fillion I think
he's fantastic I enjoy him as an actor
and I'm sure he's a good guy I have no
idea but but what I'm what I'm from an
outsider's perspective it seems strange
that that's someone who is a
professional in the industry would go to
such lengths just fashion about it man
he loves Uncharted and that that's very
possible that could be possible I could
be reading this incorrectly but it
strikes me as cynical know that it's
cynical I don't know that I'd say that
it's it strikes me as calculated
transparent is the word I would use
we're not a fan film and so it's an
audition yes yeah oh uh there we go
that's a fine way to put it it's a very
expensive audition
what
Oh fuck's happened I I got killed loan
that guy wasn't dying well that guy
wasn't dying yeah well that guy wasn't
dying I got killed
yeah Ryan Reynolds love Deadpool he did
but that for you know that was the
talking point out of all the Deadpool
stuff that was always the talking point
is how much of a fan Ryan Reynolds was
of Deadpool and I haven't seen that with
Nathan Fillion and his love of Uncharted
or he's just a big fan of the games and
so he thinks he can do it you know like
I said to me it's a little it's a little
cynical but but hey it's fine
okay pork sandwiches hello gents I
watched Billy Madison and happy gilmore
today for the first time and never
laughed once did mr. Sandler hypnotize
America yes he can only be funny the way
people think Jerry Lewis or mr. bean is
funny is being absurd the same as being
funny first of all mr. bean is very
funny I don't know why you're bringing
mr. bean into this mr. bean is very
funny have you seen everyone watch mr.
bean I've seen a little bit of mr. bean
here is very funny he's very funny I
don't seem like the movie or anything no
no just the show so first of all leave
mr. bean alone leave mr. bean out of
this secondly I have a fondness for
Billy Madison and having a terrible
terrible fondness
he's been lobbying to be nathan drake
for years if not decades maybe this is a
known thing about him jack i mean it
could be that it could be a known thing
about nathan feelings
I'm not I'm not generally the the
cynical one but I as soon as I saw like
the newsfeed come up that he was
starring in a fan-made Uncharted thing
that's the only thing that went off in
my head was this is just this is just in
hopes that he gets cast well no shit
yeah I mean I think it's obvious to
every literally everybody right and to
me that that's ours it that to me that
that me that then you can only see the
cynical side of it is it cynical when
it's so obviously the case
well cynical about it you don't need to
be covert to be cynical he's doing a
thing to get a part in a movie that
there's nothing there's nothing
what's cynical about that he's doing a
thing to get a part of movie okay right
what's cynical about that that's what
I'm that's what I'm curious about right
now the labeling of this is cynical the
the way it is being portrayed is that
you know this is this is just you know a
fan film being made out of love for the
franchise when it is clearly not as he
said that that that's like that's when
you where's that what idiot blog writers
have said about so that's the the
headlines of the news feed yeah okay you
can't blame him for that
people who write news feeds are idiots
these days this is all I'm saying
I don't think it's sénéchaux is showing
the dumbass to do that he can pull it
off
yeah but that's what he has like an
agent for Tim it to me
the the cynicism lies in maybe his agent
told her to do this that's mommy's agent
said it worked for Deadpool you gotta
make a fan film yeah yeah give him a
test you don't see what you can do or
how perfect oh and see like to me that
would be Fonz agent is Don Wilson they
say of course is a genocidal awesome to
me like that that would all be fine
where if he go if if he just says like
Oh like if the story was Nathan Fillion
thinks that he would be such a good
what's his name Nathan Drake that he
made a movie to prove it like boom all
cynicism is quashed he just made a thing
to fear that he could be good I care
about what he said not what that not the
headlines that morons are writing I
don't know what he said okay I do not
know
Jack you're B I'm being cynical right
that's what I'm saying I think the
original diehard would be a good premise
for a video game you ever played the old
NES tie hard no I actually loved it yeah
yeah I've heard it's absurdly hard no I
know it's hard it's not absurdly hard oh
okay
it's short look there's I've never
played it there's only 33 enemies in the
game it's like an accurate
representation of the number of enemies
it's like compared to what there were in
the movie nice excellent I think it's I
actually think it's interesting okay
didn't it have a thing where you could
actually like lose health by walking on
broken got health speed your foot your
feet have a separate health meter okay
so if you walk on broken glass that goes
down real fast you have to you have to
find bandages for your feet yeah that's
great that's great
you know the general rule is and you can
make it good anything out of anything
right oh I'm just moving quick I thought
you were aiming for an enemy I mean no
but hit the edge of the railing
there's diehard PC game released called
diehard naka Tommy
nevermind Plaza it was a first-person
shooter
well didn't they make a die-hard
first-person shooter for consoles as
well it was like after the Max Payne so
of course it had bullet time of some
kind of big yeah they made it die hard
for the consoles diehard games there's
been our arcade game but the idea could
be really neat
an original die hard movie where you
know you have just free reign over the
building and you got to set traps you
have limited health and ammo and you
have to you have to do what John McClane
does you have to you could do it in the
style of like a survival horror yeah
where you do kind of want to avoid the
enemies for the most part mm-hmm you
make you make the whole tower open-world
you know you can go anywhere do anything
and then you know and then you make it a
little adventure game II where you find
pieces over here Adam over here and and
that's how you can trap the elevator you
have to find a way you don't you don't
necessarily have to do it the same way I
did in the movie we had to find some way
to get the attention of the police yeah
yeah exactly exactly yeah they could be
fun actually that could be a nice small
game yeah you know you all you all it's
only one building that's it
[Music]
and save all the hostages right and
maybe maybe you don't maybe maybe the
first time you play the game a couple
houses die and then you have to figure
out how to play it again you know it
could be a short a nice short game where
you just have to figure out how to save
all the hospitals that be mad that'd be
actually a really good game
get on that someone who knows how to
make games
no not not an asymmetrical multiplayer
oh fuck off me no just make a make a a
nice short you know action stealth
puzzler thingy
it's not something that can be finished
in like five hours but is difficult to
get perfect and it's only perfect people
would bitch ammonia I like that kind I
like that style game short games that
are playable yeah but everyone bitches
and moans they think games have to be 80
hours long or their money's been wasted
fuck been ignoring that if you want to
replay a game five times that's as good
as a 20-hour game of course of course
not it's okay if you like longer games
but not every not every game needs to be
a long game I typically prefer the
shorter ones just personally and I'm
okay with I'm okay with either but you
know it's think about what your game
needs does it need to be 20 hours or is
that just your arbitrary is that your
arbitrary time because that's what how
long games are supposed to be alright
are you padding to get to that 20
but pork sandwich to get back to your
tip I really it's hard for me to comment
on because when Billy Madison came out I
was the absolute perfect age for Billy
Madison and I loved it I still love it I
think it's an incredibly funny and weird
movie damn it and I actually don't think
it gets as much love as it should
mostly because Adam Sandler has gone on
to make terrible terrible movies but
Billy Madison and to a lesser extent
happy gilmore I think are fantastic
comedies that I've watched several times
and enjoyed several times so
again I spawning all these guys in does
not want to appear or I can fucking see
him and kill him start and drive me nuts
oh there's a guy that spawns all the bad
guys these particular this particular
group okay you see the guy in the
doorway there
what about punch-drunk love well that's
not an Adam Sandler movie but I mean
obviously avatars fantastic and I think
Adam Sandler has a talent as an actor he
just you know would prefer to make a lot
of money in his in his rackets but not
Billy Madison is just a perfect
encapsulation of absurd comedy it's it's
such a weird premise it's a good pace
the jokes are very silly and oftentimes
nonsensical and all right Madison happy
gilmore was a weird one though happy
gilmore was the first instance of Adam
Sandler using a corporate tie-in as part
of the joke and back then we let him get
away with it because it was he's
breakdancing and that great just kind of
stuck there first of all he's really
good at that's the perfect rag doll yeah
can you knock him over what I want to
know I can't but yeah for anyone who's
seen happy gilmore there there's a joke
in it later on where he just needs he
needs money to you know buy his
grandma's house back and as a
professional golfer he he just does a
subway advertisement so like that's the
joke in the movie is that he does a
subway advertisement which was clearly
just a subway advertised yeah but that
was because that was the first time he
did it and really that was that was the
first time in movies were like he was
getting away with it because like the
joke was eyes you know we're doing a
sponsored thing in our movie but we're
pointing it out so it's okay cuz that's
the joke but then he just kept doing
it's art but I have a special place in
my heart for Billy Madison ain't happy
and I love them and Jesus has a special
place in hell for Adam Sandler no he's a
lovable huckster he's adorable
which I think you're supposed to do
somehow I'm looking at the chat I didn't
realize we had gone back into game mode
I I saw orcs riding on rockets and was
very confused
what a strange cutscene
puckster Jack Ewing conman say is not
the same thing isn't a huckster conman
yeah yeah but he's a lovable conman you
know why he's done some good work so we
can we're gonna let him get away with
with some of his worser instincts you
know to our knowledge he's never done
anything really horrible besides try to
you know build people out of their money
by watching his non comedy movies
he's not moving movies
but can you forgive pixels jack can you
I I heard like a lot of people were
really harsh on pixels when it came out
and I remember us just being more sad
than anything it was so clear that Adam
Sandler did not want to be there and it
was you know it was just a very like
it's not a good movie but also I don't
think it was the low point of anyone's
career it's just a bad movie it was more
sad than than terrible
pixels better than ready player one no
ready player one was just standard
uh-huh that wasn't super exciting what I
wasn't super offensive wasn't super
terrible also incredibly not memorable
yeah black members a lot of memorable
things borrowed by it right oh yeah
ready play was fine I think it was a
great example of Spielberg just kind of
making good out of nothing
Spielberg is just that talented it's
good man it's a good movie now Spielberg
didn't write it and he wasn't in charge
of those things but like I expect more
from Spielberg now if you just look at
the movie like we're talking about a man
who made a career out of elevating
schlock uh-huh he didn't elevate
anything and ready player one his losses
touch oh and see I think he did elevated
I think he elevated it to the point
where it's perfectly standard I think
everything in that movie screams this
should be horrible and Spielberg was
like now I can turn this into something
he made adequate out of horrible and
then he made adequate out of adequate I
don't know I think there was a there was
a lot that should have gone wrong in
ready player one and it didn't really
I I went into ready player one just
ready to cringe and ready to like have a
bad time and it was an alright movie so
I think that Spielberg's magic he made
it he made it an alright movie
I clapped when I saw the I enjoy yeah
I'm in the out it was filled with
garbage it was filled with so many other
properties that it had no identity of
its own that's a big problem because
like try to remember who the main
character of ready player one is what's
the that's the problem yeah that's the
major problem when you're when your
protagonist is is less interesting and
likeable than your side characters no
yeah maybe you shouldn't be your
protagonist maybe your focus is not the
wrong character yep yep how about this
so when your protagonist is less
interesting than his side characters and
the side characters are less interesting
than the things that they are writing
there's the there's a problem but that
being so like you would think that
should be a super garbage movie but it's
kind of alright
Mad Max look max is super interesting
super interesting
he's I like that character in fury road
I'm sorry I'm mr. flashbacks his arc
they did people who think max is nothing
character in fury road because he
doesn't he doesn't have the personal
stakes haven't seen a Mad Max movie oh
I'm not saying he's a nothing character
I I was I was saying super interesting
might be a bit like he's a good
character he works really well in fury
road and he's a good character super
interesting is what I'm I tried all
right he does a good job he serves his
purpose in the movie and he's a good
character
he's he's max he's he's maxed out for
himself and he gets caught up on other
people's crap absolutely that's that's
what max has done since after the first
movie yes oh yeah yeah
no and it works it definitely works and
I like I like that about Max the the
reluctant hero yeah yeah it's it's a
fine character to have I don't know if I
would call that super inter-high he's
all that I was my own Lancers I don't
want to be don't want to be you know
that yeah he's a good character so Jack
tell us about the Venture Brothers it's
very clever it's a very clever show I
think they're they're jokes and they're
the the way they they kind of create the
the mythos of the world as part of the
joke is very well done and very clever
that's what I'll say about The Venture
Brothers okay it's seen it seems like
the The Venture Brothers seems like a
fully established world and they're
playing off of that even though our key
our main character is kind of a schmuck
it
three generations of degradation yeah I
mention brothers hmm you have the I
guess the grandfather yeah
Jonas who was just super fucking amazing
and competent and everything he did huh
and then his son who is just a pathetic
version of his father but still has some
brains and then his sons were even more
pathetic version of their father yes yes
and then what I can only assume what I
will only assume we find out later is
that the the monarch is a is a brother
the creators have said they have refused
to detail why the monarch hates hates
dr. venture okay I assumed we would find
that out later know that we have not
found that no I based off of some
context clues I'm assuming that the
monarch is the brother that's that's fan
speculation okay that is certainly not
something that the creators have stated
okay man that's fair
that's and like I said it's all it's all
very clever I and the the jokes are
well-crafted I enjoyed that bit in the
garage sale where you know finally the
monarch you know the Monarchs having
some relationship problems with dr.
girlfriend you don't know the half and
and you know she's kind of she's lost
passion for the relationship because
monarch has obviously lost his passion
for being a villain but then you know as
big speech it's all rising and he poops
and ziplines away only to be revealed
that he was just waiting up there for
everyone to leave anything else that's
that's cute that's all cute
Jack doesn't know the 128th of it yeah
I've based off of the four episodes I've
seen it's all fine everything's fine
Jack doesn't know yet hate is a really
strong one
it is it is zonko hate is a really
strong word that I will
you know I'll save hate for something
like Batman V Superman or Suicide Squad
or you know like something that's really
really garbage something that like we
can demand for believe show the flaws of
here and there and I with the Venture
Brothers I think it's a very clever show
it's well written that I'm just not
particularly into yeah I'm assuming for
those who've missed this earlier in the
stream I'm assuming I'm not into it
because it is an older show and I've
already seen these jokes done and so
they're not as fresh to me that's what
I'm assuming they newer seasons when
they come out are still pretty strong so
I don't know that's the case well but
newer seasons come on they're strong
because you like the older seasons I
think they're legitimately good episodes
but there's no way you can know that
because you like the older season all
right and so you're you're kind of
rolling with the tide I think if I would
have started watching this when it first
came out I would have been a hardcore
fan I would have been a die-hard fan but
now it's like yeah I get it
fine
I need to reevaluate my tv-watching yeah
I'm good I'm fine I like what I like I
do I eat what I like man these Apple
Jacks they don't taste like Apple apples
the reason you don't like season 1 is
that it was written and meant to be a
straight-up Jonny Quest parody then they
got assigned for further seasons and it
became the show that people liked yeah
it's very possible it's very possible
but I think if you don't like ghosts of
the sargasso or tag sale you're right
you're probably just not gonna like the
show hmm it's fine it's all gonna be
fine everything's gonna be fine like 90%
of the time sounds like a high
percentage yeah I think so I mean in
general it's gonna be fine I think
having a positive attitude helps just
helps push through something you know
the negativity good slowing down and
having a positive attitude hours
true-blue review this is hey guys I
recently watched ashens
play dream quest nations play dream
quest okay I don't know what that is
it's known for having some of the best
gameplay and the worst graphics ever in
a video game if you like slay the spire
I highly recommend it it's really fun to
play even if it's hard to look at
come joshan's play dream quests that you
that sounds fake
that sounds like a fake thing
Oh ashen ashens is a person you just
watch out a person play the game dream
quests okay I'm with you I'm with you
true blur review I get it
alright I opened it up on my tab here
I'll look into it dream quest is a game
bad graphics good gameplay cool did you
say Oh fart I did say Oh fart
everything's fine I did see that CW
wants to make a Batwoman show yes having
they're having a good time making those
shows I've not I've not watched any of
my garbage CW shows in in quite a long
time there's been actually good TV to
watch there's been a lot of really good
TV to watch just look at you refer to
them as your garbage shows yeah they're
my garbage it's fine
we're we're making our way through
killing Eve right now what's that it's a
it's a really neat show about about a
woman Eve who becomes obsessed with a
serial killer
and then you know it's it's from her
point of view trying to catch the serial
killer and from the serial killers point
of view of being a serial and how they
interact with each other and they're
they they're kind of like obsessed with
each other and it's a it's a neat little
show
she cop she works for a British
intelligence agency
but it's a little under the Spanish
situation
so far it's good I only have a couple
more episodes alright you know I don't
know if it gets bad but I think it's
neat I think it's neat and the lady who
plays the killer is just is having a lot
of fun with it
she's very silly and having a lot of fun
Berry is also great yeah that's over now
season one's all done with berries a
fine show I think I saw that Henry
Winkler got a Emmy nomination for his
work on berry which is very well
deserved and he did a fantastic job on
there I was talking about a show called
killing Eve which is on BBC America
so much yelling so much yelling I tried
to I tried to slog my way through the
rest of Luke Cage because everyone kept
saying it got better and it got better
and boy did it not get better
nothing but potential there with that
Luke Cage show like that I like the
character when he showed up in Jessica
Jones the actors does a good job they
had some interesting villains and it's
just just just a bad time that Luke Cage
it's too bad about the overdose and
killing orcs cat person you have an
overdose I haven't you do have an
overdose of killing orcs you've been
that's what you've been up what did an
orca do to you recently would that you
feel like getting this is revenge one
game made me think of the other is what
happened basically okay
one game yeah oh I like it when you pop
their head that's yeah
I've heard of the I've heard of the show
called the terror which I know is
supposed to be very good have you heard
of the tailor no it's it's like the new
Netflix show I think that's supposed to
be really good that's the this the next
one you're supposed to watch did you
ever get around to dark the German
sci-fi thingy I don't even remember
hearing about it oh man it was great
that one's great don't watch it with the
overdub though watch it with subtitles
because the overdub voice I think is
terrible
dark is great and the terror is supposed
to be the new one that everyone's all
into that's the new show to watch the
terror is AMC oh shit I might not be
able to watch that then I gotta fit I
have to figure out if I can watch that
always subs never dubsy you know I
wasn't ready sometimes sometimes I want
to read a bunch of shit yeah
the problem the problem with subtitles
is it takes your eye away from the
visual splendor that you're supposed to
be enjoying yeah and sometimes there can
be good overdub dark is not one of those
cases though it's it's almost
unwatchable with the English over them
maybe I'll just wait for the American
remake fuck it as Netflix there's no
guarantee they're gonna do the American
TV I don't give a fuck this isn't this
isn't your mom's corporate television
where they find this show that works on
BBC and bring it over to America it's
already here he already got it
what time we have good 8:40 okay we are
at 8:40 rich we stuck we're about so
we're about three hours in woke up
getting tired of killing larks
oh that okay that's fine if you want to
enter early we can I have a bit of a
hand situation at the moment yeah my
hands are hurting Chad don't worry about
it it'll be fine in a couple days see
how quickly I can go to the next chapter
okay the game there's gonna be a
broadchurch American remake what god
damn it James I'll Cameron are you
serious well it's great that could be
[Laughter]
but broadchurch is already great why do
we need an American it already exists
and it's already great and happened with
the office American office is great
pretty stuff is great - yeah I can't get
past the accent I can barely understand
what people are saying half of the time
they do talk very fast yeah the damn I
wash it like the first what episode up
nothing's wide and it was pretty much a
straight remake you know the American
first episode pilot is like the same
story I still had trouble following it
oh the remake was called GracePoint the
I guess the the only problem with that
is broadchurch is a mystery it's a it's
a whodunit
it's a solve the crime and so if they do
an American remake is it gonna be the
same crime will I already know the
answer maybe they'll change it up maybe
maybe or maybe there's there's 299
million Americans who haven't seen
broadchurch they get a guy who can't get
out of them it's a good show David
Tennant's in it the doctors in it and
the new doctors in it 99 million two
hundred ninety nine million Americans
don't know who the fuck
David tinnitus that's also very true he
was unable to pivot in American movies
he was that guy in the filled Fright
Night reboot right that's right he was
also in some Harry Potter movies okay
they would know him as that guy from
here okay okay so you know it already
aired a few years back what is it you
guys you guys character what he's also
the purple man in Jessica Jones yeah
though I don't know how popular jessica
jones is it's hard it's hard to know how
popular things are outside of your
circle of fans honestly most people who
know what jessica jones is probably know
he was dr. who
yeah exactly that's what I'm saying and
so like the the all the Americans who
don't know who dr. who is probably don't
watch Jessica Jones oh shit okay so what
I'm getting I'm getting some news here
it was called grace points and Tennant
played the same role he did on
broadchurch in the American adaptation
and it came out in 2014
what the fuck never doing it again and
again and again for all time forever and
ever
app stop the time all right hold on I'm
looking up I'm looking us up grace
okay this sounds like the exact same
crime too by the way
I might have to watch a couple episodes
I might have to watch a couple episodes
to see how summarize how interesting
fuck I didn't even know that I was
playing it it exists GracePoint already
exists David Tennant plays the same role
in the remake how often does that happen
it's an interesting question I don't
know where an actor gets to reprise his
role in but everything else is
completely remade this is that's
insanity to me
it
oh okay
people are pointing out other roles in
which they've reprise the in the remake
Vanilla Sky the Tom Cruise remake had
vanilla Penelope Cruz reprise her role
Burt Reynolds is in the Adam Sandler
remake of The Young longest y'all
putting the same character is Burt
Reynolds playing the same character
because I think Adam Sandler is playing
the Burt Reynolds role right
presumably okay someone else presumably
someone else's sure sure
yeah and so anyway
just interested in people playing the
same role in the remake like they did a
they did a what was it like a German
movie version of The Girl with the
Dragon Tattoo and then like when David
Fincher did his movie everyone was
recast but one dude if that happened
they're like wow that dude must be great
no one else can play that role
[Music]
I got eggs but thanks hack bot thanks
beefcake I'm good on eggs just went
shopping
Swedish oh the Swedish version of Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo
or like what if they remake a movie and
only recast one person you're like oh
and wouldn't you feel terrible is that
one person who got recast yes you would
like Oh what did I do
I run the entire yeah it's probably time
to stand up but ya know we gonna end a
little bit early I want to I want to
make it to the plot twist there's a plot
twist so what's your mission now what's
the plot now we had to get to the secret
psychic weapon that will kill all of the
works okay great so that's probably not
gonna work right
there's a psychic weapon that will
destroy all orcs yep
and the plot twist is you fall through
the psychic weapon and become a
magician's apprentice not quite o demons
invade because this is fantasy that's
the guy who's telling us to use the
weapon is secretly possessed by a demon
nice nice
the Swedish girl who movies are really
quite great al-quwain a really great
quite bleak another the books are very
my wife is a fan of the books the David
Fincher movie I think is very beautiful
though I mean like it's very beautiful
it's just you know I don't understand I
don't necessarily understand what the
hype is but the story it's just just
kind of a little simple little mystery
story beautiful no I haven't seen I was
beautiful and horrifying beautiful movie
strange though strange movie not uh not
uh not a because she has a dragon tattoo
she well one she has a dragon tattoo so
you know spoiler alert - i-i've seen
arguments that the girl with the dragon
tattoo is a five act movie okay yeah
generally we think about movies as
having three yeah yeah and you know
because most do but the girl with the
dragon tattoo is actually an example of
a movie with five acts and so it's a
little it's a little unusual like like
the the the movie you know like has a
plot to resolve and it gets resolved and
then there's an extra like 15 20 minutes
of the movie where a whole different
plot thing gets years old okay and and
so it's a very unusual movie to watch if
you're if you're used to solid three-act
movies
but it's and it's also just gorgeous
it's a really it's a really good-looking
the cinematography
and some of the best some of the best
examples of of sound design elevating
elevating moments for anyone who's seen
it without spoiling anything the the hum
of the the floor buffer during that
horribly grotesque scene it's it's
venture right its venture so it's
beautiful
okay this is it you're opening the
portal or close I have to go do one
other thing upstairs but yeah these were
floor buffer was it a vacuum cleaner
that was a floor buffer
I know I plugged this a bit before but
if we ever play it again I'll know where
I left off and I'll just finish it up at
some point yeah like this is this is two
streams of this game and you're giving
all the viewers blue-ball starting to
start in the Canada oh I know I
shouldn't do that
yeah oh that's right Mecca the the The
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo also had the
score done by Trent Reznor really yeah
and it's good and it's good and weird
and just the right kind of it's you know
that's great okay that's great you know
you know what yes great it's fine now
it's a fine movie it's I I was just I
was very taken aback because like I said
the story is very basic and I was
expecting a more uh kind of a deeper
story but everything else about the
movie is so good it elevates it all
except for of course like I said the
five act structure it's worth a it's
worth a watch just to kind of be off
kilter storytelling wise
No
rich have you ever seen the time travel
film climber nope
no I also have nothing I know that's one
that we're all supposed to watch like
primer is famously a sci-fi time travel
movie that had like a five dollar budget
okay okay I was thinking of the one with
the Bruce Willis and what's his face
from looper your Weber looper which I
haven't seen either so I you know I
haven't seen looper either looper is
supposed to be really good I didn't see
it unfortunately but primer is supposed
to be this incredibly intricate well
like researched and written time travel
movie that almost makes no sense because
it makes so much sense if that makes any
sense
no that doesn't make any sense perfect
great but also done on an incredibly low
budget did you kill all the orcs no I
didn't call the orcs are still there
what no
my favorite film trilogy is the the the
view askew naver's trilogy yeah
clerks Mallrats chasing amy there take
that dinguses what is that huh trilogy
the view askew diverse how is what they
call it the the the very first cinematic
shared universe was Kevin Smith's clerks
Mallrats arguably well it's not the
first first meeting Universal Monsters
yeah today today you have crossover I
guess they Dracula Meets The Wolfman
shit like that
[Laughter]
alright you joke about it I think the
view askew verse counts no I'm not
joking about it it absolutely counts
chaos demons how does he know what they
are right away was there a thing in this
universe
presumably Space Marines are well taught
and versed in all the things they're
asked to kill sure look at that guy yeah
it's a letdown though the boss panels
fucking QuickTime event they really I
like this game
but they really fucking drop the ball
there oh yeah like he looks great yeah
he looks ridiculous he looks like the
kind of character who he should not
physically be able to move just because
his armor would get in his way all the
time right
[Music]
he's the traitor look at his arm yeah
yeah like a little robot arm I think one
of the the space brains has a robot arm
to bill the old guide the bird face huh
that's always fun
I like robot arms
is this a good entry point into 40k I
guess it is if it's really the only 40k
game I've played well it looks just like
a good shooter I know a bit about 40k
just like osmosis and curiosity I'll go
like read up on are the wikipedia pages
about it like what's a space brain
what's all that about I'll look it up I
start read about some of the lore sure
sure
like if you don't so I think it's fine
but like aren't the other games are like
realtime strategy games right well
mostly it's a tabletop board game right
yeah an expensive one because I'd know
they charge insane amount of money for
the little models like I have Blood Bowl
which I think also takes place in this
universe which is a tactical football
game probably not this universe it might
be yeah chat does Blood Bowl take place
in the Warhammer universe
check out the space home I haven't
played space home
I have played up a knock off of the
board game version years ago no somebody
made a video game version based on the
board game change just enough alien
assault or something okay so here's what
they're saying rich blood Bowl both
dozen doesn't take place in this
universe okay it's part of the Warhammer
Fantasy universe okay not the Warhammer
40k universe so yes end them
but I guess what like the point is it's
like if you think you'd be interested in
it and you like shooters like I thought
you play the shooter yeah or if you like
real time strategies play the real time
strategy game yeah alright so you want
to leave it off here then sure sure we
can do that calling a little early
tonight my hands hurt I know got a
couple more tips here we got thirty kids
there's as I rich and Jack I was
watching old TV shows such as Penn &
Teller bullshit and Ali G both my
personal favorites during the college
years presuming that you watch these
shows what did you like I've never seen
Alan GI like bullshit yeah but it's
great yeah
bullsh it's fun I don't know wait what
do you mean like what do I like what do
I like about them I just think bullsh
it's just interesting Penn & Teller's
bullshit oh yeah well it's fun and you
know like a lot like a lot of Penn &
Teller stuff they they do a really good
job of explaining the thing behind the
entertainment and or the mystery or the
whatever Ali G was fantastic is
fantastic you've never seen any allergy
no oh it's I mean it's it's just dumb
people being dumb and it's so the end of
your tips are Turkish says what did you
like about it and why will there never
be in another Ali G today he has a new
show out and it's already making waves
Sacha Baron Cohen has
new ally G type show where he dresses up
his characters and interviewed people
and he all liked the first 10 minutes
came out and he's already getting
prominent people to say ridiculous to
him it's amazing it's amazing the people
that fall for the shtick because they're
so used to a certain narrative his new
show is what is Sacha Baron Cohen's new
show called who is America thank you and
Ark his new show is called who is
America it's gonna be in Showtime and
it's gonna be another one where he
dresses up as characters and makes
people look like idiots mm-hmm so it's
gonna be great it's gonna be great and
Penn & Teller still do a lot of work I I
like there um what's their magic show
their fool fool me fool me that's young
I've seen it like have you ever like
just watched one of their magic acts
that seemed live someday they're great
they have they have a standing thing in
Vegas when I was there a few years ago I
got to see them live and they are
fantastic yeah I've seen them do magic
on TV but I've never straight ups like
been to their show or something I I
really recommend it it's a good time
they have and I want to say they have a
standing gig yeah yeah fool us not fool
me fool us sure sure
so anyway so there's gonna be a new
allergy and Joe kitty 0:01 says the
mimic the lurker above the trapper the
stun jelly the piercer gasps spores use
these monster traps Jack I got a mimic I
got a mimic in mind and I have a my new
D&D; adventure has a long detective II
thing I'm stealing wholeheartedly from
witcher 3 because my boys have been
watching me play witcher 3 and they
really like the the detective ii you
know the detective vision parts
they like it like you know like oh I got
to find this monster I'll use my Witcher
sense and oh there's some footprints oh
I smell them now and I follow this so I
made a whole mousetrap root for them to
follow all the clues to get to the
monster yeah yeah so like I have
everything sadden but they want to play
their own games Oh terrible my children
have found something little they love
and enjoy that was a joke obviously and
their their creativity is getting in the
way of your creativity geez check you
know you know you got to do jack what
yeah I just beat the shit out of them in
Smash Brothers
knock knock them down a peg just just
keep knocking them down you know play
Smash Brothers with them but you know I
do it fair one on one yeah show them
who's boss no more there's two on one
garbage it's gonna be great it's gonna
be great
no sound like I I have my next mission
all planned out they they have to you
know after after they go on this monster
hunt quest I have a mimic I actually
bought I found on Etsy someone like
handmade a little mimic thing and so I
like I have one that's just a treasure
chest and it just looks like a treasure
chest but then as soon as they get close
I'll swap it out for the treasure chest
with teeth the mimic right and they've
never seen that before so they are gonna
shit their pants it's gonna be great are
you gonna have something a clue that
what does a mimic and what isn't
yes my idea is if you know because it's
gonna be in this cave right yeah and so
my my thought is if they roll perception
if they roll a high enough perception
I'll start giving them some clues but
they'll have to they'll have to look for
cuz that's a big deal being is like
scanning the room like look around right
right and so then like you know maybe
maybe like if they roll high enough
perception like they'll hear breathing
or something or like a soft winds
blowing you hear some squishy noises
yeah a lot of it you make you kind of
make up on the go but yeah if they
I made a radius around it and so like if
they're if they're within this radius
they'll be able to you know hear
something if they're in this radius
maybe they'll smell some okay yeah
and so yeah I have that working out I
have this this little church like the
Church of this group that that wants the
skeletons to rise and they need to get
through the church which will have a bad
guy and then there's a tunnel into the
secret lair where they can destroy the
thing that makes the skeletons come
alive does he just want his wife back is
that why I want skeletons the bad guy
does he have a motive that's not just
I'm a word cultist that's wrong no I I
mean I can I'll probably make something
up but no I didn't think that far ahead
I know they're just a weird cultists and
they want the skeletons okay they
worship the skeletons that's all I have
I'm writing for 10-year old so I'm not
super worried about deep characters but
good mimic thing is unnaturally clean in
a cave like dungeon so like the cave is
unnaturally clean like that why would
that be for a minute because it's a
living thing and so would keep its
living quarters quasi clean most animals
usually do that most animals don't shoot
with a okay okay there's what I would
say to that but they often the the other
cave is dirty but that chest is super
clean oh I get it I get it
the mimics so like the cave is super
dirty but the treasure chest looks brand
new that's a good hint I like it I like
it I like it you guys yeah no no we're
doing the timer thing where you know
after so many minutes more skeletons pop
oh yeah and we just gotta find a day
it's gonna be great it's gonna be great
everything's gonna be great all right

of the week thank you
but tummy giggles who says an important
question guns or thorns you probably
rather have a gun in most situations
why not both sure sure why not both a
gun is good for any situation further
away than 10 feet but within that radius
I you know there's a lot of quick
movements the Thord might be better you
have two characters in a moving
antagonist protagonist yeah sword sword
fight might generally be better for just
like a fight between two people no no no
I suppose she's just peeking around
corner and take a chance at each other I
don't know yeah then then you got a
sword I think for a lot of situations
the Thord might win okay but that is an
important question you're absolutely

sermon one Miller wrote to a bar bus the
dog who says wrecking ball hype 724 the
balls are Unleashed he's talking about
the new overwatch character which is
literally a hamster in a giant ball are
they you're purchasing their conga line
oh wait they might be I know I mean it's
a new character actually he looks very
interesting yeah he looks very very
interesting but I mean like literally
he's a hamster in a giant ball it's not
a joke no it's not a joke
is a hamster and a ball but you know
like it looks interesting because you
have two forms like one you can just be
a ball and roll around and hurt people
like that but then you don't have any
guns but you move pretty fast and then
you can stop being a ball and have guns
and move pretty slow but he also has
like a Spider Man type mechanic where he
can like grapple on to stuff and then
he's literally a wrecking ball like you
can swing around and hurt people okay
it's a very interesting new character
and if I were still playing the game I'm
not playing the game anymore
if I were still playing it I'd be
excited about it it might be enough to
make me redownload it it might be enough
but yeah it's getting conga line we're
like 9/10 the way to conga line already
