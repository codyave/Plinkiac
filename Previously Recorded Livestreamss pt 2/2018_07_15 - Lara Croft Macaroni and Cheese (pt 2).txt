Crogatron says rich the game station
set is pretty great and you're probably
the one to blame for that was any part
of it reused for space cop which piece
did you work on the most I think it was
gone long before space cop MC Lucas says
if you want to play a game that actually
has challenging and satisfying climbing
mechanics that don't hold your hand like
this game try dying light it's an open
world zombie game but the parkour while
being chased in the is the real selling
point great stream thank you
yeah that's very came from there you go
wow there's shoot him in the head shoot
him in the head
you got him no I'm heavily ursus rich
thank you so much for introducing me to
me on Rome Aramis and all of their
wonderful videos and music are all nuts
I don't think I did that this is
something you know I don't know who that
is
Aurel nuts I don't know if I've ever
heard of that
okay I'm glad I could introduce you to
that thing that I'm not they streamed
the live commentary of robot jocks
earlier today on twitch and it made my
day okay
you did it rich I
that's how influential you are you're
you're introducing to people you don't
even know are they like subscribe to
somebody on Twitter who's pretending to
be me could that be a thing cuz everyone
knows you're not on Twitter
hey everyone rich isn't on Twitter
so if you ever see someone on Twitter if
you ever see someone on Twitter
pretending to be rich Evans it ain't
educated Twitter I'd never use it I just
don't have that kind of interest in
social media
so how how did you find the are all not
or is this all part of your plan to get
us to say oral knots as much as possible
because you are actually one of the oral
knots you sick
join me again great okay
you did it crap all the things grabbing
all the things Kevin the things from the
thing when you think thing thing thing
thing
Burger King Diamond sense many people
base their identities on externals when
one says I don't like what you like in a
way you're saying that you don't like
them I can be talking out of my ass
right people people need to get over
that man right just because we like
different forms of entertainment doesn't
mean that we don't like you as a person
I mean if you're a dickhead then we
don't like you as a person and the way
you're acting attacking us for liking
the things you like an entertainment
kinda just makes me think you're a
dickhead but get over it it'll be fine
everything will be fine all the same
but can we please see the shooting game
play at a higher difficulty ai looks
really underdeveloped / ineffective
playing at normal dog sure if I can
change the difficulty level give me a
second here but what I assume is the
difficulty level just means that all the
enemies will have more health and
they'll just be a bigger pain in the ass
they do more damage sure um hold on I
have an upgrade point ammo capacity yeah
that's a good idea more ammo great
alright oh let me go to the
sure added stock all right great
all right let's see if we can know the
difficulty for this game is great it
becomes a survival game no health regen
okay
combat difficulty all right I was on
normal I moved it up to heart we are now
on Hard difficulty
hockey fall off the log and hard to pick
up no shit
Oh should I wait I was scratching my
face I'm scratching my face no I had an
itch son of a bitch I do I have to redo
all that that's not very fun Oh
well satisfy my curiosity I'm probably
not but it just said combat difficulties
so um all this stuff is the same yeah so
now
sucks to be that guy shouldn't why this
instead of Detroit become human at least
you could make fun of that so clearly
trying to be a film no what I wanted to
play tonight
what Warhammer Space Marine that's gonna
be my go-to mm-hmm it's fun action game
yeah there's still kind of lame oh I
didn't kill him this time
okay yeah all right go uh you know and
that would have been fine you you you
didn't push hard for that no and and so
I don't want people to think that I like
shut that down no no I don't even bring
it up to you huh I didn't bring it up to
you
yeah you said you said oh maybe we could
okay you see babies and I said oh you
know I was thinking and playing this and
you go okay that's fine say I don't even
think I brothers so it's not like
something I fought for I didn't even
remember bringing it up right I just
look at that there's nothing Jack wants
to maybe there
where's everybody did I get it hello but
I thought you know screamed a good chunk
of that game before even though I'm in
the mood to play it yeah you know we did
and you played last time so I didn't
want to force you to play anything and
so yeah you know I mean this is fine
this is perfectly average and adequate
oh they're okay how did you how did you
get lit on fire
doctor move it up says add my local
paper for a cosmetic surgery clinic
featured a pair of bare breasts with the
nipples photoshopped out ah I find it
hilarious but it got me thinking about
where the line is drawn on what parts of
our bodies are acceptable what is
obscene societies proves society's
fruits that is true
society's fruit you know who was it it
was someone on Jimmy Kimmel Miley Cyrus
on Jimmy Kimmel really really cleverly
had to come out and she had like just
tape on her nipples right yeah and she's
like you know isn't it funny like I have
to put tape on my nipples even though
nipples are the part of the breast that
both men and women have you can see all
the other part of the breasts which is
the different part I don't have to cover
up the nipples and I was like oh that's
actually kind of clever
okay that's not idea what that guy knew
that someone said no health regen she's
been shot at least 40 times yeah someone
did say that weird it's almost as if
even on Hard difficulty this is really
easy like this guy's chase me
I'm gonna do it this dickhead how many
bombs I don't think I have any bombs
you know what the odd thing is our craft
is still underdressed it's always it's
nice to know that something stays what
do we got to do here rich what do we
think shoot a detonating thing behind
him I don't think I have it all wait I
was playing Warhammer
maybe I think he gets enough damage he
will drop the shield okay yeah I don't
think so he just said it he just said I
was waste Oh get him to swing and then
shoot oh oh shit nope you got me why is
the shield guy not carrying a gun right
Oh
press B to dodge I didn't see the prompt
there press B to dodge enemies and we've
been vulnerable to attack
that's alright dad fine
oh shit okay do-do-do-do-do where your
other little pickups over here did I
pick those up already
no I guess I got those are fun fact did
you know that an injustice to Robert
Englund voices scarecrow I did not know
that Robert Englund Freddy yeah Freddy
Krueger wait oh that's fun
yeah what it is a fun fact
thanks for sharing you know you see the
term fun fact gets tossed around a lot
nowadays but that actually is a fun fact
do-do-do-do-do that's unfair scarecrow
makes nightmares and then Freddie kills
you in them ooh
Oh pee or devastating combo yeah did you
ever play Daisy I never got around to
Daisy no no yeah no just you know me a
multi-player oh yeah I guess that's true
things yeah yeah and I never got around
to it I know it was it was the thing for
a while that's still one of those games
that that's never finished right I don't
I don't know if Daisy has ever had an
official release or not right that's
what I'm saying it's one of those it's
one of those forever in early access
like the poster child to to be warned I
know there was controversy with Daisy's
Russian knock off that was basically
cheating people out of money because the
game didn't work right or something was
some kind of issue with the game oh man
de zombie or something really weird
zombie Z days yeah some Russian company
that rush it out the door to capitalize
off of Daisy nice oh no I wanted to
commit Laura Daisy is a mod they start
making a separate game well then they
sell Daisy is a separate thing there
I thought they sold Daisy separately but
I could be wrong
I was was War Z the name of the Russian
one okay what the fuck were Z then some
other name
then they somehow got Romero to give his
name to them oh wow
love to see us play for fortnight
probably not go home you know what maybe
we'll be smart we'll start downloading
it like tonight and then one of these
days I'll bring in my computer again and
we'll play a little fortnight for some
reason when I play multiplayer shooters
I'd turn into an idiot I just turned
into an idiot better for entertainment
that's true okay what is going on here
like I kick ass it like like Friday the
13th that's multiplayer a kick ass of
that huh like it it's fuck
I'm decent I'm decent at rocket League
yeah but I will come when it comes to
multiplayer shooters I turn into a moron
I can't like it like an actual moron
clinically apparently I had to press the
B button a clinical moron yeah well good
then that's just good entertainment so
we'll have to do a test to see if we can
stream multiple things at once with our
idea to do so i I've launched like a
previous pub G stream we had yeah
there's a situation where I was trying
to shoot at somebody and just just my
being frazzled in the moment of it I
went back and we watched it I was like
my aim was off by like five inches well
yeah like the Blood starts pumping yeah
but I was like nowhere near the MARTA
you know but that's one of the things
that I really enjoy about multiplayer
games like that is it really does add
some tension even when you're not
live-streaming yourself yeah I like it
it makes like you're fighting against a
human and that's that ain't nothing it
really gets that blood pumping
I just never go watch from some old pub
G footage just being a Barrett
solutely embarrassed it myself oh yeah
well that's fun that's fun for people
watching
well well rich says storm Templar at
least you didn't shoot your partner than
the game thanks guys bunch of dicks
nope I'll wait it sounded like it again
get our green screens all messed up
all I'm doing is holding the up button
right now by the way okay
I'm not this is none of this is game
could you ever need to do that oh no at
this point okay at this point we're full
cutsie but for a while I did need to
hold the UP button
you shot rich in the back I thought he
was an enemy
III was being a quick quick on the
trigger because I thought he was an
enemy that was a you know that was me
not paying attention doctor move it up
sighs I also wondered at one point a
man's chest would be considered to
Seattle like what if a guy had breast
implants what his nipples need to be
photoshopped out or censored I but you
could see like they could show like a
fat man shirtless right that famous the
guy who famously took like a million
dollar bet to get breast implants right
here no this is on the half as I was a
while ago now ten years ago is an old
story but I wonder I wonder if they made
sense of him
that guy was on the man show did they
blur they did blur him okay his fake
breasts were censored yeah you know what
here in America we'd be a bunch of
prudes Anonymous is trying to make a
point poor laces
did you ever enjoy old cinematic
platformers like Prince of Persia no I
think that I think that's a joke Prince
of Persia had a story yeah but it was
still a good platformer no I think he's
in on the joke yeah a cinematic
platformer yeah I think he's bringing
that up cuz that famously had good
storytelling you know oh and I see that
as a joke okay like you know a cinematic
Mario game the gameplay was not an
afterthought in Prince of Persia right
and storytelling did not get in the way
of having another world and black throne
I never played the other whether that
like I played did I play another word
played flashback okay I don't think I
played into the world I often think of
modern action-adventure games as an
evolution of those not exactly
challenging but still technically
impressive and often fun fuel tanks
few things the thing is I don't I don't
think sands of time short changes you
when it comes to platforming
yay chat wasn't the guy who's lived in
another world the same guy who did
flashback they're usually sold together
is all I know
so I guess I would assume I've seen them
on sale together they are ok well
somebody else said no well yeah you got
three yeses so good enough for me
and then it's a fact
what about story-driven games like space
quests unless you solve puzzles yeah oh
my god
God hates Lara Croft
that was a rescue point yeah it got hit
by lightning twice
you do a pretty nice job updating her
face no shoots good I'm the old yo the
old core polygon model is good and I
thought oh my god I'm supposed to be
doing something I'm Stu I'm supposed to
be controlling my slide all right all
right doesn't matter
I risk an EVO says evening Richard Jack
hello
longtime fan of our LM in prereq we have
a new respect for you guys on these
streams been on to twitch streams myself
now and trying to carry on a
conversation and monitor chat is very
tough and our streams not nearly as fast
thank you
it you know I think a lot of people who
don't stream don't even understand just
just what I'm doing right now like
controlling the camera and the character
and trying to talk is is nutso and I
don't just doing two things at once I
get how that works
Oh
son of a bitch it's only truly nutso
when you talk play and read the chat at
the same time I suppose
oh it keeps playing her death screamed
even though I didn't die
how awkward
like this is kind of a challenge here
got a fresh jump at the right time it's
not the best it ain't the worst star
Harville says for real much respect I
have difficulty just playing a game and
scratching my nuts at the same time
that's why you get a control of it
vibrates star Horrible's get it under
there just by streaming I I have I have
a bare minimum of a ten percent skill
dip in every game I play yeah I agree
except maybe XCOM which is just now so
ingrained
well but also XCOM you can yeah pause
much fun time if you want exactly really
think about things there's you know
there's a couple games that I just kind
of have on pure muscle memory that I can
I can get away with you know streaming
and playing why don't you guys mention
star wars without Williams The Return of
the Jedi ending scene with no music
video and oral nods did that okay I
remember that video I just don't
remember what the hell did it
oh oh there you go as well as a six
episode parody season for the entire
first six Star Wars movies that is
amazing and hilarious oh great okay
yeah that uh remember the concept yeah
there's sound edit of the the last part
of Star Wars without any of the sounds
is great are they the the ones that do
the music videos without music - yeah
John Williams specifically yes those are
great no there's a series of like music
videos without the music or it's just
like all the sound effects those are
great the end of ET is super yes
yeah it's quietly walking into the ship
the clear sky and brought down rain
you know it's not rational Lara I can't
I get that okay
yes the guy David Bowie and Mick
Jagger's dancing in the street without
music is fantastic the turn down for
what music video without ya without
music is beautiful I mean that's one
turn down for what is a beautiful music
video no matter what it is but they do
it without music and it's just like
sound effects it's they do a Miley Cyrus
wanna I want to say CollegeHumor does
some huh but it's yeah they're they're
great you know what that is that's just
fun that's just plain old editing fun
plain old fun
oh that's neat you have to aim while
upside down that's it not that whose
before or after last of us I'm gonna say
before why is that a thing
hang it upside down while the things are
coming on yeah yeah okay I'm gonna say
this as before that's a no you know it's
a neat neat little way to now do I have
to spring the trap
yes okay
now
gotta go through those headshots can you
shoot the thing before you kill the guys
no no
eventually it just the cameras moved
over there oh yeah
now as neat
if you see the new tomb raider film to
be honest I haven't cared about Tomb
Raider since 1997 to be perfectly honest
right
so yeah yes me as well I also have not
seen the new tumor at them because I
don't really care about Tomb Raider
if y'all stream Coney Island seems like
the type of game you would get behind
we've ditched screen for neon that's the
the Satan one out it's Satan
yeah like corrupted computer game yeah
yeah yeah we did shrimp oh yeah I see
what I have to do
there was a Tomb Raider movie a new tomb
raider movie based off of the popularity
of this game
cover
cover third person shooter at its most
bland right there yep I can just step
away up pop downtown Oh pop back down
step away heal a little bit even on Hard
difficulty it's super easy to cheese
this thing
no thank you
hello thank you
you're fighting an army of toddlers with
guns
yep yeah that's kind of what it seems
like no object permanence III leave I
leave frame and I forget that I was
there also they're shooting guns that
fire bullets that don't look like they
can penetrate crates that look like
they're 40 years old you know it's fine
it's a fine race I don't know yeah I
figured that out thank you
game which do you ever play Solaris or
any 4x games I love me some Master of
Orion - I'd like to find a nice modern
4x game that doesn't have real time
sections for them ship combat wanted to
climb that
maybe I can do that from here
endless space - and the space - doesn't
have real-time combat
I'll check it out yeah there we go it
seems like every Forex game made in the
last twenty years is what is Forex is
that a style of game or a game I love
game developer okay first and for
Explorer exploit exterminate and what's
the other exit damn it what's the fourth
X Chad's gonna know yeah I know they're
gonna know I'm gonna feel bad cuz I
don't remember it yep expand that's it
expand your empire basically you explore
the area around you and you find
resources then your empire is gonna
grows you use this resources build ships
and you expand there are other
civilizations out there that you get
into wars with
there was this storm it came out of
nowhere
I called them here rough find another
way you wanna make a Star Trek game what
would it be there it would be cos or TNG
hey I don't necessarily know that I need
a Star Trek game you know and you could
make both you know like you make a
little a little FTL II
yeah with a ton more dialogue options I
think we talked about this where you
know like you make an FTL with more
diplomatic options
I mean they've made them I don't think
old-school adventure games are that's
like fine John refers to old-school
venture game they've made them okay
hey new you gotta look at FTL was the
perfect Star Trek game too much
exploding too much exploding too much
exploding that's fair
really really playing FTL right you
don't focus on the diplomacy that much
right because if you do if you play if
you play
FTL like a pacifist you're gonna get
your ass kicked by the the last end yeah
mothership absolutely
abso-fucking-lutely which which is you
know which is why it's not Star Trek the
game if there was a viable pacifism
option yeah then it would truly be like
a next-gen simulator yeah
and we we did the stream a little bit at
least a little bit of Star Trek at the
25th anniversary or venture game just a
little bit of it yeah fucking time
good stealth rich they don't see me
right as I made my good stealth joke
damn it I know now it's gonna be a clip
that will live on forever
oh no thousands of views Oh No
a monument to my idiocy damn it
another monument to my idiocy
and people tell me a leap forces a
decent Star Trek game but I don't I
don't get it
and I don't get having a Star Trek
shooter that just seems so wrong called
a mouse you should be using there wasn't
this much shooting before and now
there's more shooting what happened to
the other guy I guess he doesn't care
about these guys
yeah with a mouse that would have gone a
lot smoother yeah how these don't really
care that much
is that other dude where did he go maybe
he despawned he absolutely like there
was a third dude that went up here I
think he fell off the cliff
oh shit berries we're watching take the
zip one day apparently big shot too
what are you just run past him I guess I
could welcome I mean not literally
you think that's an option feminine
wiles seduction is an upgrade you get
eight if a to feminine wiles a to
feminine wiles yes they're very
distracted what ten points and feminine
wiles should you just flash your tips to
distract all the enemies for ten seconds
boom window boob window boob window get
some free shots really really broke the
flow of the game now really Opie really
Opie shit what am I supposed to go
do something
mama says clarifying my earlier tip
cinematic platformer wasn't meant as a
joke it's the act actual sub-genre under
which the 89 Prince of Persia and games
like it were categorized 89 considered
cinematic anything that's weird
thanks for taking my money you're
welcome
that's weird
bullet scan is fuckin bore take true
blue review says speaking of flashback
you should take a look at the terrible
modern remake of it with the same name
what's worse is a bunch of gaming
channels got sponsors sponsored by Xbox
Live to play it in three other games
trying so hard not to say anything bad
about it that discussed the mating you
have that obligation man feel that feel
that need
you know it's fine everything's fine
madam says keep up the good work guys if
either of you played into the breach
yeah a little bit maybe playing on that
stream a little bit we did we did that's
good it wasn't mind-blowing but it was
good that's it that's the whole thing
that's the whole game yeah
not mind-blowing but decent doesn't have
that the same um same spark as FTL but
you know good and each particular runs
having a little bit too short and no my
camp is definitely not a Cubs cap but I
forget what they forgot what the team
name is called the minor league team
that plays a little bit north of here
we've got a fish fish themed team the
fishies the the guppy the fish fish I
don't know well they have a fish mascot
but miserly he has legs he didn't really
think that mascot suit yeah
I guess an independent league team that
really minor
oh well they they go stop it stop it
where am I going and what am i doing
lakeshore Chinooks Northwoods League the
lakeshore is so I believe it was
Chinooks yeah oh there you go college
level team yeah college level team
sports sports sports sports sports
wait I've been here already everything
I've been here already
I've got so many people are butthurt
over us not liking cinematic games shit
and you like you like this thing that
has some storytelling element to it
I have proved you wrong I am superior
all no no fuck them fuck them fuck you
fuck everyone welcome to the stream look
look no more heroes by suda51
doesn't look like anywhere near the
boring slob that this looks like alright
and I have been here before where am I
about rich was a Sox fan well well
fortunately the leg short chunks don't
play against the Chicago White Sox so
there's there's no conflict of interest
there
I went the wrong way somewhere around
here I went the wrong way okay they're
probably use this rope to get back up
right you let me do that no no you won't
let me do that
come on let me to that do that
why are you play games you hang jak1 did
you do you hate this no I mean it's
boring but I don't hate it
ok it's no lie I think you know I was
talking about this earlier and and I
really think there this is this is I I
know everyone talks about stuff like
peggle or or candy crush as like your
casual game but to me this is right
there with that we're like this is
something that is is mindless and and
this to me is a casual game and why did
you want to play this just answer the
other part of the closure uh just
because I've never played it and you
know the had no idea what the reboot
Tomb Raider was like I had no idea what
the reboot Tomb Raider is like oh
there's a new one coming out I know this
is a style of game that's very popular
right now to say you know what the old
go what the old one too right and you
know it's it's exactly the to me playing
this game does nothing to help me learn
because it's exactly what I thought it
was going to be what I was hoping is
like I had some preconceived notions
coming into this game that it was gonna
be a lot like uncharted a lot of button
prompt bullshit a lot of cutscenes a lot
of non game elements masking themselves
as game elements and I was right ok and
so I didn't really learn anything but
you know I played it now I can say it
played it so you know we got that going
for us
I was playing anything else tonight
Wow 9:16 probably not okay then probably
not
all right now I'm back outside
this is where I supposed to go
I went back down collected a bunch of
bullshit but I was supposed to go up
here
I feel like now after what three showers
I feel like I feel like we're finally
getting to like the meat of the game so
that's something like I feel like I'm
out of tutorial land how does this
compare to horizon zero dawn in horizon
zero dawn I could kind of do whatever I
wanted and if I wanted to ignore the
story I could just go hunt Robo
dinosaurs or like Ojai or like in
horizon zero dawn I could explore and
discover a new thing a bandit camp or a
thing of dinosaurs or a field of wild
berries this is a linear story this is
this is do the same thing over and over
and over again very very different you
know it's not to be fair Jack yeah don't
you do the same thing over and over
again in pac-man in Super Mario Brothers
oh sure sure a lot of games you do the
same thing over that's true that was you
know what that was a little too what is
it when you say something that that
applies to a lot of things generally
yeah that was a little too generalized
then I apologize for that
but you know it's it's fine this is all
fine it's just very linear which isn't
necessarily a bad thing because you know
some like doom is a linear game but doom
has emphasis there's a secret tune
nearby or you just submit this is a
different game from pac-man and horizon
zero dawn and you don't have to like
that but it's still a game it's still a
game but I mean I don't know I'm not
playing I'm not playing it mm-hmm it
looks like a fairly dull one yeah oh no
and like I guess that's what I was
saying is someone asked how does this
compare to horizon zero dawn and they're
very different games this is not an
open-world game okay this is a linear
game horizon zero dawn let me do things
like you know when when I had to tackle
a robo dinosaur right I got to figure
out how I best wanted to handle that
situation what you know what kind of
rope traps do I want to use do I want to
lay some traps out before the fight even
starts you know what sort of upgrades do
I want it let me do a lot of prep work
and handle and this looks like a lot of
you know mediocre third person at
gunplay yeah with with some boring
traversal you nail it this is an
optional - Oh waive Richards - okay
there is a tomb though let's do an
optional tomb that's like
what's part of Yamatai
oh shit this might be a puzzle
course I'm sure I got to do something
bad right
puzzle yeah yeah it's happening rich all
right it's all happening we have our
first puzzle how exciting
let's try that again now compare this to
gotta fall not of warhead fun combat God
of War had really fun combat
the shooting losing this looks really
bland
oh you know like for as much hack as I
give god of war that combat was very
satisfying this is nothing like God
afford to be fair it's similar in that
there there's some storytelling elements
and a lot of bullshit traversal it's
similar in that regard but the actual
beating things up and got a Bors quite
fun Michael oh yeah faster faster
which hates traversal confirmed yeah
fake platforming is boring
I should use my I should use my
detective vision okay we can mess with
that
saying why do you keep jumping off
jumping off this thing yeah
oh I was trying to jump up there
Jack you've solved the puzzle twice up
apparently shit
okay so apparently I just have to stay
on I thought this you know like this
would raise up and I jump on to that
platform
okay I see I see this will carry me over
into it
there are any 3d games besides Mario
that have actual good and platforming I
I might I might be alone in this but I'm
gonna throw out the Maximo games on the
PlayStation 2
máximo was hard I had beat it without
losing a lifetime
damn rich the first game I went out on
way to do that one because it was it's
relatively short mm-hmm and it's kind of
notoriously hard and I enjoyed it and I
noticed I was starting to get really
good at it and I'm like you know would
it be awesome if I could beat this
really hard game I'm one life wouldn't
that be awesome and took me forever to
actually do it
I should play maximal on screaming I
should it's a pain in the ass to bring
in the PlayStation yep I have to emulate
it I have to emulated market or just
bring in the PlayStation 2 how hard is
that right you just emulated I own the
fucking disc and PlayStation 2 oh that
was it oh one puzzle and I get a trigger
yeah I guess that's something I'll take
it I'll take it
skillpoint sure rich I believe you about
about what about maximal I think they're
I think they're trying to bait me into
yeah I stranded once I got like halfway
through the game before I just did
something stupid but I did stream it
once yeah he did
okay wait captain president thank you
for the donation that Eddie just said it
I'm just wanted okay I guess I could
read that it's not a big deal
not exactly a talking point either
though we've just made it into one isn't
that amazing yeah I know it's Talent
where the Tomb Raider games ever good
that's maybe we talked about that I'm
not sure they were you know that could
that could be a decent bit when the new
one comes out yeah no no wait wait is
not not playing the new one rich is just
playing the original okay and don't I
think about the original tomb Raider and
is this another is this another
situation where people remember the
character more than they remember the
game the character I really think the
fact that it was so early on the 3d
bandwagon helped it stand out oh
absolutely I think no doubt about it
I mean I enjoyed it at the time I don't
I don't necessarily know that it holds
up
I think it's entirely possible I could
play Tomb Raider one and just think this
did not age well at all and I think that
that could be an interesting episode
right there and you know we time it
right before the new one comes out and
that's what we call clicks motherfucker
people hungry for that for that Tomb
Raider content cuz I remember right at
least some of the puzzles were fairly
obnoxious find the hidden keys hidden
somewhere out of the way oh sure it's
not really not really a puzzle as much
as it was just tedious little fetch
quest sure did search every nook and
cranny on the thing yeah
okay
under one of their favorites of their
time just suck in general due to sands
nostalgia that's that's a lot of it man
that's just that's a lot of the world's
and I'm not saying for sure that's
what's going on but to later I'm just
saying I wouldn't be shocked if it
didn't know too well right I haven't
played that game of ages
to dust off the old playstation or you
can emulate it wait a minute are you
talking about piracy are you talking
about breaking the law
wildlife industry says why is nuance so
lost you can like a game and a genre for
reasons doesn't rain you you're a
hypocrite if you don't like every other
game and said genre I know maybe you
haven't been on recently the internet
says otherwise my friend the internet
says you must love something or hate it
completely I know what Jack you hate
this I did yes I uh
oh I'm so filled with hate great oh yeah
no I I'm gonna make a video essay
tearing this apart that's fine casual
casual horse this is casual horse should
have just played spaceman I know I like
that uh-huh
I don't want to be that everything all
the time goddamnit I'm not hating on
everything all the time saying it's a
fine game - finally it's astrophysics
Sunday stroll through the park just to
do last room is must I fucking loved it
fucking love that game yeah yeah I know
I did and what only one orc got through
yeah no but also one Orca got through I
know
drove me nuts when that happened yeah
Kobol must just slip through
pilgrimage
yeah no it's okay yeah I'm gonna you
played a game you really enjoyed and
everyone completely accepted that you
really enjoyed it and it was a great
time great time was head well
captain Jessa captain Jessa
mmm-hmm I feel another tomb coming on
this is very exciting
Jordanna says Jordanna
this is late in coming but you two look
lovely in 1080p thanks for all the
streaming goodness you sexy bitches shit
girl yeah hopefully everyone's enjoying
the 1080p you know brought to you by oh
god that was a person there
too many people all the peas where did
those guys come from I know I I have no
idea what's going on I have to scale a
mountain to get here and then all of a
sudden there were guys behind me like
they scaled it to oh and now there's
like ancient warriors shit oh that's
neat
a corpse pile
I'm gonna look that rotten where'd they
get all these people from like they
killed all these people at around the
same time and that's a lot of people to
just kill yeah yeah well that was dumb
Laura they just slaughter a nearby town
uh there's they seem to have acolytes so
maybe they're slaughtering acolytes yeah
I don't know I don't know if Ryan Island
or what I honestly don't know
I'm just curious man I'm just curious
you can't say you hate the Stewart story
how dare you how dare you I just thought
that was odd yeah I'm gonna I'm just
gonna say this is faulty our direction
is I'm guessing that the art director
just didn't think about it like the time
well you know there's a penny people
there's a couple skeletons I thought I
saw yeah like see there's a couple of
skeletons okay so you know but all the
corpses up there seem to be at the exact
same level of fraud
but look now there's like Giants Conan
did a clueless gamer on this and it was
glorious yeah most of his clueless
gamers are pretty funny you know what
Conan's pretty funny yeah good old Conan
oh cool odo yeah my limbs falling down
she's got to burn that outfit man oh and
by the way like she has got to smell
terrible at this point she was stabbed
in the abdomen yeah at the beginning of
this that's a pretty major injury yeah
and you can still see her stab wound
it's like right under her hand there and
now she's like been rolling around in
corpses and whatnot it can't have healed
properly no she's dead many times over
Oh horse bones too
this thing's don't walk
nice
I heard something like she's doing
acrobatics that horrible room oh no her
intestines should be spilling out of her
abdomen this just strains credibility to
its breaking yeah I just can't believe
that I cha
oh my immersion is ruined just ruined oh
come on come on Lera I hate to lose
someone someone thought they were very
clever writing that line
look miss Lora crop is presumably a
millennial right ah this is the mm no no
cuz this is this takes place like does
this take place now when does this take
place it seems weird that she's wearing
a digital watch
that's what stood out to me like wait a
minute I think this is supposed to be a
prequel so this might be taking place in
like the 80s I think she was 30s 40s
back in the day so I'm gonna say she is
not a millennial okay were you going
with she's a hipster wearing a digital
watch this one is modern the watch is
weird I'm assuming that's a very
specific like scuba diver's watch like
an adventurer watch like a very I guess
it makes sense if you're going out in
the jungle that you're not gonna rely
yeah all right all right I bet it has
you know some GPS depth that kind of
stuff like have you ever been to one of
those stores that like sells like
camping gear and you see all their crazy
watch shit no oh yeah it's like bigoted
nuts
doom it up
dooma dooma dooma dooma dooma tup
oh I'm Lara Croft mother Joker that's
exactly what I wanted my Laura Croft
game her running around of this shotgun
facing people that's exactly what I
think of when I think of Lara Croft
shotgun yeah I think the two pistols
yeah exactly that was dumb do that yeah
go ahead and swing that into the door
yeah you got it oh I know I just yeah I
was just captured so you know like
speaking of realism and games
I was just captured but they didn't take
away any of my guns or bows and arrows
okay so that's fine you know what all
right all right
Laura is a murder machine yes I just
like modern Tomb Raider I hate but I
love furiosa
does that count up dose is badass
furiosa is a badass upgrade my shotgun
Samus is a badass except for that one
time haha we just we just don't we just
don't talk about that one anymore
increase damage share increased damage
always good
there are bayonetta oh yeah yeah
certifiable badass
I like Bayonetta as a character I agree
oh I did not want to go to the I wanted
to reload my shotgun but thanks for
playing what one time I don't we don't
talk about the ones no no that's not a
we don't we we try not to mention the
other time if you get me
wink-wink nudge-nudge like Bayonetta is
a strong female character who uses her
clothes as she does combos look
Bayonetta embraces her sexuality and
revels in it absolutely and wraps men
around her finger she is a woman in
control of her destiny and in control of
her body and you do know Matt no man's
gonna tell Bayonetta what to do
damn straight damn straight no man woman
or child in fact she kind of hates all
of them even the child that is her or
something I actually forget her shell
was her from the past yeah
oh I rolled too soon
what what what what happened yeah shove
someone else I would do it was there's
other people in the room I was in the
middle of a killing me Kara they were
shooting you
I'm sure all the other people are taking
care of first
it's dum-dum shotgun I love it I love it
it's great you take your stuff and your
stuff and I think that's all the stuff I
see see what I have to do
you think the next Mad Max film should
be a prequel about Furioso
or some rumors last year that it might
be didn't didn't George Miller just flat
out say he's not doing any more he wants
to do more but there were some Lee Bill
and Ted there were some legal issues
okay they're there apparently there was
some money issues or some who got paid
for what yeah issues with fury road with
him and it might actually be the
weinstein company huh
and you know like who owes who what
money that kind of stuff but so yeah
apparently it's just one another one of
those situations where it might not
happen
I'm fine with they're just being fury
well I am too
I mean well fury road and and Mad Max
and the road warrior and I like
Thunderdome there's some redeemable as
to Thunderdome I think so look the
middle is boring but it starts strong at
an end strong
get it
being this life
in it
what am I doing here
yeah
say maybe opening run at a time
oh I see can I see what's going on you
alright
gotta hit the walls not the Bell
yeah yeah that's fair that's fine
perhaps your folks can help you all
these games not all these games felt
your focus I don't even know what they
call her sense here your Witcher since
your detected vision what do they call
it in this game her archaeologist vision
her PhD in two senses does she have a
PhD probably I assume so I know if she
has one here in free pool and oh oh shit
there's people here where did you get
hit with a stray oh oh you have a
long-range weapon why are you getting in
his face because it's more fun this way
you're playing it hard yeah okay sure am
playing on hard yeah how's this going to
cover it'll be fine
and now we're gonna do
shit I've got to get out of here that
bow should do it
I loot the bodies I don't
okay all right now okay now I bet I
gotta hit the behind so we're gonna open
this one it's so hard yes I am play
pumped it up to hard difficulty level
and I am it like more damage is being
done to me absolutely they don't seem to
be terribly harder to kill but more
damage is being done to me to be fair to
the game
and she's dead yep again
boss fight maybe or running away running
away nope supposed to do shit
that's having a debate on whether the
original Mad Max is the worst Mad Max
movie interesting but that was really
before it was a Mad Max you know it
definitely has a different feel to it it
is more boring er than all of the other
movies yes what that's words did
Oh too early talk about the best Mad Max
movie it's it's it's it's the Battle of
fury road and road warrior okay website
much like fucking adore road warrior
growing up it is s fuckin just totally
really is that movie is I gotta give it
to fury road right fury road is
beautiful yeah beautiful movie
everything about it is just the best and
by the way for those in chat we're not
saying that Mad Max is a bad movie
we're just saying out of all of the Mad
Max movies Mad Max might be the worst
it's still very good movies what
fury fury road does everything Road
Warrior does but better I think you can
make the argument that it just does it
differently fury road is is like a
goddamn painting it does not exist in
any kind of reality as we know it it was
beautiful and glorious hmm
and I think that doesn't mean it's
better than the road warrior because the
road warriors it's just different than
world warriors trying to be very very
gritty and down-to-earth it's definitely
a similar story but in a different style
did you hear recently that uh the story
about well how do i George Miller chose
the editor of the movie yes his wife to
edit here and and the wife his wife I
forget her name whoever edited fury road
she initially said no she said no I
don't want them edit your movie I've
never added an action movie before and I
don't think I'd be very good at it so
you know I don't want to edit your movie
wait I read this that's kind of by Titan
Creed yeah in the chat so so the road
warrior is a picture by a brilliant
photographer and fury road is a painting
yes yes a good way to put it and so you
know she she initially refused to edit
fury road she says you know I I don't
know how to edit action movies and he
goes that's exactly why you need to
you're gonna come at this movie from a
completely different perspective and
that's what will make it special and I
thought that was a really interesting
choice on George Miller's part
all right made it through a camp I'm
good I'm good ending here I risk that
pays off um yeah well you know I think
it's it's it's neat sometimes you have
to you have to you have to take those
risks and obviously with fury road paid
off mm and you know good for him for
being able to be in charge of his own
production where he could say my wife
he's gonna edit this Hey
he looked at his producers and he goes
you know what works for Lucas back in
the day everyone said shit you're right
absolutely absolutely
all righty tighty we'll do that actually
you know what this is something really
weird I'm gonna turn this back on for
everyone is it really weird that exit to
main menu is like the third option yeah
it's fine
oh no it's like it's fine but like don't
you think that's usually like at the
bottom yeah it's not it's not like this
isn't game-breaking by Annie oh I
thought you had to go like three sub
menus or something no they have that is
weird like reload Check Point exit two
main menu is the third that is super
weird right it should be like way down
here at the bottom anyway that's that's
uh it's just basically what I'm saying
now is because the exit to main menu is
the third thing down this game sucks
that's exactly what I'm saying
did we expect fury road to be that good
I was skeptical until like a week or two
before it came out yeah I finally
started just seeing enough like you know
this this actually does look good and I
had no strong thoughts going in yeah I
had no horse in any race I was just
ready for any move
movie and it blew away my non
expectations but you know I didn't I
didn't have anything going in so me if
I'm caught up here in the tips
absolutely absolutely
wet Sasquatch says hello jack and rich
longtime fan of our OEM and prereq and I

either through Steam we do but we got so
many fucking games your odds of us
playing your game Earl oh yeah but yeah
if you'd like to email it to us if you

debate on whether or not you can its
prereq at red letter media comm if you
can email us games or whatever
absolutely well add them to our ever
growing library of games sure but we got
a ton of fucking games that we haven't

button I did hit the button okay okay
dark matter would like to be witnessed

there I think we just I think you just
repeat witness the formal okay if I if I
remember correctly right he said witness
me and everyone said yeah so there's no
formal witnessing you know there's paper
or there's a religion to this there
probably is in their minds from universe
yeah absolutely
this is a religious the witness me is a
religious experience you give your life
for your God King to go on to the chrome
shiny afterlife yes their version of
Valhalla
absolutely they're very well might be
some ceremony to it any proper response
to somebody saying witness me yeah and
it's witness witnessed okay doom to
