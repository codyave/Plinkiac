as will an emotion haha will yeah you
know doesn't make any sense
nebulous that's I'm feeling very real
today I'm feeling very will today
she used to restrain anger that doesn't
make it an emotion you can use will to
restrain emotions sure but that does not
make it an emotion
an emotion is the thing you feel will
will is the thing you exert ruega see
what his super is
who said it's an emotion in the first
place of the Green Lantern comics I
believe don't they call the the Green
Lantern rings the colors the emotional
spectrum if you don't know I could just
seriously misunderstand Green Lantern
more anything's possible written by red
guy and the capped by red guy and cat
the beta phase is complete Earth's
defenses irreversibly compromised begin
the countdown
apparently because green is the middle
color it gets to not be an emotion
all right comics okay oh how about this
that's fine
ready here's my bullshit reasoning which
I'm guessing is in the comics somewhere
yeah that's why the other guys are bad
is because their only emotion you see
anger and vengeance that's only emotion
and will is trying to control the ocean
that's what the ocean of emotion and
that's whether the space cops you see
okay that's what I'm saying
okay that's the thing that I just made
up two seconds ago so I'm sure that's
comic lore of summer because that's how
a comics work if someone makes it up
Green equal envy I believe I pick up
shit through osmosis I really do it up I
believe envy and the Green Lantern ring
color is orange being positioned over
these major cities usually that's yeah
usually that's green but but they can't
they couldn't do that because it's
already will yes the usual green
emotions are green envy and leprechauns
the three major green emotions Oh God we
could turn Green Lantern comic book lore
into our own like homeopathy styles
alternative medicine remedies of course
we could well so people like color
charts look at this color when you're
feeling this way no no you can't sell
them colored charts because then they
would only need to buy the one chart
okay you need to sell them something
that it has to be replenished so they
can keep buying true that's true
get it together rich and so what we do
is we buy a jug of Aquafina water or
whatever right put the smallest amount
of green food coloring in it clothing
that's just the right shade it's a very
specific calibrated shade special dyes
need to be made to get your clothing the
right shade of blue that's not bad
that's not bad but then once they buy
the clothing then they don't have to buy
more clothes clothing wears out not as
much as medication medication oh yeah I
get a little bit oh and it is
frightening
more so like the YouTube videos of
people who actually think it's real and
like you know have their products for
sale it's like
but so like that's the genius part of
medication is whoa oh here's what we
need rich I got it yeah color audio

podcast which we transmit color therapy

develops an immunity to it so every
month we need to make a new podcast okay
but it but on our end rich it'll just be

sleep
sure it's supplemental oh oh you missed
zinc
maybe I really am a badass therapeutics
for knotek's and knowledge Asst hoho you
wins the fuck is Blue Beetle a DC
spider-man I kind of he's got he's got
an interesting storylines well yeah I
think so
you know it's it basically he's DC
spider-man where he's a kid who who
finds this alien technology the Blue
Beetle suit mm-hm and you know wants to
becoming hero but he's a kid right yeah
but there was a really neat storyline
with him where as it turns out the Blue
Beetle suit was the was a precursor to
the alien invasion
okay the alien species that that houses
the suit you see sends one suit in ahead
of time to to become a hero on that
planet to weaken the planet's defenses
wait they send a suit to weaken the
plants defenses well you know beat it to
it to to make a hero of the planet so
then you know the hero can do whatever
they want and the hero is just gonna
weaken the planet's defenses no the the
hero is gonna be trusted and so then
they can hit me with your super this
seems unnecessarily convoluted well if
it's comic books of course it is the
sound stuff was bordering on Scientology
oh yeah you know religions with a real
money will start any way we can get
regular donations from people rich you
know religion has it because they get
weekly donations right you come to
church you give a little money right
yeah every single week yeah you're
giving people an excuse to come in come
on hit me with your super yeah tax free
to shit
Audio audio acronym X is up is that what
we're going with stereo stereo stereo
chronometer stereo stereo acronym X oh
it's Terry economics yeah come on hit me
with your super-dee do Scientology is
more of a cult than a religion there's
not much difference and you know what I
think more people nowadays are skeptical
of any soup of any religious affiliation
than they are of quackery
people love quack medicine that's just
the trend I think that well yeah and you
know like if we're gonna future-proof
this enterprise quack medicine will
never go away
okay wait how do you know who she is
that's a great question rich
she's been hidden away this infant all
right all right you and I left Krypton
at the same time but the explosion threw
my ship off course
way of course you have an age today
hypersleep while you were growing up I
was on ice
I never thought I'd see family again
someone with my eyes didn't think
general audience were too stupid to
accept all tivities so much what do you
mean relativity why she has no age how
long five minutes I think that that just
requires another chunk of exposition
that they're like hypersleep okay you
know okay everyone knows what hypersleep
is that's in everything that's a sci-fi
trope at this point so it's just easier
to explain come on bats County
that's the worst part of quack medicine
appraised on the most desperate that's
true it's true and it sets up a regular
you know it's it's a little bit of money
every month and then you need this quack
medicine and you know it's not working
because you haven't paid enough didn't
it
sorry so she just paid a little bit more
you can get the really good crack
medicine then Andy Kaufman died shortly
after going through a psychic surgeon
wow that was well that was back in the
day when whatever disease he had was
fatal
so who knows where he went banner or you
know how good he wouldn't go many
generators we need to reactivate that
console before Superman powers up damage
I was over rookies
I will try fire strong I want cyborg
how was the folks I party for the four
Titans you had a cannon army do that
never thought I'd be a prison guard QB
that was a long time ago and I'm not you
know what I actually don't mind cyborgs
outfit no no this embed like cyborg and
even even firestorm who's you know kind
of a weird character as is but these
outfits aren't bad I guess it flashes up
it wasn't that bad either
oh yeah oh he had like shoulder pads
reverse-flash did I don't think regular
flash do down three says subjective
flash yeah I find he is one of my
favorite wish fulfillment heroes because
his powers are the best
but if villains and stories are lame so
end up not reading his stories also Jack
do you remember you can punch people
through the side of the maps oh I didn't
remember that thank you for reminding
come on cyborg soupy soupy
oh you missed you missed dink don't
remember how to punch people through the
side of that
if I have to do one of those punches
I just flat-out don't get this don't get
what
captain president says hey guys hi say
what do Shrek and someone's suffering
from bulimia heaven coming
they both subscribe to the notion better
out than in
nobody's cheering for you now I get him
with the bulimic I don't I don't get it
with Shrek and Shrek and in the Shrek
movie there's a line where he belches
were used heavily and better option okay
okay that's a that's a lame joke there's
a lot of setup to that sorry I don't
remember that Shrek says that about
burps
thank you for trying though hey forever
I guess
please try again frankincense hello rich
and Jack my no oxygen run went
flawlessly MFT I beat the cruiser with
only two lattice crew members Oh black
gum two helper beam ion blaster and pre
igniter for the wimps thank you for
introducing me to FTL welcome very
welcome
yeah it's hard part about wanting at all
lanius crew yeah it's finding all ideas
you don't get that many starter sure
sure and you really don't want to be
taking anybody else if you have Atlantis
if you have a lantus ship yeah
depriving that ship of oxygen frequently
sorry car nope nope nope look at
Supergirl I'd be running scared to write
that David you know people says hey rich
and Jax hi you guys should play
injustice - hey now is the perfect time
because you're already playing it
excellent thanks my dudes and fuck my
pennies hole welcome
now I just broke you up
really that's a great move
he's you're super oh you don't have it :
now use it there would that kill me
maybe then don't use it
guess you belong how does Supergirl know
what a noob is she's been hanging out
she's been hanging out in the desert
with Wonder Woman yes a mine and and the
kid in the robot suit doesn't know what
a newb is that was the joke I guess it's
fine it's fine it's not the first bad
one-liner yeah
you're gonna do this it's the only way
no please Superman go wait
wait you're storing Superman in
Metropolis
to be fair like that's you know that
would be the easiest place to build all
the Superjail and whatnot mm-hmm but of
course shut up
dink you can't beat Brainiac Bruce I
can't
why you making this turn back in this is
your situation is so desperate yeah yeah
okay so I was correct you're ready to
stop Brainiac by any means necessary
by the memes at hand what's your game
you're always three moves ahead saving
the world is enough for now I'm never
going back in that cell I think you can
like did I don't know if you're paying
attention earlier but firestorm
apparently has the power to create
kryptonite with his bare hands so I'm
gonna say it's gonna be really easy to
get Superman back in his cell as long as
you can get firestorm anywhere near him
right I suppose yes why was this ever a
problem if you have firestorm around to
make firestorm on your team at all times
just like so what is what does that mean
you need to explain Grodd pretty damn
smart I suppose I just don't he's
psychic I don't know how smart he is
thanks to flashes recon we have
locations for every ship in brainiacs
fleet
they're targeting major cities on every
continent give us some privacy
listen that man about the prison
we was reckless don't pull a stunt like
that again
make up for it by finishing another
mission discreetly we have to evacuate
these cities before attacking the fleet
but we need communications restored
first so before we get started
cyborgs going to fix brother I I am not
that tech support that's not the issue
Victor oh my god he has a little helmet
thing look at this helmet thing
destroyed Krypton she says we have less
than 48 hours before he does the same to
work without tight coordination why
would anyone think that looks good to be
fair I like super girls outfit it's not
the worst but look at his he has like a
it looks like he's wearing a knight year
like war that you wear for it when you
have your dentist like a retainer it
looks like he's wearing the bottom half
of a helmet that is only there to hold
the top half on that was all Fortress of
Solitude it's like it's like metal
codpiece and his armor look and the ones
that go I like out like this to make him
look chubby
let's go
with me yeah like Cara's isn't the worst
she has that weird the the golden belts
thing that actually goes under her butt
which I don't know if I understand but
why'd you keep it keep what
whoa
I know the Pope Tom
hmm forgot that was there you know I've
gotten so used to all the dumb Batman
armor I'm gonna be fine with it
yeah but Superman what why does he need
armor he's Superman
no look I know I know
it's like it's like he broke his jaw and
he has to hold it in place I'm ready to
flood crime I also need to drink meat
through a smoothie I you know we've
gotten used to a lot of ugly outfits
during this live stream that that one
took the old cake er right there
some people like they just think
anything but spandex they can't stand it
so much no no okay with different looks
it's it's the same irrational hatred for
like the red trunks servos sure like
like Batman without the black trunks
looks so weird he's all gray
this time you'll be a good girl for Mama
don't underestimate her
good he's a robot well princess like
your bats gonna hurt him I know I know
we've we hurt too much on the
implausibility but you know what I don't
care yeah
well though they all have super pills in
this universe oh maybe that's the thing
they take Superman pills and it's fine
right
Wow throw that I want to throw that
thing at her oh shit
slamming and baman says slamming of
ammon you guys haven't played it I
highly recommend sleeping dogs GTA clone
or you play an undercover cop in China
and use martial arts and Arkham style
combat that's why I'm pretty sure I own
just like a lot of games haven't gotten
around to it
but thank you they don't have super
pills anymore it just doesn't make sense
yeah that's fine why wouldn't they have
the super pills anymore I think those
would be pretty popular can't they make
more things ran out no I like that they
ran out what the fuck are super pills oh
the reason that Batman can beat up
Superman in the last game as Batman was
taking super pills to make him strong
like Superman everyone who wasn't super
was taking super pac's
yes
confused by the story and they got a
team up to stop the Brainiac last time
they had to team up to stop bad Superman
now they got team up to stop Brainiac
and it's bad Superman is not good
Superman because Brainiac is here I
haven't been I've been I've been paying
zero attention to the details yeah you
don't need him are they better be
breathing bewitching guards late-night

I can't you sat on her head it hurt her
didn't it
you got a defibrillator in there yeah

all right this is really nitpicky but
you know why they rub defibrillators
together because they put the goo on he
doesn't know he just see he's just seen
doctor shows yeah and he doesn't know
why she thinks you're supposed to do
that unless he also had like goo
dispensers in there Braniac collects the
best and discards the rest black canary
and arrow definitely not the best yeah
he's got goo dispensers I take them over
you
I did who did
you can explain to us now how you so
easily get out of Arkham Asylum all the
time is there there's like a hidden wall
and they're like oh yeah no one ever
figured out there's just this one wall
this is the door here yeah how do you
think we get in and out so easy wait
here make sure no one follows us i'm
seeing that jennifer Tilly more money
yeah yeah yeah
those facial animations are kind of
uncanny you know they're this quiet
yeah how about that
Bogey's and they're not bad
the increase in realism of games has
only gotten us to this place for people
bitch girl shit like that
yeah you know it's weird it's weird when
it looks weird grand theft auto vice
city you don't even have fucking moving
mouse on the box
uh-huh no well yes we've cut we've we
have higher standards now rich that's
how it works
sir kickin ass the chats talking about
how much of the Java Venus in this game
a jobber someone who loses to make
someone else look better oh oh yeah no
I'm I'm super sucking look I I think
I've hit Ben once
jobber is that a West Wing term yeah
yeah it's a fine term I've never heard
it jabber before III don't dislike it
they're superstars need to beat somebody
up right and so it's Ho Cogan versus
Jerry Jones who's gonna win right Jerry
Jones probably isn't gonna have a very
good showing against hold hold up right
but Hogan needs to fight the Undertaker
versus Bob Anthony and that would be a
job right
oh no I'm gonna miss oh I might have
cheese my way to a victory here why does
pain look like an Android because he's
wearing a shirt with armor ready to meet
brother I about damn time system still
running brother I needs a clean power
source something Brainiac can't touch
but Gabe's got backup generators that
should do it
someone has a secret admirer but you
guys consider this game to be good
introduction to hit fighting game genre
foreplay before I mean it's a fighting
game with lots of combos if you're a fan
of the DC Universe this could be the
game that makes you want to play you're
saying is you're not familiar enough
fighting games to be able to really rank
this in terms of other fighting games
right that is what I'm saying but I'm
also saying that wait
what liberated from my good looks and
charm - yeah one cyborg Catwoman can see
him
we need that back I thought it was like
a an energy thing in his head but I
guess what I'm saying is if you know
like if you're a fan of Nintendo
characters you're gonna want to play
Super Smash Brothers right because
that's the thing that's gonna get you
into fighting games I guess nobody who
knew the fuck any of the Mortal Kombat
characters world before Mortal Kombat
sure you know look at what's what's
being played competitively I guess no
you know there's a big street fighter
seen a pink
whoa whoa what I can grab a hook so
obviously the winner is going to be the
cyborg that doesn't care if you hit him
in the face uh-huh
who is graded did just the computer
parts of cyborgs apparently which is a
thing now I don't know if that is a
thing in the comics but here we are here
we are
you did it jack
that was an easy one that was not so
perfect smash is a very different kind
of fighting game that is true smashes
the is the sumo bass fighting game where
you want to knock your opponent out of
the ring
these are combo based fighting games
very different this and Street Fighter
and another fighting game that's all I
know
but this is cute if you're into comics
if you're into the DC Universe is cute
you know Marvel vs. Capcom those are fun
games I wasn't Catwoman helping him cuz
it was just something he had to do
because they don't have multiplayer
mechanic it's something I have to do oh
yes some data or warp the whole point of
the show is you work together as a crew
as a team or or is the captain you send
the person most qualified to get the job
done oh no I am definitely the most
qualified personally that means I'm
shepardize the entire Federation I mean
really the entire person universe Bruce
the comms are yours
brother I broadcast on the old justice
Brother eyes a horrible mane yes yes it
is that sounds like a blaxploitation
that's even lamer like Batman I guess he
was oblivious to that when he named the
fucking thing hey man that's a little
tone-deaf don't you think I mean people
really don't like Big Brother spying on
them what are you talking about I named
it after my favorite 70s detective films
brother I on Star Trek why does the
captain ever leave the ship to go on
missions just send underlings to do the
job watch Star Trek The Next Generation
he often does then or almost always
unless it was something like diplomatic
and he specifically needed to be there
right Kirk was a very different kind of
cab yeah and of course the show wasn't
fully fleshed out the Federation so Kirk
would often go Kirk's a little bit more
of a cowboy yeah these little more
hands-on but I suppose you could also
say the Federation it was a little more
cowboy ish back then as well because you
know they were just discovering planets
for the earth the original series
definitely a bit more space frontier
yeah
you know this is something I've talked
about this before in one of my favorite
Super Smash Brothers games where they
have long segments of its just being
kind of a brawler
I would love a section like this in here
to where it's like give me a little
side-scrolling brawler where I get to
practice some of my moves on some weaker
enemies and just go through a level and
and just be a beat'em up you know using
my super moves that would be awesome let
me use some of my super moves on really
weak enemies just to practice my moves
and feel like a badass for a little bit
I would like that
yes Wonder Woman can fly she's been able
to fly for a while Popeye what are you
doing Popeye
captain cold the reverse
your hearts so cold one let's put you on
ice wouldn't that be redundant if ur
heart so cold obviously that's just a
bad singer
you're so hot I better put you on ice
that aunt that just makes sense
dang Wonder Woman you're looking hot
I better put you on ice not snark fail
that's a snart fail because his name is
snart his name snart - snart
are you kidding no what's his a Viet
Leopold snart right someone someone give
me a give me a ruling on this NART press
r1 near the bar patron okay throw a
patron Adam oh I can't I can only throw
the one
thank you for whoever said that great
idea dude
Leonard snart that's his name that's
Captain colds name is Leonard snart oh
oh wait he's dead now
yeah cuz he's just a man Captain Cold is
oh I've seen Captain Cold is just a man
with a gun that's it okay
he's like mr. freeze without being cool
pretty much yeah
without the suit without the the cold
thing he just he just has a gun that
makes it really cold that's it
that's his only thing yeah barks all
yeah some anagram for something here
immortal but in my time Diana
oh the bar patron is back guess what
guess who's getting thrown oh but you
killed that bar patron yep twice now
thank
that mr. Freeze's only thing to it miss
freezed somehow manages to be cool he's
got the big suit
he's got the emotionally cold gimmick
going on
yeah the suits cool and the suit gives
them like super strength and stuff does
that captain cold is like mr. freeze but
not cool right that's a really correct
statement how do you think and yes that
does look like Marty McFly just hanging
out in the background the other bar
patron was totally Marty McFly check out
this bar patron
he just wanted a tab you gotta order
something to have its tab does Jack want
any clashes
I don't think Jack wants to I don't I
still don't necessarily understand the
clash system I don't need to give up
your super to do and whoever wagers more
of their supa dee doop gets like a
little help like you'd rather just use
the super-dee-duper you soon yes we will
Clark we don't have time for please miss
you that's not Clark
eat them cow Brainiac Batman they both
go down today and will rule side-by-side
as equals but not not in that helmet
okay clear
I turn to you when Lois died you took
advantage
what crazy that's not true my love made
you stronger
what you tell yourself
that's what Superman told me scarecrow
okay ask rescue Superman kind of
thoughts oh yeah I think there's a
little green mist before he showed uh-oh
your worst fear is becoming the villain
of this story
suck my chinstrap just awful anger
displacement
I like his I like his non monstrous
costume - I'm gonna be completely honest
with you I I bet that is a that's a
thing that you can choose with him write
his just regular doctor costume visually
this might be one of my favorite
scarecrows throwing that guy at your
enemies will never not be funny
have you seen the Scarecrow's super I
don't think so are you super super
do your super just keep lazily getting
them he's not gonna use it now he's
gonna waste the super Adria's oh he
wasted it all fuck that I think you just
don't know what he used
oh he didn't use anything all right
who's it
I think they liked I think they liked to
wait until you were in the red before
they use their super
oh wow that was neaten laughs he's like
it was like him and the doctor version
of him like ripped me in half that was
super cool but like it interrupted my
super-dee-duper unfortunately but that
was super neat over stop hitting him I
was just poking him a little bit
what every one of Steel URL
no wonder Brainiac what happened dad I
don't have moved over here for somewhere
else now she loved she lost to cheetah
is cheetah magic I don't know anything
about cheap I think she does magic
that's why she can hurt Supergirl since
that's that's a what though the only
weakness Kryptonians have is to magic
okay I know that that is the thing I
know hang in there
the gods will protect us no no magic in
nervous oh this is gonna be this is
gonna be Kristen Wiig she's playing a
Minerva so she must have to cheat on
faster which is taking place in the 80s
did you know that about the new Wonder
wrong it's like in the mid 80s
I'm fine with that
you know why doesn't the retcon the
whole DC Universe they would still keep
that he doesn't takes place before me
I'm steel nope that any original Wonder
Woman
yeah I don't know that's fine that's
still still fine time-traveling did Matt
a steal these - Wonder Woman movies they
definitely happen flashed at a
time-travel thing at a raced history
well he didn't go earlier than the
mid-80s so let's do Wonder Woman movies
definitely happened your coin says
weren't making game suggestions and I'd
recommend atom Zombie Smasher it's kind
of a modified tower defense game and he
can work together an increased
friendship friendship all right noted
I'm kept really tired these people she's
clearly stabbing to death not dying you
know it's it's one thing when they just
punching each other and throwing him
around but yeah she's like her sword is
going through their chest okay so I mean
I agree with you is what I'm saying mr.
Joshua TXS rich as a Cowboys fan I would
love to see Jerry Jones fight the fight
Hulk Hogan did I accidentally name a
real person when you said when I said
Jerry Jones I have no idea who the fuck
that is I have no idea who the fuck that
is unless they're just saying your
fictional generic wrestler Jerry Jones
fighting hos satisfies them as a cowboy
fan Oh is Jerry Jones of football I can
only assume they're a football player oh
he's a footballer cowboys owner okay
oh jesus oh Jesus Wonder Woman you're
losing too much blood
what do you think you're doing car
stopping you before you make a mistake
that lunatic deserves to die maybe but
she's defenseless she's had no trial
yeah I see like I don't mind her outfit
except for those golden things on her
thighs those are weird right some flare
it's weird yeah it's not as distracting
as a lot of the really ugly and giant
shoulder tabs okay yeah I'm with you
just gonna keep throwing up into the air
cheesed it so now we get to see her soup
dedupe right they're super fast and
strong and Gouda you would assume they'd
got into space at least at least a
couple times a day is this like the
nearer universe with people are evil
just because it's not really just
because I mean there's a whole thing you
have to see the first game yeah this
isn't just like it's the dark universe
so everyone who is good as evil the
Joker did something to cause Superman to
accidentally kill Lois Lane while also
detonating a nuclear bomb in Metropolis
yes and this caused Superman to go a
little bit nuts and Superman isn't
taking any shit and he just started
killing criminals and trying to take
over and government and according to
Bruce won't Wayne once you kill one bad
guy well I guess we'll kill him oh yeah
because you know what that's how that
works and some of the heroes wire to
join with Superman and they're either
you go right but this is all taking
place this is the important part in a
different dimension than our so in the
first game the heroes from our dimension
went over to this dimension to fight the
heroes from this dimension that went bad
which meant that they also teamed up
with villains from our dimension who our
heroes and that dimension like Harley
Quinn make sure that the defenses are
prepared
turned his magic Heights conduct from
prying eyes even brainiacs but I don't
expect them to be fooled forever
ha We Need to Talk give me a minute
both of you Damien told me what happened
is Diana all right she's fine but she
was gonna kill Harley I've never seen
her so cold-blooded
yes it's unfortunate I know how is she
thinking
it's unfortunate Diana chose now to deal
with Harley Morenstein
fucking dumbass we got to play the long
con here Clark like oh yeah that was bad
at Diana I'll talk to her later showing
your hand right away to someone who is
equal to your strength and power tell me
does the death penalty exists in comic
books they would make an exception for
the Joker even if it didn't right right
like legs seriously The Joker makes
absolutely no sense yeah like like you
know you know what wouldn't work for the
Joker the insanity it wouldn't work
right Jeffrey Dahmer fucking eight
people and he didn't get off on insanity
they put him in a regular prison right
right and he ate people though wasn't
there some wasn't there some shady
dealings where they wanted to put him in
a regular prison because they knew what
would happen to him in a regular prison
the Joker would be in the same boat that
Jeffrey Dahmer was in yes yeah
you know what I'm gonna get if Dahmer
got killed in the joint by inmates yeah
as would probably happen to the choker
well no cuz he's a manipulator or
whatever but what I'm what I'm saying is
there was at very least no prisoner
would be like hey you killed my cousin
with gas
Gotha oh yeah and then he would shank
the Joker and he could tons of cred for
shanking the Joker
yes absolutely
like the infamous serial killers
typically don't get off on insanity
right
and like obviously rich and I understand
just the straight-up logistics of all
this which is the Joker's a popular
character shouldn't ever ever get rid of
him
you don't think he'd have friends in the
joint okay the other thing that doesn't
make any sense about the Joker yeah is
that he would have henchmen who would
willingly follow him now now 1950s crime
Joker you would have henchmen but
modern-day I'm a psychopath who kills
people and I'm trying to prove that the
world is just crazy as I am
nobody's gonna follow him because
there's no cash in it right henchmen is
going to follow that Joker right right
all he wants to do is murder people yes
yes including his henchmen yes he would
not have entrant in the real world so no
there would be nobody in the joint on
his side right everything you told me
you see the world as a child does well
people joined Isis the Joker is not a
religion
unless that's the shtick well that's not
actually that's actually not a bad
ticker Ajoke or religion like I could
see I could see that as a what henchmen
don't follow cash they follow hopes of
cash what's what's the hope of cash of
in kidnapping Barbara Gordon to make
James Gordon go insane where's the cash
in that scheme where's the cash and
ruining Batman and Catwoman 'he's
wedding where's the cash in that
the Joker would have a very very hard
time fighting yes but I do I do like the
idea of him like recruiting like a cult
or religion would yeah that could work
but that kind of kind of what they did
in the the dark nights his followers
were a little little bit mental
maybe I guess I I didn't think about it
that much how am i doing that
I find power and restraints Cara please
listen to me
with our I'm Clark that suit I can't I
can't take anything you say seriously
it's just ridiculous just look too
ridiculous I know you've been in prison
for a long time but have you seen
yourself in a mirror
what I do over here
then you get a statue made of him and
Kara that I've seen that's Wonder Woman
blonde hair looks too short maybe that
was won over a couple years of this you
grow it out in a corner those are his
parents
okay that makes it that makes actually a
lot more sense
Oh whoopsie missed
I still say a well-written Superman
realizes the error of his ways and puts
himself in jail oh yeah yeah absolutely
he doesn't get to this point classic
Superman
once he's gotten over the grave he says
oh god what have I done
yep all right he does say oh god what
have I done because Superman kind of has
to be able you as a writer you need to
humble you need to find ways to make
Superman humble as a Kansas boy
yeah well make sense as a Kansas boy
yeah and I don't know I just want to
avoid be God comparisons with Superman
I'd be looking for ways to make him
humble
I was very close yeah I could I could I
mean you know
I know I know that Superman has godlike
powers I just I think it's important
that the character doesn't see himself
that way yeah where else it turns into
his AK sniper movie and then the trick
yes exactly we know how that works
spoiler alert very badly
I could see Mon Potkin raising him as a
good Christian kid
oh come on
why would Superman believe in a God from
Earth cuz he was raised in Kansas from
the time he was at infant he's a farm
boy
yeah
get him this time
fucking Cara get your shit together yeah
gonna cheesin yeah what if you could
have saved Krypton I think about it
every day
that's Stanley it's Brainiac
he's extracting the city's early then we
fight back
I must go to protect car doc go we're
heading to Metropolis what about her all
that matters now is stopping Brainiac
when this is over you need to choose
you're either with me or against Clark I
just kicked your ass
she was saying kal-el I suppose she
calls me cattleman
on this universe Superman grew up best
friends with Lex Luthor but Lex was good
right like just good I think no matter I
mean if it's the Superman we know I
think riches whoa this is the story ends
a lot like what was the arc where where
Batman killed Joker so Superman wouldn't
have to comment the time Batman killed
the Joker so Superman wouldn't had to
and then Batman turned himself in to
prison for murder I'm not sure that was
a comic book heck it might even have
been an injustice comic book for all I
know but that's 900 before I think it
was some kind of weird injustice that's
what's been off the good guy does that
that's what the good guy does what why
can't I stop this why won't you let me
fight back how could there be order of
Freddie AK wins
it's probably a big deal if you know you
got your faces
the others are tackling the fleet
shouldn't we be in Gotham Brainiac
controls the entire fleet from that
skull ship take him down take them all
down contacts dead ahead
eventually Batman gets out of prison and
attends Superman's daughter's graduation
or something yeah I'm sure
they gave us an opening
I just think that's a neat idea I always
like that the end of that comic is
really is really nice too because you
know Superman appreciates the gesture
that Batman made and like just casually
walks through the prison walls to give
Bruce a heart shattering everything to
give Bruce oh yeah and then yeah just
parks out like sorry
anybody know every stays in prison
before that's great you're welcome
fuck off what just tie the way that
makes her a face shield is creating a
concussive feedback loop so the harder
we hit it the harder it hits whoop
probably shouldn't listen to what you
guys are saying huh
gently use your heat vision that's not
concussive force complete the extraction
this is the helmet Bible man hath lets
you to fight back he doesn't
Kansas
did they get knocked all the way to
Kansas and as super as Superman gonna
see the farmhouse that he grew up on and
realized the error of his ways hell of a
coincidence
it's that ugly face
Superman the force shield concentrates
its energy at your point of attack move
faster than it can and you might break
through gun
honey
yeah moving faster than the feedback
that's clever decrease yield refresh
interval to 10 picoseconds
it's clever quietly I mean you know if
part of the whole Superman can do
whatever he wants anything he's he's the
strongest fast as fast as fast and super
fast faster than the flash but that's
cute it's it's it's a clever at least
face me Brainiac only a true person who
conquests us would fight me with his
fists and that's what the game ends you
can't have it unless you beat me with
your own bare hands bricks okay even
really think that's what's going to
happen yes yes I do
he taunts Brainiac and Brainiac wants to
punch him to death that's my that's my
official my official guess because it
has to end with you fighting Brainiac
right somehow
Batman why don't you just hacked the
ship
someone's gonna hack where's cyborg
cyborg was already able to defeat
Brainiac other how it happened with that
right and he defeated the hack and they
got their computer back he hacked the
the Brainiac what's he doing now that's
a great question he could really help
out here during the big battle I've seen
the ending of this game on the youtubes
so a long time ago now so I kind of know
what happens I'm not gonna spoil ship
for Jack now let me be snarky just in
case I'm right hope the flash showed up
wasn't years ago escaped injustice to
shortly ever it came out I ended up
watching some of the movies from it from
you
on YouTube sure I'll miss him too you
mean that he was a good friend once I
trusted him with my life
but the Joker got to him and I wasn't
there to stop it I lost my friend Clark
oh I've missed him ever since
meatball partay I didn't listen now we
all die together
no one's giving up yet anyone here from
beetle or firestorm this is your fault
Bruce Cal and I would have been at work
you should have followed our lead stop
it Diana
millions of people are trapped on that
ship we have to save them did you call
him just to gloat alright dude do you
know is that are the DLC fighters
incorporated to the story and so the
story at all I don't think so Oh cuz
that would be great
TMNT show up it's just like we need more
help just portals show up how boy TMNT
right like that's how we defeat Brainiac
we need some extra muscles pizza party
Cal Brandon brain echoes does not
compute oh I'm cut in half because I
don't have superpowers
oh Jesus Christ why is that guy moving
so fast you can do that I'm gonna
skateboard out of here
cowabunga try shorting them out but we
need to generate an insane amount of
power would have science is not the
answer
so he might be vulnerable to a magic
based attack I can drive the immense
magical power from the rock of eternity
through the gateway in conduct but I
need an artifact a medium to channel it
something that can withstand the power
how about the Trident of Atlantis yes
the dwarf we get the shields down Ben
what cyborg said Brainiac controls the
ship with his thoughts but I did cut him
off and brother I its power okay I'll
make a signal disrupted they blow the
alchemy okay I'm gonna do all the things
we asked where they weren't doing all
right
this all makes logical sense
get to your magic land to do your magic
hooptie goop will stay here and punch
him design seems quite a bit cooler than
what they went with for the movies yes
yes though to be fair cyborg is
something that's incredibly difficult to
do live-action I mean that's that's that
realm of weirdness where once see it
once you hit live-action then you get
Bible moans goofy yeah anytime you do
any sort of prosthetic so how do you
still have science in a world where
everyone knows about magic look before
before it was studied and understood
I'm sure electricity was seen as being
magic the thing is if magic exists it's
it's a part of the natural world science
just doesn't understand it yet it has
rules and laws we don't yet know what's
the earth there's the same saying about
yeah significantly advanced looks like
magic
I will give you know soldiers bring me
that sample before the earth is
destroyed and your loyalty will be
rewarded
any significantly advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic time arthur
c clarke
mm-hmm it was one of the big sci-fi guys
yeah Arthur's Seat cleric or Asimov or
Bradbury one of them what it what
they've been reprogrammed
she looks significantly dirtier now as
neat
now that's the materialist view of
science though magic can change every
equation known to science and the
fundamentals don't work anymore
science science has the ability to grow
and change based on new knowledge
yes just because it messes with the
rules as we understand them now doesn't
mean that the rules can change once we
understand them differently by the way
you want to see something funny so in in
this game everyone has a be move which
you know like gives them special powers
like canary can do her scream mhm yeah
Green Lanterns he gets the green glow
which makes it more powerful you know
what Aquaman can do yeah
get wet that's it
raw shark enter throw a shark at her
yeah
so science should necessarily
incorporate magic doom was right science
is the search for truth not let the
assert a ssin that this or that is true
like gravity is works like this science
is just how you figure that out it's a
method it's um right well what happens
if we experiment I think this works that
way let's experiment right in fact
gravity is a great example of that
because our basic understanding of
gravity has changed over the course of
the last hundred years what once you
know that magic exists and it can
rewrite some of the rules we've already
figured out then you figure out well how
does that work then you figure out the
rules to rewriting the rules right it's
all the same shit yo well how does that
rewrite the rules interesting yeah I
think it works like this let's do an
experiment
science is the pentagram on the floor
necessary we'll only a control group
without the pentagram okay and we need
one pentagram written in virgins blood
of course one with non-virgins blood and
then let's go from you know this one
this pentagram is just made with
ordinary table salt right so let's go
from up here variate virgins blood to a
total Horrors blood just someone who's
fucked a whole lot and let's see if that
changes it at all
it doesn't rewrite the rules it allows
us to understand the rules that are
there already know we're talking about
magic if magic can like rewrite the
rules of the the laws of the universe as
we know them that means there's some
kind of deeper laws going on that magic
that magic operates under mm-hmm and
science would just try to figure that
out
presuming magic was a thing
which I don't
please his magic word Kazan no I don't
know
except swated his Shazam no that's
that's black Adam unless he just fought
Shazam when I wasn't looking
no it's black Adam but it sounded like
he said Kazaam instead of Shazam because
Shazam is Shazam
that's that Shazam's magic right black
Adam would have a different magic sorry
so no I said like so his magic word
would be Kazaam which scarabs hard to
kill Batman told me you guys needed a
hand considering your psychic calm at
all
Billy Batson died in the first injustice
scam possibly
yes sir men grabbed his head me give me
the laser beam directly into his eyes
and fried his brain oh yeah maybe yeah
how does this work exactly
we imbue your Trident with a spark of
the rocks power we might is released it
will seek out your weapon your thoughts
will guide the Wizards power to its
final targets I am ready Tarzan just
spider-man in the jungle actually
spider-man is Tarzan in the city if
we're gonna get technical yeah Tarzan
was around for quite a bit longer how
late are we streaming tonight how close
are we to the end
this is wasted
how do clashes work in this are you just
sampling HP or a free combo or something
you're gambling your super-dee-duper
possible HP your super meter yeah so
your super meter you know when you can
do this super awesome move
whoever Gamble's the most you know
knocks down your enemy and you've gained
HP somebody's saying we're about three
quarters
we might have to finish this another
night
we don't wanna go I know it's it's nine
twenty foot and we started at a little
before six yeah
double wasted it because the dick was
blocking there's no Sookie do feelings
go suck yeah I'll just get wet ready and
get wet get wet
come on Aquaman ready and go I'm wet now
next two stronger anglers coursera says
I know you guys aren't into fanfic but
regarding science vs. magic there's an
awesome Harry Potter fanfic where Harry
was raised by a University's compressor
and is determined to understand how
magic works using the scientific method
see why do you even have to make that
Harry Potter since we ever wrote it was
a fan of Harry Potter yeah I guess you
can invent your own new character and
that can still be an interesting thing
yeah you could you could have Fifty
Shades of Grey and then you can sell it
yeah it's like fifty Shades of Grey
which started out I started its life as
a Twilight fanfic huh and then they
whatever her name is just change some
names and it turned into a best-selling
now she's a millionaire yep
so do the same thing
just change the name right like I'm
gonna fight it's Aquaman I want to send
I want to send Gorilla Grodd beat by the
big fish not awesome cringy is fuck
written by smug assholes for people who
don't know science okay look I haven't
read it
just as a concept somebody using science
to try to understand magic in a world
where magic exists yeah it sounds like a
neat premise me premise
maybe they didn't do it justice you
could I don't know to be famous
you know I'd actually you know we've
been news there's been a lot of bad
outfits
I don't hate Aquaman's outfit in this
I'll be honest with you even has a weird
spiky arm thing I just don't hate it
yeah get eaten Bible you wanted it's all
you wanted feed you to my big fish yeah
suck it Grodd
oh shit Alan's been running away running
away running away
don't really like Aquaman and just like
that shark yep exactly
look at Aquaman he's got away but you
know you can do make a shark eat people
even with tats even with tats although
like I don't hate his outfit here I
guess Aquaman is just ridiculous enough
on a base level that if he has a
ridiculous outfit it doesn't make it
much worse you know oh no we weren't
killing Aquaman
Ironman Fah
dr. Dre strange explain magic as
anything else weird being explained by
science you don't understand they had a
they had a whole deal with that in a
Thor the dark world where Jane Foster
you know went to Asgard yeah and was
just like oh what's this what's this and
you know they they had the whole it's
not magic its science and you don't get
yet you dummy
yeah so yeah I got things and even even
in Doctor Strange have you seen Doctor
Strange it's fine I just wanna I just
want to know you know how much of this I
should include with you in the
conversation but even in Doctor Strange
the ancient one kind of has a little
spiel about our understanding of our
place in the universe and how medicine
has grown with our understanding and you
know what you perceived was magic is
just you know a greater understanding so
yeah even dr. strange has a whole shoot
to do which science yeah yeah yeah shoot
to do that's one of the nice parts about
Doctor Strange is it's really just about
Stephen strange learning
giant blue laser someone give me an
uptown please
what's our uptime like goodness we don't
up where's that signal disrupter y'all
y'all got any up Doug oh you have to do
is hit the trigger but it only jams a
local area you need to get within arm's
reach of Brainiac good that voice actor
has just found a really sweet gig and
like he is every cyborg in every single
iteration by the way I mean every cyborg
ever yes okay that voice actor cyborg
and these he's cyborg in the Teen Titans
go he's cyborg in the Justice League
he's cyborg in the lego movie
no he's in the Justice League
live-action that's him no oh no no in
the Justice League cartoon Oh in the the
Lego DC animated features he's uh oh
yeah that's what I'm saying it's like we
have we have an animated cyborg who were
we go oh yeah we're gonna get that one
guy which is great he does a great job
they did it shields look down Supergirl
on me Viktor help the others fight those
betas
ya know it looked like she had a rock it
under her kid she's moving so fast
that's what it is the rainbow trail
follows oh come on you're you're
fighting highly advanced technology you
think you're fuckin bat-jets could I
even last that long
I'll hit it with my missile I'll hit him
with my bat man feel rich
that's a glorified airplane at least he
didn't throw batarangs at them out the
window
hold on Supergirl
the signal gets stronger this way
millions of them
hey all the worlds I will say this is a
better Justice League movie than the
Justice League movie it is it's can you
argue with that
oh god no yeah no I mean you're you're
absolutely right it's a you know big
sherlocky premise and you get a decent
amount of fanservice
yeah all your heroes get together the
fight they do the super stuff and you
know what if you're gonna have a
psychopathic Superman you just own up to
it and acknowledge that he's a
psychopathic Superman yeah
well that well that was the original
story of the Justice the Justice League
movie was supposed to be a two-parter
sure oh not even just like I mean just
in general like all of those rivers not
just Oh even Man of Steel yeah just
start them up psychopath Superman's a
dick that's what I'm going for
you know what I think everyone would
have liked it a lot better it's like
okay evil Superman
Laura's around until recently I had
thought my collection of Krypton to be
complete you will capture it even slogan
Jeffrey Combs of course you could look
either you have failed in every effort
to oppose me you although I will say
there's enough modulation on this voice
where it doesn't even you like Jeffrey
Combs me difficulties loss today just
another few minutes I do like his little
robot or his little skeleton henchman
they're neat
watts
I could make an entrance where's car
captured somewhere on board you're
looking at the goofy gym just in case we
don't it's the strap that's holding on a
helmet that's not there jack it's it's
it's oh it looks like it's just holding
on his toupee oh you know when you're
Superman
you really needed to pay to be on good
that's why he turned evil in this
universe is he went prematurely bald
bring it up this whole bringing out got
Swamp Thing
the firestorm matrix what happens if I
don't choose I've heard enough about
Brainiac in his pleasure
Lachesis Foreman talked a big game back
at my cell let's see how you stack up
I think this world we're gonna go
alright before if we're about
three-quarters we can uh we're probably
we're probably closer than that by now
well but you know also we should fuck
around with all the other heroes and
your call all the DLC stuff it's your
call
it's been quite a it's been you know
quite a week so let's call it here we'll
save the big finale for for Sunday okay
I'm fine with that now don't they have
the same gym straps and Vanquish yeah
but he also has a full helmet that goes
on over that yeah I mean and and frankly
it does look silly when the rest of the
helmet is off but it serves a purpose
what purpose does that serve for
Superman right just just a headband
you're in a vanquish shoot you want you
want to be fully armored oh yeah yeah
absolutely need to cook - right that's
man having that is just ridiculous I
think I cracked the code it's to hold on
his toupee yeah yeah that's the only
possible explanation
oh okay
oh yeah oh there's a ton of shit oh you
just unlock a lot of crap yeah excuse me
oh Jesus
makes it look like this favorite hero
gambit are you saying Superman is doing
a gambit cosplay yeah you know it's it's
one of those things that might be able
to work in comic books like gambits
thing works it is ridiculous if you'd is
redic but it were in a comic book
it works if you were if you were going
to redesign again but you'd probably get
rid of that and he would just have the
overcoat Oh number you get rid of that
like there wouldn't even need to be a
production meeting yeah oh yeah the
gambit movie that is going that goes
that's not even let's not even joke
about that
there there is a I just saw a cyborg a
tree skin color called booyah it's a
thing Jesus Christ we got a lot of
rewards there
so it has like a customized
you carry the thingy the whole thing in
is gambit has awesome armor underneath
the coat yeah but what function does
this chinstrap serve what is what does
gambits chin thing do okay
gambit gambit sends kinetic energy into
objects right the reason he wears goofy
gloves is so that he can grab stuff with
his glove stuff and send kinetic energy
with his son gloved fingers okay what if
it's like a touching thing where he
doesn't want people to touch him around
his neck case they accidentally blow up
I don't see it I don't see it putting
that out there putting that out there
screw you it looks cool the the Batman
thing again I think the gambit thing
yeah the gay everything looks cool I
guarantee you if they put gambit in a
movie they're getting rid of them the
headgear oh they're getting rid of it if
they put Gavin in a movie absolutely
he's not even gonna have armor
underneath he'll just have the overcoat
yeah that's fine yeah that's an ugly
skin turn him up Brown that was these
skinny unlocks that's the booyah skin
Brown I don't know nothing about no
cyborg I'm just saying it looks ugly
they think yeah they did put gambit in
the film did he have the the face mask
that had his hair exposed and his face
oh that's right he was in Wolverine
origin what was the outfit like he had
the coat yeah oh god I got to remember
Wolverine origin now I don't think he
had the thing okay
I don't believe he had the thing

could tell you the hardest thing I've
ever done is there something is there

waste I mean a fucking waste you you've
brought joy to hundreds of thousands of
millions of people throughout the years

happiness to too many people around the
globe proud why I taught myself to build

dozen times by it helps for proud of
yeah that's right tens tens of people
and you built that awesome plinth ghetto
