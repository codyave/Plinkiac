game plays itself I'm sorry about we
will talk about oh you haven't been
watching making a murderer at all no
that's just so fucked up man it sounds
depressing it's it's way more depressing
than you could ever imagine because it
really happened to someone it's like I
know you don't like depressing stuff
well is there proof or is this all just
speculation though they they do the
filmmakers do a really good job of
clearly showing bias on the part of the
prosecutors and police department so
like his innocence or not is irrelevant
there was bias going into the
investigation filmmakers also have a lot
of power to get the messages through
they want to get through absolutely
absolutely
um from monkey me you guys save my day
every time you stream do you have any
idea when the next space cut blu-rays
will be available I need one you do need
one
we don't unfortunately soon I did calls
are happening emails
cause it's gonna happen soon we a lot
more than we thought there was a very
large demand for the space cop how many
people in the chat have seen it how many
got their copy
yeah oh yeah no and with for making
murder there's no proof of any
wrongdoing but there's there's proof of
bias I think
Hale okay we made it to Round three
we're getting our ass handed to us but
we his Stanworth thing is low yeah I
think yellow stem and I stand immersed
in this damn Mena Oh lose basically no
one we got I don't know what any of
these mean great not bad but you're out
of shape you can trade it by Jim not for
free of course but since you know Mick
I'll give you a discount okay
you have the possibility to sign up for
a league fight Finnegan by yellow sign
okay great
center for League get your butt kicked
right that's what you should do
wait click on the board on the board
wish my name will the digital version
have these special features as well
probably not I can only imagine that the
that's what makes blind buying the
blu-ray a little bit better
I don't know if those will ever be
released digitally ok let's go to the
gym I have 10 bucks see here what do we
want to work on what's your problem what
would you probably the last fight I I
need to I need to get moves moves are
power like I was fine with stamina
I need more move I'm gonna I'm gonna see
what this is I don't know what this is I
have I have not played pocket Morty's
because other than the Rick and Morty
connection I'm not sure I'd like it as
I'm not find a foe c'mon right
oh I need to eat how do I eat I mean I'm
sure there's some inherent humor value
to why there's not gonna be jokes yeah
things that are funny you know I got 17
bucks no but I have to eat go home and
eat go home and eat yeah but then I
gotta pay 10 bucks to get back in the
gym and not the fool who went to the gym
before eating you you know
there we go this is doing this is
building me up here fuck we got to eat
again settle down wait
it's it's good for you I mean I need
these yeah you need that ten down there
yeah okay great and then we'll do this
sure I don't know what any of these do I
don't know what any of these do Ridge
we got gave me a lot of red so this
gives me a lot of red this gives me a
lot of green this gave me all of all of
them well I think red I want I think I
want red wait levels up red I did it yay
it's confirmed that the digital version
will have some stuff says mr. shy smile
great you know what I don't which is I
do strange it's weird that it's weird
that you know mr. shott smile maybe Jay
said something yeah on the tweet stirs
okay great let's get out of here we just
trained our asses off and then let's go
let's go home we can train more and eat
so we can eat in here yeah here we go oh
yeah that steaks got what you need
that steaks there we go now we're good
to go now we can exercise here at home
push-ups the only thing we can do at
home is push-ups that's fine something
you can get more here eventually
sure that's sweet van
look one arm which push-ups you think
they could at least let you do the
fighting yourself rather than have that
be automated you would think I think
that like I said this is available
online
the real V on yes
wants to know what was the demand for
space cap compared to other media you've
released feeding frenzy gorilla
interrupted etc and it's pronounced VA
on V a on the real VA on that's not
right whatever
or is it vay on it would be a - in there
there wouldn't be there wouldn't be a -
I'm trying to like cuz feeding frenzy
that was that was a feeding frenzy was a
unique thing where that came out right
as the planket reviews were getting big
yep feeding frenzy you know the initial
release of that oh you need sleep okay
yeah we can sleep we sleep on a couch
you sleep on it that's you know heart
that's fine you're a bummer you're a bum
but you have a house we have a one leave
a one-room house we've gained a lot
today all right let's
let's go work and then and then we'll
fight yeah
we need money we're running out of money
my foot I used to think them walking to
work would train you but I think just
costing you energy uh yeah tired oh no
oh no no but we got 50 bucks so let's go
to the grocery store it's like to a poo
here I'm saying you should have ate
before work I know
what you need that steak
okay
go home too hungry to work
just go eat this eat the things you know
all the fans
except for your heart but you need yeah
you're fucked your brain you're fucked
you just you just fucked I'm sorry you
fuck did the energy drink energy drink
you at all
that'll be good I don't care our
sleepiness then you need a nap I think
you just need a nap yeah everything man
there's some food
come on
okay yeah
listen this is a real life simulator
we're gonna now eat all the things and
fucking I gotta fuckin forget to just
fucked
pretty much you're just fucked you're
gonna starve to death okay you didn't
Jim well enough cuz I didn't Jim well
enough we're gonna go to the gym and
then we're gonna fight some some people
this is not a good idea
this gave us all of them this is Marv
most bang for the buck here this gives
us some blue anymore green I think you
anymore of everything right now yet two
to one and one right you play it like
shit rock oh oh this just keeps going
what's blue weights totally a red red
the symbol for red is a weight this blue
green is shoe so Green is like speed I'm
not sure what blue is technique just
keep clicking on the fangs what gives us
bullet oh maybe this maybe the speed bag
maybe this feedback
there we go let's go this blue
I know I need to stop because I need
that food to go to work because if I
don't go to work I won't get any food I
won't uh Bluest stamina stamina okay
what kind of symbol is that for stamina
I have no idea come on you can do this
get money before you pass out of hunger
looks like some kind of work it's a
blurp okay okay well we got something we
got some okay grocery store good I got
this friend owns a restaurant who he
think you might have a job for you nice
nice
I am never afraid of work the decks of
the food's work I could do it I can't I
have the pizza right now
we can't have this why can't you have a
stick that recovers a ton of your your
knobby thing there's a fist punch what
does that I don't know okay we're gonna
go home we gotta go home no we can't do
that yet what was that that's the pizza
place where we can work we have to eat
first we have to eat then we have to map
I have a frozen pizza have a soda save
this day because we're gonna nap first
we're gonna nap first rich this is the
plan
sorry for the confusion says the real
van the E in my name is a closed mid
vowel normally represented by the
English grapheme a there is no separate
V think of it as they on okay
the real vein you could have just said
that in the chat you might have but we
weren't paying attention to the chat the
real thing on the real van all right now
we're gonna eat again well be sure to
forget by the next stream we probably
will let's be honest he did steak all
right now let's go fight
you really think you're ready to fight
really you really think that okay let's
go work no I'm not ready to fight yet
I'm definitely not ready to fight yet
but Casey proof of the store told me you
guys I've got the vacancy I'm Casey I
need someone to deliver my pecan you
kissing kissing well I'm Casey we need
someone to deliver a pizza and I think
that one could be here that's okay it's
okay that's better I get it it's not a
great case though so it's good you
deliver pizza every time you can deliver
a pizza you get $30 yeah I'll stop now
it's got special pizza we have so many
orders let's talk later
fuck you too like dad said pizza boy so
think about the 16 dollar version that
puts to your happy face up and your
happy face is lower than me agree like
your hearts full yeah full heart we're
fine with the heart
you're nothing but heart Rocco and
bought huh you're nothing but heart okay
let's let's go home and sleep that's our
plan right now cuz we're really really
fucking tired we're gonna sleep then
we're gonna eat and then we're gonna see
if another fight comes your mood is is
quite low it affects your training
efficiency
well fuck man each big do then fuck you
bro I think we can do this and we can
like play games to improve our mood oh
no oh yeah okay that improves our mood
but eat some food hey I am so happy yep
now it's time to sleep great now we're
happy and we're getting some sleep sleep
off and that makes us happy too great
okay it's like a horrible balancing act
that a no way shape or form involves
actual fighting or fighting skills if
you could at least mash buttons that
would be something that would be
something
okay we got to we got to go sign up when
I when I saw this game with that it's
gonna be a lot of a lot of fairly
tedious character stat building with
with some but massive fight sequences
that don't take much skill because they
didn't focus on that you don't you don't
even button match though you don't even
get that you can't you can't even fight
it's cute I love the I love the
graphical style I like the ideas it
seems it isn't that fun overall I don't
know I haven't really played it myself
it's all been you what do you think it's
it's interesting I could definitely see
this as a mobile game you know you know
just something to tap on yeah on your
phone while you're while you're pooping
the fights aspect huge letdown
I I'm hoping you just you just need the
most basic of fighter just the most
basic of fighter would have been
something I'm hoping that something
happens where we can like choose a
loadout of some kind that makes it more
something left of beefcake says I hear
laundry simulators in the works now work
out see if I can get this red bar up
okay good do I have enough money for one
of you for something in here right now
okay I think I've got another game on it
seems like game game dev sim or
something little something like that
oh yeah I've heard good things about
that okay go home by foot
whoa who did
Lu hey kid I hope you're not trying to
focus on too much all at once it's okay
to have a more fuck what you think I
trust both myself everywhere values you
could try but in between the working
eating sleeping
alright good afraid we need to focus on
a couple of course drinks right you're a
smart kid keep at it
hi Chad not true miss Frank I think he's
the cop that raisin ah you do get to
unlock moves as the game progresses but
you get to actually use them yourself or
is the game just no the game just days
yeah I guess I gotta work
game dev tycoon yeah I've heard never
good things about that all I remember is
they they had a funny thing where they
released a copy to the torrents yeah
and that copy if you torrent it it that
copy was overrun by people pirate in
your game so you could never win mm-hmm
and then the people would complain to
them on their message boards like
pirates like people kept buying our game
and there was nothing we could do to
stop it and they're like ha ha
the irony of people the Pirates going to
the dubs and asking if there was some
kind of like DRM they could develop in
the game okay we are now officially
signed up for a fight let's try to some
more like rocky I can't do
impersonations that's my best money
I can't get there before you fall asleep
nice okay stop
by some pizza special pizza back Bobby
I put special Indian spices in it for my
regular customers
I make pizza with extra spices wanna try
some yeah yeah should be to see here it
is the number one slot by the way I have
a special order which needs to be
delivered all the way in Tacoma when al
with a special agreement Casey do you
just put the pizza down nuts about your
agreement I need money
whoa
we don't have any moves we're stronger
than well you're gonna get your butt
kicks what's gonna happen look at that
look at the stance look at the breakdown
you're fucked
you run away oh I can't run run away
I can't run away you have to run away

happy can we just I mean obviously he's
a ninja crocodile he's a kung-fu

that was weird sleep Oh No okay I think
you're Rocky is a little Yogi Berra

not rocky that's a unique character that
I have just created yeah
now we're gonna go home now we're gonna
get some sleep is there a time limit on
what how to develop your fighter to get
so good by this date for the big
tournament no you just do this forever
with no rush forever

racing or something oh we lost lots of
it we got a fight coming up though

when I learn new things I don't forget
you probably have to win fights that's
probably it here we go
leveling up doing this I don't like the
gym anyway you're getting far less per
push-up yeah I think the gym would be
like a lot more efficient could be like
many multiple times more efficient
comically so wait where's all that pizza

this this is and it is it's on mobile
this is a great mobile game this is
something where you could just kind of
click and play for five minutes a day
playing this way is a little strange but
I could see like just plopping down on
your iPhone for five minutes a day
building up your fighter some something
to play for five minutes and then forget

alright let's go to the store rich rich
you back cedar look we all know this
about bid at this point yeah hey I have
to be me I am what I am
what's the title of this game it's
called punch club punch club it's called
references to things the game the game
oh hey I see you started to fight that's
good
my old fighting guide on the table
didn't maybe it'll help you thinking
that leg straight how old to train
properly don't try to reach a high level
in all three stats choose your way and
try to build your body around one
general ability strength increases the
damage of your hits agility increases
your accuracy and chance to avoid enemy
attacks stamina increases energy
regeneration during the fight also
increases your damage absorption observe
what so we choose this okay
so what do we what do we think we want
to do do we just want to pummel people
do we want to be agile dodge attacks
well you know what you let me read but
it says fragile hold on if you're agile
enough you can perform very difficult
kicks and dodge opponent's hits dodge
enemy attacks try to use counter-attack
skills and high base damage do not focus
on straight dependent moves and damage
absorption and stamina energy is your
power you can afford high energy
consumption moves and the blocking
damage you're not agile so don't try to
dodge attacks I think you know what like
we are we were already putting stuff
into strengths mm-hmm bludgeon people
with just bludgeon people to death would
you get that uppercut yeah and I think
that's a bludgeon move yep I thought I
would assume great
we're gonna we're going to nap Oh nope
we're gonna eat
now we're gonna nap yes chat we have
played Lakeview cabin before me yeah we
played that on the stream they want us
to go for a magic build you're funny
Oh ch at you now have no food you know
that means we got to work that means why
do you have a laptop about me I mean oh
that's a really good oh that was a
charging but it doesn't need to anymore
okay that's a really good question okay
here we go ah the boy does look like the
dumbest thing by the way which boy the
the movie the boy I never what is the
boy if he's not seeing it it's it's a
new horror movie in which a young girl
gets a babysitting job and then they say
you know here are all the rules you must
follow and then they reveal that this is
somewhere a person she's babysitting is
a doll yeah yeah it stars the lady from
The Walking Dead get more money here and
we get money faster here and then we get
pizza too
it looks really dumb though in its
defense because we wanted to pick a
stream we could blather with each other
and we're not really blathering oh I'm
saying the boy yeah in the boys defense
I like that kind of high premise schlock
you know I don't know that the killer's
a doll people saying hi to me in the
channel okay they're gonna kill us a
doll and I and she has to babysit him at
all right good let's go for it
good that's it that's been a thing since
the dummy episode of The Twilight Zone
sure it's a thing it's a thing but what
I'm saying is I I would rather have a
slaw key premise like a murdering doll
other than like it's a ghost and the
ghost kills you you know it's a murderer
and he murders you give me give me some
luck everybody likes luck okay where's
the pizza
my money that I just earned there is
going towards pizza grocery store there
are no bad guys do beat up today they're
giving you advice saying take the bus
when you have money walking takes time
leaving you less time to train and work
oh yeah I was I was thinking walking
would would help train when I first
suggested walking to work doesn't seem
to be the case okay have we seen the
revenant yet some of us have that's
weird that's a weird thing to say two of
us have
thank you guys so much because I just
bought this on Steam I got suckered into
a 67 percent off ducktales - thanks doc
tells us great the show and the game
mm-hmm I've said it often scrooge mcduck
is the best Disney character though
though I guess technically isn't like
spider-man a Disney character now that's
true
well but it's still technically a Marvel
so yes but Marvel was technically Disney
technically it doesn t care hey
spider-man you'd have a crossover with a
Little Mermaid and it would be nothing
yeah go ahead do it
come on red bar get up there
what's what's going on in the world
today jack you know there's a lot
happening in the life of it okay you
know what you don't want to do what turn
69 you don't want to be 69 years old
anymore ever
that is true busting make make I'm
hungry give me food thank you I fight a
motherfucker move we lost Bowie
we lost alan rickman Dan Haggerty yep
Grizzly Adam Grizzly Adams yeah oh wait
locked
oh oh well get rid of a kick
what are the stats x go up we'll see I
wanted to say 484 457 four so this this
is more accurate so we definitely want
the punch simple an energy efficient yep
this doesn't do any more division it's a
less Act agility get rid of the kick and
replace it with the epic on it yeah and
then the uppercut is about as accurate
as a kick but more powerful okay great
ready begin
I was thinking about Robin Hood Prince
of Thieves when when I'll be Alan
Rickman's stuff yeah I was kind of like
oh man that movie so bad but so good bad
this is a strange thing to me is like
the first thing anybody is saying about
him to passings star of Harry Potter
films that's well that's that's how the
majority of people know I get it
he was the huge star of all the Harry
Potter 50
he's his hands a grouper his mother
fucking Hans Gruber he's he is he is the
man that invented the Eastern European
villainy he said he's guy from Galaxy
Quest Wow he's ons Gruber what else is
in a Robin Hood Prince of Thieves of
course yeah he plays a wonderful role in
dogma the Kevin Smith movie as the as
the the voice of God as he should be
Alan Rickman should be the voice of God
what do you love him and dog well he's
just he's just everything good and
everything
you're one in the fight weight in the
fight feeling good when in the fight and
feeling good ran out of stamina though
slighest 69 is I guess he would be 69
yeah it's not young man
Sylvester yeah yeah you know what watch
for the sudden cancer death of Sylvester
Stallone in a few weeks right a week
maybe tomorrow anything's possible
we went
I mean Hans Gruber is probably the most
interesting character in diehard
more so than John McClane sure oh here
we go
this gives us an additional ability slot
that's important to me he's Hans Gruber
forget Galaxy Quest it's garbage yes I'm
just saying I put I put he's more
notable for Galaxy Quest then for Harry
Potter to me but yeah definitely
I heard overall
whose strength all for never been a
Doctor Who fan would alan rickman have
been a good doctor
he know what he would have been he would
have been a great like weird alien in
one episode to interact with the doctor
what's what's the doctor's arch-nemesis
the evil doctor the evil Time Lord evil
Time Lord even would have been good for
that no because like the evil Time Lord
had this wonderful insanity about him
Alan Rickman Alan Rickman needed to be
just like that in several Doctor Who
episodes there are these like you know
corporate businessmen of the future of a
distant alien planet that just want to
wipe out everything you know for a
corporation that's Alan Rickman
okay Alan Rickman is too cool
yes Tim Curry has one he has one foot
out the door
huh arguably he's already passed away
look he had a massive stroke right did
he yeah I think he had a stroke how much
of your brain has to die before you're
already effectively dead what percent of
you what percentage of you has to be
gone before you're not really you
anymore shit happens but it happens all
of these things are true
shit happens but it happens
I give you money thank you ooh now we
got money hey stop
okay now we got some money what do we
need we need groceries
we need gym we need more money some
groceries for home hey Pooh great
right
today's all bun today's all about money
today's a money day
and when Rickman will always be Marvin

anonymous says thanks for entertaining
me in the midst of a marathon after
effects session you hacks there you go
it's always nice to have something on
you no after-effects wait you know like
when you're editing video there's a lot
of sound involved but when you're doing
After Effects works there you need to
fill that void with something and yeah
like this stuff like this podcasts are
really great for that
training hard today training hard today
okay so by the way the longer you do a
workout the less effective it becomes
over time so you guys vary up your
workout okay so like we get full bubbles
but if I keep running eventually I'll
get not full bubbles yet to feel babbles
I'm good with the green here doing go at
the green and switch it up
I can green out perfect play darkest
dungeon instead darkest dungeon didn't
we play that once yeah you didn't like
that yes hungry and protein boom
protein bar
super games today super games and we got
a fight coming up doing great feeling
great so we're just gonna see if we can
gain any more and here we'll go eat and
then we'll go fight cherry tonic says my
bf said he would totally buy you guys
copy of EDF 4.1 I'm assuming that's the
Earth Defense Force oh yeah for the ps4

on red and stop trying to balance your
stance all right well yeah no and I I am

five bucks I can take the bus home what
I have a fight today
hey kid have you knitted out have you
kitted out your garage with gym
equipment yet if you can save up enough
cash and buy the gear you won't need to
keep visiting the gym as much I guess
that would save me if everybody's
hanging mini yeah would ya oh but if you
have too much cash on you people will
try to steal it sleep a little bit right
before a fight cuz that's good for right
before a fight we did all we have to do
is make sure that we fight today
good all right and let's go fight her

was called Helldivers are they the same
game here we go
no wait now I have three moves that's
uh-oh this guy's so fucking done rich
were you four in the president's
presidential election and why we don't
like to get the politics too heavily I
will say I am NOT for Trump I think
we've made them mad fuck Trump
we've made that abundantly clear there
are thugs but it's probably best not to
get into politics yeah
you're not here for politics you're here
to get away from all that until I decide
I really want to talk about power
there is no God and your beliefs are
wrong there I said it
I did it we're talking about now we're
talking about how wrong your religion is
yeah whatever it is I by the way my
power am I going with the power strategy
I pummeled that guy
