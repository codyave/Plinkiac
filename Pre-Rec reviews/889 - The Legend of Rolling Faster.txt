Jack: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. This is a classic game, but i think it has three major problems. Namely, one big-ass field and two little legs. Link runs, like, super slow. So most players I know roll as often as possible, whenever possible, because you seem to move a little bit faster while rolling. But do you really? Do you actually move faster while rolling? I've always wanted to know this, and so I set up a little race. Starting at the load break from Kukri Forest, following the visible path, and ending at the threshold of the drawbridge in front of Hyrule Castle. By the way both of these runs were captured from a 3ds XL at 30 frames per second. And, go. And there you have it. Rolling is crazy faster. It's, it's actually about 35% faster, which is huge. Why would a Nintendo even do this? Unless they just didn't know any better. Rolling also has very little disadvantages, besides the, the constant grunts and screeches from Link...and that's not so bad, right? It's not so bad?
