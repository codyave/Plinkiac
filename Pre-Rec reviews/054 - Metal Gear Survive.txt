hey Jack hi rich Jack are you ready to
talk about mgs Metal Gear Solid no Metal
Gear survive mgs Metal Gear survive not
mgs Metal Gear Solid but this takes
place in the Metal Gear Solid universe
but this is Metal Gear survive not Metal
Gear Solid SMG and they're both mg look
it's terribly confusing fortunately
nobody gives you shit about Metal Gear
survive and it's already been forgotten
about
yay well this is this is the this is
this is a big deal this is important
because this is the the first Metal Gear
that happened after the kerfuffle the
Kojima curve the code the Kojima
kerfuffle that's a hard phrase to say
the Konami code Jima kerfuffle the the
KK you know if someone is unaware Hideo
Kojima has been making Metal Gear games
for a long time and has but kind of been
like the Metal Gear games have been his
what he called us his child his baby
yeah this thing he is the UH tour yes to
the Metal Gear series he designs every
aspect from the intensely intricate and
fun gameplay to the batshit crazy story
that makes no sense
the convoluted nonsense yes
in any case a hugely popular series
hugely fucking popular what happened how
did it go Jima get ousted um as I
understand it that's kind of just what
happened what I can only assume happened
is he wanted a bigger budget to make his
games and games already cost so much to
make and weren't necessarily turning the
profit well this this is the this is the
triple a problem right now I looked it
up the the budget and this said nothing
about advertising this just said the
game development budget not the
advertising budget as we all know that's
going to inflate things 80 million
eighty million dollars to produce Metal
Gear Solid 5 yes that's a lot of money
yes and a Konami and I you know what
Jack I don't fucking blame them they're
they're looking at this this eighty
million dollar fucking budget and say
the game bombs they're fucked absolutely
said save the game does well enough to
make a ninety million dollar there fuck
they're fucked as a company I think they
very wisely realized we can just make
pachinko machines
cheaply and make a shitload of money
yeah and this was the right call this is
what's wrong this is what's wrong with
Triple A games they cost a lot to make
and it's a huge risk if you're if you're
investing in the game absolutely and
this is why they play it safe and this
is why everything fun and gaming is
coming out of the indie games this is
why I stopped playing metal gear survive
so I could play into the breach which
has recently come out by the developers
of FTL it's a really fun game and so
they got rid of Kojima and now Kojima is
making his weird art bullshit on his own
Konami they're not idiots they know they
have the rights to this series that is
hugely popular yeah and so the first
thing after they started making pachinko
machines is they made a Metal Gear Solid
pachinko machine
well they rise with is that there's not
that big a crossover between these two
markets this game series that's popular
in the West and this gambling machine
that's popular in Japan there's not a
lot of crossover there so if you want to
if you want to profit off of your hugely
popular series yeah but you want to keep
the budget down you just make a Metal
Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain mod this
is a zombie mod for Metal Gear Solid 5
the phantom pain this is using assets
already created and doing the bare
minimum of game development across the
board yes
it's it's it's a survival game and I
felt like getting into the actual game
Metal Gear Solid is a survival game and
so basically you have to collect
resources to craft stuff in your base so
that you can get stronger so you can go
further out to collect more resources so
you can bring them back to the base so
you can craft more things so you can get
stronger so you can go out even further
to collect more things so you can bring
them back to your base and make your
base and you stronger and when you are
even stronger you can go out even
further and collect more resources so
you can bring them back to your base I
know you hate this concept it's not a
terrible thing the survival game of you
can look at the water games you can look
like a SimCity if you build some some
areas for your cities so they make
generate tax revenue so you can build
new areas to your city and just you just
keep growing that's the game that's III
Sufjan I dislike the stagnation of these
types of games I hate the idea of
hunkering down like unless you're for
like Sim City is really cool like that
that has other aspects that I think
elevated like making an entire city but
here you're putting up fences around
your dust pile
there's some kind of nugget in there
Jack in this tiny nugget there's a tiny
nugget of intrigue for me and it helps
that it's got a very solid foundation
because gameplay-wise just gameplay
Metal Gear Solid 5 very good game
absolutely since it's got a solid
foundation they just built like a shack
on top of the foundation I don't I but
but there's rare there's barely any
metal gear in this survival game it's
not like you're gathering materials to
build awesome robot mechs you just find
one laying around they wanted to profit
off of a hugely popular franchise as
cheaply as they can do it that's the
entire review we're done here
you're incredibly correct when you say
this is a mod this is a fan created my
it's a zombie mod right there's like
there's like you know Grand Theft Auto I
was wondering a Sambi mod yeah like
Metal Gear how about a zombie mod for
Metal Gear all right it's in it you know
what it's a cute little too our
diversion and everyone has a great time
for the free zombie mod why zombies my
zombies meta you know Metal Gear is all
about like military tactics and and big
bombastic over-the-top bad guys right
well not only not only that but like
zombies finally one person who doesn't
say zombies are played out find me one
everyone hate Somme because everyone's
sick of zombies why zombies she bare
minimum effort right so imagine that you
are the the lead designer of this game
right yeah and you say okay well we need
a lot of enemies but we don't want to
spend the time individually programming
them oai is hard to do AI is really hard
to do so my god you're right you make
one zombie copy paste copy paste do you
want to join a level to be more
difficult paste paste paste paste paste
paste paste done it's more something
more something your god I think that's
right I I think it's right to
we walk around stomp around the zombies
it's overall a less compelling
experience than Metal Gear Solid 5 oh my
god
hey understatement statement of the year
and it probably has the worst menus out
of any game I've ever played important
important things important things are
like hidden under three sub menus how do
I equip my weapon I don't fucking know
I I needed to cure a wound I just needed
to cure a wound I was throwing up
constantly I needed my antibiotics yeah
I inventories your stuff is in the
inventory like when you need to eat you
go into your inventory and you can eat
from the inventory so I got a med kit in
my inventory I open the inventory
there's oh there's the med kit I can't
heal from here oh why can't I yield from
the inventory get it from the inventory
why can't you from the fucking inventory
that's ubiquitous user interface you
click on the thing in your inventory
there should be a use button I I was
running low on oxygen because there's
there's dust and you can't breathe in
the dust so you need an oxygen mask
whatever and I I was trying to refill my
oxygen I'm slowly I'm slowly suffocating
I'm going through the menus just where
do I do this where do I get more how do
I add the oxygen I know I can do it the
computer told me I can do it where do I
go everything about this game is an
exercise in inelegance even the way I
describe it is inelegant navigating the
user interface is terrible every
everything about this and you don't
understand what anything does no you
don't understand the building you're
building or why you're building it I
remember I was finally got to that point
where I could make water clean water I
could make my own clean water and I had
all the stuff but it said I needed a
hanging kettle but I had a campfire but
the option to make clean water was there
I could see it but it said I didn't have
the right things but then why could I
see it because I needed to go to I need
to leave that area go to a separate area
build a third area leave the second area
go to the third area and then as it
turns out the third area was also the
first area but also the third area so I
could delete the first area if I wanted
to but I didn't figure that out until 10
hours later I was going to like the
tutorial section of this game and I
found like like missions extra missions
I killed 30 zombies and you get me to
think yeah I like the day
after that I played this game again I
was looking for that menu because I
wanted to try a new mission I couldn't
find that menu I didn't find that menu
until two days later when I stumbled
onto it on accident the goal of any game
I feel is we talked about this in our in
our slaves fire yeah review which is
tough you want to hide the math you want
to hide the Excel spreadsheet into
something very easy to understand you
can have the math you just make it
accessible and easy to understand yeah
I'll take that I'll take that too this
could be designed better
survival games aren't necessarily my
thing but I I think I understand the
idea it's you know slowly growing over
yeah you know and that's the ubiquitous
through a lot of games but it's just
like oh I I can collect a bunch of stuff
and eventually I know how to build
bigger stuff and I can get bigger and
stronger and it's that slow progression
of one of the things that really
bothered me about Metal Gear survive is
some of your survival elements were tied
to story missions yes and so it didn't
matter what you went out to collect how
far you got you can't make clean water
until you finished chapter 7 I I want to
jettison the entirety of the story and
just have an open world survival yeah
just just just do that and you get your
bullshit out of here the the save the
nurse mission and there's there's the
only one way to go about it I went to
the area where the thing crashed I found
the nurse but okay I'm gonna sneak out
the way I can no you can't you can't do
that the story wants you to go through
here to activate the portal and then
fight off the zombies at the portal no I
I got her I got the objective I just
want to sneak out survival game I want
to stay alive no you have to do the
action adventure story mandated section
it doesn't help that I've been playing
dishonored you can do that shit it
doesn't help that way by the way when I
was supposed to be playing Metal Gear
Solid all I'm sorry Metal Gear survived
at many points I just said fuck it and I
put on Dishonored look palette cleanser
no but by the way like it doesn't help
that we've played Metal Gear Solid 5 and
you can do that shit this is in canon
choose how you infiltrate the base shit
that this game has jettison if this is a
step
backwards in its own series yes I was
about a linear survival experience
before it seems like a contradiction
doesn't it yeah a linear survival game
it does seem like a kind it almost seems
like it wouldn't work okay it seems like
it wouldn't work you know if you tied
survival aspects to store you
there was some bits that I enjoyed my
first time in the dust
so in the game there's normal areas and
then there's the dust yeah and in the
you know in every area you need to worry
about hunger and thirst but in the dust
you also need to worry about your
oxygens yes and my First's crawl into
the dust was genuinely exciting like I
said check there's a nugget in here yeah
and I I agree with you and you want to
kill the Wanderers so you can get their
cubot energy so you can refill your
oxygen because somehow that works but
fine but you also want to avoid them
because you don't want to run out of
your food or water and fighting and so
it was a genuinely nice experience I was
having a really good time until like I
had enough clean water and food because
of my upgrades you just walk in and run
around and do whatever you want
you know you know where the game fell
apart for me I talked I talked about
that that nugget in here that nugget is
the survival elements I I like the
survival to staying alive or avoid the
enemies doing what you need to kind of
find the food and and then for I don't
know why for no reason they threw in
like defeat the whore defend the thing
against the horde of enemies I was I was
kind of enjoying myself and then I had
to turn a machine on and swarms of
zombies came out and attacked the
machine like this is what I want to do
well done tower defense is great this is
just defense there are no towers there's
no strategic build the thing that slows
the enemies down here that I build the
thing that shoots at the enemies here
it's just the enemies are swarming
here's your fence and you got a stick
wasn't there anything satisfying by the
way about playing as one of big bosses
scuzzy mercenaries there would be if
your character was anything right your
character never talks yeah everyone
talks to you and about you and through
you but you're nothing you don't
contribute anything to any conversation
what do you mean we can't be the only
ones who've ended up here we can go home
any time now right so why don't we help
the captain save as many people as we
can first look I'm not some kind of
charity worker here I'll help out as
long as there's a common mission but
once that's over me and the captain are
done tell me you understand that I'm
just thinking I'm the scuzzy big boss
mercenary why am I in charge the captain
what about that guy who's a UN soldier
why don't they put him in charge of
something I should be the prisoner and I
get sent out into the wilderness because
I'm expendable bottoms good I'm a part
of the mercenary organization that was
acquiring nuclear weapons you don't put
me in charge of anything but now you
have to tell people which vegetable
garden depend
and really appreciate it if you grew up
it faster you have vegetable gardens and
and water filtration systems and even
little missions that you can send your
dudes out on and say hey if you go here
you can get ten steel but here's another
little piece of the bullshit pie that is
metal gear survive which is you can only
send out one group at a time and if you
want more groups to go out you have to
pay in-game currency and that nice and
that nice and you know and you wonder
why the good games these days are the
indie games triple-a is doomed isn't it
it's doomed the cost cost cost too much
to make and so they have to resort to
this kind of shit this absolute shit
that nobody likes in order to make money
console gaming is fucking do
triple-a console gaming this is it
it's this is it it's it's not doomed
we've seen it before in the movies which
is the giant company buys everything
that makes money and Everett one company
will control all the things that make
money do you think there is hope for a
console gaming market where everything
comes from
EA do you think there's any kind of hope
for this cuz they're the ones who are
gonna come out on top
you know personally I don't think
there's hope for it what what I'm saying
is you're right but it will still be
it'll be doomed in the fact that it's
gonna suck it's still gonna be there but
doesn't matter doesn't matter if you
don't want to play any of the fucking
crap that's coming up because it's all
microtransactions samey bullshit yeah
does it matter if they're still making
them
mm good point fortunately there's into
the breach thumpy games but the triple-a
thing that's flames man flames you know
it's looking that way yeah it's it's
tough man it's tough
into the breach is great the soundtrack
I like it small groups of people who
care making games for love it's a good
thing and that's not to say that there
aren't those triple-a developers still
pulling it putting out gálvez de
Bethesda ESDA Nintendo Nintendo yes
still putting out quality Blizzard I
asked you to so many Blizzard games I
play sure I mean but they're big and
yeah I'm a big overwatch person and so
we're already seeing kind of a
consolidation of power right is the big
guys by the little guys that make the
money so they can make the big guys yeah
but in EA's case they just devour
everyone they bring under come on come
under our house it's a trap
don't go to EA it's a trap yeah is the
is the candy cottage in the forest
eating all those orphans studio and all
the little game studios or skipping
through the woods going oh I wonder if
we could eat some our games are too
expensive to develop Hansel we need help
come into my cottage I have all the game
development tools Hansel
Jack can you can you believe can you
even believe that metal gear survived
has that the gall the absolute fucking
gall to charge money for a second save
file isn't that just the most disgusting
thing that has happened in gaming it is
with without a doubt it is and either
there's gonna be some contrarians out
there who saved you know but you don't
need a second save file do it all the
time
but they're offering it well yeah my
contrast of that is something like
breath of the lines which is fantastic
game but you can only have one save file
at a time because of limitations with
hardware but they only offer you one
save file you know you only have one
safe out there's nothing you can do
about it
here they they put the cupcake out for
you in in Metal Gear survived they put
the cupcake up you want another save
file you could start another character
play the game differently is your
cupcake just a little bit of in-game
currency you can do it
hot mess just a just a gosh-darn hot
mess I think people kind of know where
we're gonna stand on this but would you
recommend Medicare survive you know I'd
say there's a there's a nugget of
something in there but they fucking
charge you money for a savefile they can
go fuck themselves and die in a fire
they can choke on their fucking metal
gear pachinko machine fuck them
