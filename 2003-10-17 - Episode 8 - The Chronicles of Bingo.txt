Bingo: How did I get in this egg? God, the pain is so bad! Barkeep? Barkeep? Barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep, barkeep?
Barkeep: What's up? You want another one?
Bingo: Hit me. Milk. Simon Birch? Mr. Simon Birch, sir? It's a true honor.
Simon: Of course it is, Bingo.
Bingo: You know my name?
Simon: Of course I do, Bingo. I saw you in that Russell Crowe movie. You were great as a cannonball. You were excellent. Just fucking awesome.
Bingo: Thank you, Mr. Birch. You know, I, I didn't think anybody actually saw that.
Simon: So tell me, Bingo. What are you working on now?
Bingo: Well, well you, well you know, I, I've kinda been typecast as a cannonball. You know...
Simon: That's fucking bullshit.
Bingo: What? Why?
Simon: Let me tell you something, Bingo.
Bingo: Okay.
Simon: You think being typecast as a cannonball is tough?
Bingo: Yeah.
Simon: Try being typecast as a little boy with no neck and glasses.
Bingo: Oh.
Simon: Just try getting some work after that.
Bingo: That's terrible, Mr. Birch, sir.
Simon: Fucking right, it's terrible.
Bingo: Okay.
Simon: Hey, Bingo. There's that Jay Bauman guy you did Monkey Make Movie with. Oh, that was a good show. You should fight to get back on that show. It's nothing without you. Let me ask you something, Bingo.
Bingo: Okay.
Simon: You ever heard of that Jonathan Lipnicki asshole? The little fucking douchebag from Jerry Maguire.
Bingo: Oh.
Simon: He was up for the role of Simon Birch. I had to fight. Fight, Bingo, for that role. I kept trying to tell the producer, he's not even a midget, he's just a little kid.
Bingo: Oh.
Simon: I fought, Bingo. I fought for what I believe in. And now I'm billed as Simon Birch. So if you don't wanna be typecast as a cannonball, get out there and fight for what you want.
Bingo: That's the best advice I ever got from a midget with no neck and glasses, Simon Birch. Thank you, Mr. Birch.
Simon: Lipnicki.
Lipnicki: Birch.
Bingo: Hey.
Jay: Hey.
Bingo: How are you?
Jay: I'm good. How, how are you?
Bingo: Oh, you know. I'm okay. so, uh...what's new?
Jay: Nothing. What's new with you?
Bingo: You know, not much.
Jay: Heard you got a part in a movie.
Bingo: Yeah, you know, I played that cannonball in the, the Master and Commander movie.
Jay: Right. Right.
Bingo: Have you lost some weight?
Jay: No.
Bingo: Oh. Have you gained some weight?
Jay: No.
Bingo: Oh. You look good.
Jay: Thanks. You, too.
Bingo: Thanks.
Jay: So, uh...
Bingo: So.
