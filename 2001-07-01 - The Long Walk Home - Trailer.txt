Sometimes, I walk alone at night and I wonder.
I wonder if I've made the wrong choices.
Goddammit.
What do they want from me?
If I did things differently, this would not have happened.
I did not kill her.
I will never know the answer to these questions.
But there is one thing I do know.
I know I can stop it.
I know I've never been a perfect person.
I know I've made mistakes.
But goddammit, they've gone too far.
They killed her!
This time, it's personal.
