wounded officer who had been hit with
gunfire from a heavily armed fugitives
Pratt after being hit in the right leg
returned fire and mortally wounded the
suspect like a good cop never aimed a
wound aim to kill or kill through a
wound which I guess is how every murder
by shotgun works really it's it's a
wound that causes the murder regarding
I'm just rambling now at this point if
y'all find the all-time is kind of like
citations RIS personal injuries having a
small child for burning vehicle whatever
I don't like children they're noisy
insubordination well that's not good on
duty drug consumption confidential in
fishing internal shame Lloyd Pratt might
be doing drugs on the job John Dooley
Dooley Dooley we've got a goofy name I
don't like him because he's got a goofy
name like good good old-fashioned proper
names not silly names de velas names an
end to the Y Dooley was instrumental in
breaking up the largest auto theft ring
in the history of Lytton which means one
car written is a very very small town
I can literally drive to the other end
of town in about two thirty seconds
really thirty seconds is all it takes
but then again I'm a cop and I can drive
as fast as I won Dooley arrested six
suspects because it was a clown car
and the cover to tell vehicles that were
still outstanding
censurable - puts nun laura watts Laura
why does Laura watts let's have some
more variety in our names people come on
experience and usually heavy rain
resulting in mudslides and road closures
while working Traffic Division officer
watts moving into an area while we're
commuter traffic and come to a stop
officer watts professional and
independent action was successful in
diverting traffic to an alternate route
which cleared a potentially explosive
situation because that's what you do
with women cops you have them direct
traffic meanwhile the men will stop the
murderers in the filth and get shot now
you go tell those cars where to go honey
make sure to write plenty of tickets so
we can afford our salaries because
that's the only reason there are tickets
we write tickets to justify the
existence of the police Oh
sensual reports being caught red-handed
making chicken tracks across the top of
Sergeant Dooley's deaths with a rubber
stamp this brought to light the true
identity of the infamous gremlin oh my
god the mystery has been solved the the
leftover mystery from police course it
was it was Laura Watts Laura Watts who
knew put the chicken on the desk she's
supposed to cook the chicken she did a
bad job James busy well I learned at the
office writing reports officer Pearson
encountered a hysterical man who advised
him that his wife was laying in the
backseat of his car giving birth to a
baby as women should do
calming the man down opposite person
successfully proceeded to aid in the
birth of a healthy baby boy
thank God the proud parents honored him
by naming their new addition James
censurable reports while assisting in
giving in in birthing the child
officer James that looked at a vagina
and that is unacceptable behavior of a
police officer that'll make you straight
never look at a vagina
oh wait what that'll make you straight
looking at a vagina it's the it's the
opposite of looking at a fetus wing-wang
a Willie a Jim Jim why am i censoring
him for looking at vaginas then he got
censured for that that doesn't make any
sense
Jaidyn been censored because I don't
like nudity
he got censored for that superior effort
and traffic management at the scene of a
double fatal chain reaction collision on
the Litton freeway
Oh oh my god officer Robertson's action
quickly brought the scene under control
and prevented further tragedy is there a
file on you yeah look at this look at
this magic me while working narcotics
division during 1980s it's funny because
I said it was 1986 earlier I guess it's
a little bit later than I thought it was
obvious and bonds received the key to
the city for his effort the arrest of
drug King Jesse Bates due to this effort
Baines was convicted and sent to prison
for murder drug trafficking illegal
gambling activities and the attempted
murder of a police officer boom since

bronze-medal shootin why is the last one
the most boring one shooting event
bronze-medal that's great Wow Wow we
didn't save anybody or murder anybody
not every cop saves somebody by
murdering somebody else not everyone
could be like a superstar or a big
dickhead who's my last police file would
have been that officer who drove a car
off of a burning ramp to land on a drug
dealer that would have been my final
file and the police report drove his
burning car off of off of a highway ramp
parachuted out of the car while whipping
the middle finger at saddam hussein then
landed on a drug dealer he didn't he
didn't send the national anthem and
killed Muammar Qaddafi while saluting
the President of the United States a
