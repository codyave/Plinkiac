Jay: Yeah. Don't have it? Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Woman #1: [Indistinguishable]
Jay: Can I get you on camera saying that? Oh, I was gonna ask you to ask the person on the other end of the phone, too. Is there any way you can call really quick and ask if they've heard of Mindscape Pictures?
Woman #2: No...
Woman #1: Well, I guess I could call a bunch of people, but I don't think they've heard of it.
Woman #2: Mindscape--
Jay: Have you, have you ever heard of a movie called Into His Arms?
