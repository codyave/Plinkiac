And...schlock!
What?
What?
Gorilla Interrupted was a horrible mistake
1...2...3...ooh!
It was a collaboration between four people to make a science fiction comedy film in seven days with a budget of $0.
I'm poking some lights through a sheet of insulation board in the attempt of making a control panel for an alien spacecraft.
It was a disaster.
It was a nightmare.
And it was an embarrassing experience for everyone involved.
How do you feel about our entire stay at the Rich Evans house?
Sick.
I need a doctor.
This fucking huge metal chair fucking fell on my arm.
How ya doing?
Oh, god.
Oh, holy shit.
We're screwed now!
We're fucked.
