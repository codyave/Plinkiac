[0:30] [Rich walks up to Mike]
Rich: [In a tired, unenthusiastic voice] Hi, Mike [Mike is standing next to a tall, veiled object, he looks up from the piece of paper he’s holding] What’s...this?
Mike: Why, it’s the...Wheel of the Worst! [He removes the black cloth covering the Wheel]
R: Ok, so we’re gonna give this thing three spins, and whatever it lands on we’re gonna watch. Ok, why don’t we tell the audience what we’re gonna watch today?
M: Well, first up, is The Family Guide to the Internet
R: Then we have Let’s Rap Fire Safety
M: Candid Camera Volume 6
R: Gary Coleman For Safety’s Sake
M: Dancin’ Grannies Mature Fitness for beginners
R: Then there’s Tree Stand Safety
M: The Dance of Birth
R: And then finally The Shoji Tabuchi Show
M I have no idea what the fuck that is. It’s “the family show that’s the talk of the town,” though. Alright, Rich, why don’t you give it a spin?
R: Alright [Rubs palms together] Here we go! Here we go! [Lands on Candid Candid Camera] 
Jay (?): Oh no 
R: Candid Candid Camera Volume 6
M: Let’s go

[1:50] Allen Funt: The next sequence might be called “why I like to be nude” [Mike, Rich, and Jay laugh]
J: If it doesn’t feature him being nude, then I don’t care

[2:50] [Allen Funt has a teddy bear on his lap]
J: I think we--oh my god
[Jessi laughs loudly] Jessi: Why is it...
M: I think it involves children now

[3:37] J: She’s not a fireman
JS: She looks like a fly girl

[3:47] M: “My battery needs changing”
R: My pants need changing

[3:58] M: They should make a video about rap safety. Don’t rappers get killed a lot?

[4:44] [Jay spins the Wheel, it lands on The Dance of Birth]
JS: Oh no!
J: Oh! Fuck you, Dance of Birth!
JS: Can we do this over? Please! I don’t want that one!

[5:01] M: Ok, time for me to shut this off

[5:31] JS: Why don’t they slap me in the face with more feminist bullshit

[13:34] J: So basically, this--this Candid Candid Camera Volume 6 is unintentionally a window into the underbelly of--of perversion and homelessness

[14:53] M: I hope they all die

[14:55] R: I could’ve used this video, ‘cause when I was younger, I almost burned down my grandmother's house cooking french fries. Just like the kid in the video almost burned down his grandfather’s house
M: Did you throw water on it?
R: I didn’t throw water on it, uh...just, my first instinct was--the kitchen had a back door, was--my first instinct was to throw it out the back door into the snow...instead I just burned my hands and dropped burning grease all over the house

[16:29] M: Rich, what were your favorite parts of Let’s Rap About Fire Safety
R: Uhh yeah...probably the fire alarm’s eyes shaking...back and forth
M: That part was your favorite part?
R: I have no favorite part…..The crappy CGI
M: That’s the thing, though, for 2000, the CGI in this was appalling. I would expect more from AllState

[17:27] J: Well, The Dance of Birth is the greatest movie that David Lynch never made

[19:16] R: It’s--it’s an hour of incoherent New Age babble
Narrator Lady: By releasing our throats we support the softening of our pelvic floors

[20:23] R: I don’t think the video even says what benefit there is to this, it just says to do it
J: No, I wonder how many babies died in the womb because of this video
R: We had a lot of babies born with shaken baby syndrome

[20:38] Narrator: Roots….connecting deep into the belly...of earth...supporting all of our parts, head...heart, wings, and belly

[20:52] R: She’s saying nonsense, and she thinks she’s smart for saying complete and utter nonsense, I would love to sit down with a group of doctors and pediatricians and watch The Dance of the Birth and they would probably laugh harder than anyone

[21:19] R: It’s absolute nonsense packaged as wisdom
JS: It should be--it should be stated also that the husbands didn’t look very embarrassed of what they were doing, but the babies looked embarrassed

[22:12] M: So we have--we have…[Taps The Dance of Birth] Birth….[Taps Candid Candid Camera] sexual desire and [Taps Let’s Rap Fire Safety] self-preservation

[22:47] M: Your child may grow up to be an elderly man who drinks himself to death
J: Yeah, an alcoholic pervert
[The camera zooms in on Jay’s bottle]

[23:51] M: Rich
R: Candid Camera Volume 6 is a…[Giggles] it’s a cesspool of human filth

[25:40] R: Can you imagine this [Indicates the Candid Candid Camera tape] without the laugh track? Can you...It would be--it would be like watching a snuff film

[27:01] R: See, this--[Points to The Dance of Birth] this is like going to church, ok...everybody--everybody--everybody gets together, they pretend there’s a big man in the sky, and they go home feeling happy

[28:51] R: [To the burning tape] “Smile. You’re on Candid Camera”
