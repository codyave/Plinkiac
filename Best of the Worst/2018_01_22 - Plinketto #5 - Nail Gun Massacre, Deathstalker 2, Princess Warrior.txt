Jack: Hey, Mike!
Mike: [Despondent] Hi
JK: I noticed no Rich today, do you know where he went to?
M: Oh, he’s dead 
[Intro plays] 
JK: This looks like an amazing Plinketto board, I’m super excited for all of this...
M: So many films today...uh--uh--let’s go through the films on the Plinketto board today! The first film is called A Gnome Named Gnorm
JK: Oh! Ok
M: Uh, Anthony Michael Hall and a lil’ gnome from outer space
JK: Nice
M: Also known by its French version [Bends down to pick up a tape from out of frame]
JK: Oh! Yeah?
M: Space Cop….What’s next?
JK: Next on the board, back again, Twin Dragon Encounter starring twin martial arts masters
M:...That’s right, are they really twins or…?
JK: I beli--I believe--
M: Michael and Martin McNamara, huh huuuhh huh
JK: Yeah
M: And you found this at a thrift store in Bangkok, right?
JK: I, uhh, it was a, it was a second hand store in Canada
M: Okay, that’s pretty close. After that…[Stutters] a mainstay on the Plinketto board, which apparently can’t be removed, it’s Deathstalker 2
JK: We have to see the whole series
M: I haven’t seen the first one, I don’t know why 2 is here, what the fffffuck
[Plays clip from Plinketto #1 showing Mike watching Deathstalker 1]
JK: I’ll--I’m gonna do a quick recap if we land on it
M: Okay
JK: Everyone gets raped 
[Silence]
M: Sooo, it’s a film about Hollywood? [Carnival music plays, Jack almost freaks out] What’s next?
JK: [Almost laughs] Next is Metalbeast: DNA Overload, oh I’m sorry, Project Metalbeast: DNA Overload
M: DNA Overload? Isn’t that the Louis C.K. story? [Boing sound effect plays] (?)
JK: Heyooooo
M: Oh yeah, wh--what’s Metalbeast: DNA Overload about? [Jack begins to respond] Probably a monster, right?
JK: Pr--probably
M: So, a film about Harvey Weinstein [Horn blows]
JK: Heyoooo!! [Punches the air] The hits! Keep! On! Comin’!! [Turns and points to the camera] Take that...Hollywood elite! [Plays clip of a sports car driving up to a fancy house (?)] 
M: Our next film is called Nail Gun Massacre 
[Pause]
JK:...Uhh, all of these--I--the--I--I want so many people dead. With nails. In their eyeballs?
M: Yeah
JK: Or other holes in their body
M: Yeah, I mean, there hasn’t been a really good horror film about someone killing people with a nail gun 
JK: Yeah
M: And...this is it, probably
JK: Next! We got Amazons, we got sexy ladies, we got lightsabers in: Princess Warrior
M: The next film...is called Vibrations...starring...Michael J. Fox 
JK: Oh…’cause he has…[Shakes his fists]
M: No, ‘cause he’s in the film, he’s listed on the box
JK: [Bends down to look closer] I don’t--I don’t see that
M: Oh, wait, sorry, it says James Marshall
JK: Okay
M: I don’t have my glasses on. I wasn’t making a joke about a deadly disease…
JK: That would be…
M: You think I’m some kind of fucking asshole?
JK: Up next is Crypt Z [Mike laughs] Or...what is probably Cryptzzz
M: It’s probably Cryptz, with a little hip hop flare to it
JK: Cryptzzz....uh, “”Terror under...the hood!” [Car horn honks] Not the car…
M: Yeah, I was gonna say
JK: The neighbor…
M: And then yeah, neighborhood. It sounds like an automotive problem [Car honks again] Our next film...is called “Slithisis,” [Corrects himself] Slithis, and I’m particularly excited about this one, uh, the font is very 80s, it looks like Masters of the Universe, um, aaand, or like a Hasbro toy or something from the 80s and then there’s a monster on there. Kind of looks like Zaat...uh, kind of looks like Creature from the Black Lagoon…
JK: It looks like Zaat’s been juicin’
M: It looks like a jacked Zaat
JK: Yeah
M: And, um, uh uh uh, what does it say? “Hell hath no fury like Slithis!”
JK: Just so--catchy title
M: Is he a female?
JK: [Takes a second to get it] Oh [Snaps] Slithis…
M: “Hell hath no fury like a Slithis scorned.” What’s our last film?
JK:...Is...Bio Kids! Five...Super...Heroes....They’re little kid Power Rangers and it looks like they fight or befriend a clown
M: Look at it up close
JK: [Picks up the tape] Is is a secret Asian man?
M: I think it’s a film from China. Or maybe Japan
JK: Yes, it looks to be the case, um, I’m very excited about this as a big fan of Power Rangers [Puts the tape back] I’m excited to see the expanded universe
M: Well, I’m very excited to see what tape we land on, in this first Plinketto drop
JK: Go ahead, Mike!
M: Alright, here we go, everybody [Picks up the ball] I’m gonna walk around to the back of the device now
JK: Yep 
M: [Atop the ladder] Here we goooo! First film of the day….[Lets go of the ball] Go! Da-da-da-da...Oh! Oh! Woah woah woah woah! What! What the fuck! [Lands on Nail Gun Massacre] What is it?
JK: It...is...Nail...Gun...Massacre!!! [Imitates a firing nail gun] 
[Mike starts dancing, then Jack] [Mike pretends to fall from the ladder and screams, Jay and Josh laugh in the background] 
*Nail Gun Massacre*
M: Well....I nailed it [Groans] [Jack yells] “It’s cheaper than a chainsaw” the Nail Gun Massacre, a VHS tape that once belonged to Cheryl [Cheryl is written in Sharpie on the case] She marked it with her name, so nobody stole her tape
JK: They--the, uh...the dorm, the college dorm she stayed in, they had several copies of Nail Gun Massacre
M: [Chuckling] Yes
JK: But that was Cheryl’s
M: This was Cheryl’s 
JK: Yup
M: And then there’s a pun here, “very penetrating story,” so this may have some comedic edge to it, hopefully. “Forget about that guy with the chainsaw”
JK: He’s outta here
M: “And start worrying about the deranged Nail Gun Killer……..A beautiful young girl is brutally gang-raped--” [Record scratch] For fuck’s sake...uh, “by construction workers at a building site in a small Texas town.” This is like a mad lib [Jay and Jack laugh] “Suddenly mutilated bodies begin turning up. Nailed up. Nailed to trees. Nailed to pavement. Nailed to each other,” now it sounds like Dr. Seuss [Jack laughs] “The Nail Gun Maniac is deadly and no one knows who he’ll hammer down next”?
JK: Hammer down, is that kinda--
M: Shoulda been “who he’ll nail next”
JK: The--there’s a lot of nails, they gotta vary it up a little bit
M: “It’s a piercing no-holes barred trip into industrial strength horror!” Several puns going on there 
JK: All you can hope for in this kind of premise-driven slasher flick is interesting deaths
M: Yeah. Well, let’s go find out, it’s time to go watch The Nail Gun Massacre [Jack marches in place and sings] 

[9:45] [Jack and Josh stand in front of the board with their arms outstretched]
JK: We just saw a movieee. We sure did
Josh: We absolutely did 
JK: Now we’re back here to film the ball drop, go ahead
JH: Oh!
JK: Josh
JH: Oh, thank you. Thank you for the--that’s very nice of you
JK: I know it’s (?) I get it [Josh climbs the ladder]
JH: Okay! Here we go! This is how this works!
JK: You drop the ball, we choose a movieeee!
[Josh drops the ball, lands on Deathstalker 2]
M: Noooo! 
JH: What’d we get?
JK: Deathstalker 2!!!
JH: OHHH FUUUUUUUUCCCKKKK [Josh and Mike groan]
*Movie #2 Deathstalker 2*
JH: Deathstalker 2, “his battle isn’t over yet”...because there’s a 2 [Jack shakes his fists] Oh, dear
JK: Wait
JH: Yes
JK: We need to remember what happened in Deathstalker 1
JH: Rape
JK: Besides that
JH: Whimsical rape 
JK:...Okay…
JH: Puppet guy. Alright--[Reads the back]--“twice the action. Twice the passion. Twice the adventure.” And yet, it’s only 85 minutes long
JK: Perfect
JH: That seems crazy. “Monique Gabrielle, sexy star of ‘Bachelor Party,’ ‘Hot Moves,’ and ‘Flashdance’ and John Terlesky, star of ‘Secret Admirer’ and ‘The Allnighter,’” and Chopping Mall. Tinyface from Chopping Mall, he is the Deathstalker, “join forces to swashbuckle their way to save civilization in this outrageous sequel to Deathstalker! [Imitates fanfare] Enter Deathstalker”
JK: Yeah!!
JH: “Capturing the real Princess Evie,” not the evil one, “he must now return her to her rightful place of power. But the fabled swordsman’s battle has just begun. Standing in his way are cutthroat pirates, bloodthirsty Amazons, flesh-eating zombies...and then things start to get dangerous!”
Both: [Mockingly] Woah-oah-oah!
JH: [Chuckles] “Finally, they confront the sinister power mongers in a spectacular duel to the death!”
JK: So, wait...this movie involves another swordsman’s battle? (?)
JH: Yeah….I--I can’t say I’m shocked by that 
JK: Get--get a new premise, Deathstalker 2
JH: Listen, here’s the thing, when the warlords fall…
JK: Oh yeah?
JH: Deathstalker will be king!....So we don’t have to watch the movie, we can just--we--we’re done, alright, um...even after all that I guess we have to watch it, so let’s go do that [Walks away]
JK: Great! [Walks backwards] [Singing] Walking to watch the movieee!

[12:10] [ Rich runs into the screening room while in the middle of the guys watching Deathstalker 2]
Rich: Guys, guys! I’m not dead, it was just insurance fraud! 
JH: Uh--fine, yeah, yeah, we’re watching Deathstalker 2, just sit sit sit--
R: Oh, shit!
JH: Sit, go go go [Rich sits down] Look at that
R: Did they rape yet? 

[13:31] Deathstalker: Very interesting. Is there another way in?
Princess: Tsk, of course 
JH: That was the weirdest hee haw joke I’ve ever seen

[13:51] [At the board]
J: Well, Jack, it’s occurred to me that you have never dropped the ball...on the Plinketto board, and sooo--[Begins to walk behind the board, turns back around]--here you go, drop the ball [Gives Jack the ball, Jack looks at the ball, speechless] 
JK: Yeah, like, this is gonna…?
J: This isn’t a bait and switch, we already did that, kind of
JK: [Slowly makes his way behind the board] Drop the ball and this is gonna happen?
J: Yes! You’re gonna drop the ball and we’re gonna watch whatever movie it lands on. No--no jokes [Jack slowly disappears behind the board] 
JK: [Atop the ladder] Okay, um...so I can just put it anywhere 
J: Just drop the ball, that’s how this works [Jack drops the ball] Princess Warrior?!
M: What!
J: [Harshly] God damn it, Jack! That’s like the worst one on the board!
JH: You fucking serious?
M: You were supposed to land on something else!
J: Jesus Christ! Don’t you know how this works?
JK: [Shrinking away] I just dropped the ball!
J: Fuckin’ shit, man!
JH: Fuckin’--Jack! Goddamnit!
*Movie #3 Princess Warrior*
J: [Sighing] Alright, Jack...why don’t you read the box for...Princess Warrior? 
JK: I ju--I just dropped the ball, like, everyone, everyone drops the ball
J: I--I--yeah, I know you dropped the ball 
JK:...Princess Warrior, “they fought for a Kingdom”
J: Is there more than one Princess Warrior?
JK: “The--they fought for a Kingdom. On a planet far away, the great kingdom is ruled by a Warrior Queen who lies dying” 
[Long pause]
J: [Laughs] Wait, what? Oh, like she lies...she’s lying down dying
JK: Yes
J: She’s not a Queen that is lying...
JK: While dying 
J: While dying
JK: Yeah
J: Okay!
JK: “The Earth is flat!” [Jay laughs] Uh, so the Queen who’s dying…
J: Yeah
JK: In different states of standing and lying down
J: Yes
JK: “Her last act as Queen is to pass the Ring of Power to the oldest daughter.” Not necessarily her oldest daughter, just the oldest daughter
J: Just who’s the oldest daughter on her planet
JK: Right, it’s a whole lottery system
M: It’s some really old lady somewhere 
JK: [In an old lady voice] “I’m someone’s daughter…” [Jay laughs] That’s why the Queens keep dying while laying down, they’re all elderly ladies
J: Sure
JK: “But the Ring is passed to the gentle, loving, younger daughter....Ovule.” I’m trying to figure out how to pronounce this, O-V-U-L-E
J: That’s a pretty on-the-nose, uh, name for a Princess Warrior character
JK: And her sister Labias [Jay laughs] “As the Queen dies, war erupts between the two sisters,”  so, obviously...good sister, bad sister
J: Yes
JK: Umm, “and rages throughout the kingdom. The good sister flees to safety to the planet Earth where she is pursued by a trio of evil cohorts”
J: So this is gonna be the typical 80s sci-fi plot where they’re in--in a far-away fantasy world for five minutes, and then they’re just on Earth ‘cause it’s cheaper
JK: They’re just in the California dessert for the rest of the movie, maaaybe they go back at the very end
J: Possibly
JK: “Before Ovule can gain the throne, she must battle her sister...to the death!”
J: Alright!
JK: The Princess Warrior! I’m super excited to watch this ‘cause it was my pick! Let’s go! [Jogs away A-ha style] (?)
J: All these good choices [Shakes his head] …...I wish Rich Evans wasn’t dead

[18:09] [Hard cut to topless women in a glass tube, Mike spits out his drink, Jay laughs]
JH: What!
R: Why do they have to be naked to travel in these…?
JK: Who cares, man!
JH: Oh my god
M: I’ll spit on everything….just a hard cut to that. They have to be nudie, Rich...in the travel tube. And they’re gonna appear at the wet t-shirt...con--oh my god

[18:56] [At the table] 
J: When we started the discussion, Rich Evans was still alive
JK: Oh, it’s true, but then he--
J: But then he exploded, yeah

[20:01] J: There’s not even, like, a company logo…
JH: No!
J: There’s not even, uh, trailers. You just put the tape in and it just fades up on gang rape
M: Jay, it started before we put the tape in. I don’t know how, but it did
J: The gang rape has just always been here

[31:35] [Woman starts crying because she’s been left alone]
Woman: (?) you said you’d be back
J: And you’re not yet
JK: It’s not quite right….
M: “Ricky….you said I could go to the show”
JK: “Oh, but Lucy, you’re the boss”
[Girls hears something and stops crying]
JH: Alright, fuck it
M: When is this ending?

[32:45] JK: All you can expect from a premise-heavy horror movie like this is interesting kills with the nail gun, you know, much like, much like, uh...Killer Workout
J: Ohh, yeah
JK: You just want kills with workout equipment, here you just want fun kills with the nail gun. We don’t even get that, it’s just nails--
J: Well, I think it’s, there’s not much you can do!
M: You know what, you know what, you need a team of, like, like, 25 writers--
J: You need a writer’s room
M:--going, “okay, what kinda--like--uh--we--we’ve come up with four, on our dry erase board. E--everybody think, okay, bring in 58 more writers” [Jay laughs] There’s like--there’s like--there’s like 108 people in a room and they’re all just like--[Puts hand on temple] 
JH: “Well, what if, uh…”
M: “What if, uh, no no no”
JH: “No, that would be silly” 
JK: “All of these are impractical”
JH: “How about…?”
J: “Wait wait wait, guys, I have a great idea...let’s not make this movie”
JK: That’s out of the question, it’s ha--it’s mid-production
M: Jay, that’s the best idea they could’ve had

[35:08] [Making fun of the terrible main actress]
J: She may be the best actress...did she win an Academy Award? For Deathstalker--
JH: Eat shit, Meryl Streep…Deathstalker 2 is where it’s at

[38:45] M: One of the funnier moments during our screening was we...uh, someone said “this feels like a Mel Brooks film” because, like, “these are my hitmen,” and there’s like guy, guy….
JH: The guy with the eyepatch?
M: Yeah
J: We get a flat dolly shot
M: Flat dolly…
J: One person, next character…
M: Trucking shot, left to right…
J: Oh, yeah yeah yeah
M: Um, from this guy to this guy to this guy and then the last one is the comedy punch, and you--[Points to Josh]--called it
[Plays clip, in the screening room]
