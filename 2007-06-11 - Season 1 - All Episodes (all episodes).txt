[Season 3]
Hi, honey. I'm home!
Hi, dear. Here's your pizza!
That's all you made for me, is the fucking goddamn pizza?
No! No, Cliff, no! Oh, god!
Grabowski's residence.
Right, enough with the small talk. Look, honey, Sammy's head is caught in the storm drain.
Oh, my gosh. Call the fire department.
Listen very carefully, stupid. His head is caught in the storm drain. He's not on fire, you moron.
All right, where are you at? I'll be right there.
Top of the morning to you, officer!
Cliff!
Yeah?
Cliff, where's the baby?
The what?
The baby!
He's right there, he's in the storm drain.
Oh, god. We've gotta call somebody. We've gotta do something before it...rains.
Honey, we can't call anybody. Remember what the state said. One more child-related "incident", and they're gonna take away our welfare checks. Which means--
That means I won't get my cigarettes or my pain pills for free anymore.
It also means I'm gonna have to go back to work. Who's gonna sit on their ass all day and watch The Munsters? I provide a valuable service to the television industry.
You know what, for the first time in my life, I think I agree with you.
Hmm.
What are we gonna do?
We strip all his clothes off. We leave him here. No one has to know he was our baby. They'll think it was a stray that got his head caught here.
What about the DNA?
We scrape it off.
That won't work.
Why not?
DNA's in the liver...right?
I dunno.
I don't remember. You know what, I'll look on the web, I'll check my Blackberry.
I'll bluetooth it. 411, hello?
How do you work this again?
Hello? Where is the DNA?
I'm not getting anything.
Where's the DNA in a baby?
Oh. Okay.
What do you got?
Web MD...
Yeah.
...says that DNA is everywhere.
What would Herman Munster do?
Die of pancreatic cancer?
No, no. He would cut Sammy's head off. He would take it down to the basement laboratory, and Grandpa Munster would reattach it.
Cliff, that's crazy. We don't have a laboratory or a Grandpa Munster.
Wait. I know what we should do. We cut Sammy's head off. We take it down to a basement laboratory, where Grandpa Munster...oh. He freed himself.
We are such good parents.
Really? I've never tried hot wax before. It sounds erotic.
It really is. And you know what, you should get to know the candlestick maker, cuz he is so good. Oh, great. Cliff's home.
Here, start making dinner. We're having a guest tonight.
Really? Who?
Frank Hammer. He was on the east side. He's never over there. I had to invite him here. I had to settle the score.
Who's Frank Hammer?
Only Cliff's arch-nemesis, and the only man to survive getting punched in the face by Cliff and not getting knocked out immediately.
So, Cliff. 
Yeah.
How's that wife of yours, what's-her-name?
Honey.
Honey. I bet her pussy is a sweet ass, eh Cliff?
I'm sorry. What did you say?
I'm saying that I'd like a slice of that sweet honey pie. Metaphorically speaking, of course.
Mm-hmm.
You know, Cliff, if you were to ever die, or even to be slightly injured, I'd be over there fucking that little princess faster than you could say. I'm saying that if she's the honey, I could be the king bee. And that little honey would get some of my king bee honey. You know, some of my metaphorical honey all over her face and boobs. All hail the king bee! A-buzz, a-buzz!
How many times have I told you, there's no such thing as a fuckingking bee.
I'm sorry. Did you say something?
It was more than just not getting knocked out. The man didn't even flinch. Now I've punched out men, statues, horses, women, even dinosaurs. But not Frank Hammer. He's like the Lois Lane to my Superman.
Don't you mean kryptonite to your Superman?
No, no, I don't mean that at all.
Cliff. You said there'd be dinner. Well, looks like I'll be eating out.
Yep, still got it. That was all me. All me, still got it, yep.
Fuck you.
Hello, honey.
I'd like you to start taking one of these pills every morning.
Cliff, I already take a multi-vitamin.
No, it's not a multi-vitamin. It's a morning after pill. Just wanna be certain.
But Cliff, we barely have sex. And when we do, I usually wake up right in the middle of it and shove you off of me, so I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Honey, it's not for me. IT's for the others. I've been talking to some of those guy that wait at the AIDS clinic, and they've told me where you've been at night. You've been going to those speed-dating things. And I know you, honey. You have sex before the first date. So, what am I to do?
Yeah, but won't those make me sick?
Yeah. No. Absolutely yes, no, no. Probably not.
All right, honestly, I think I should talk to my doctor first.
Well, that is perfect, because I am your doctor now.
What?
Yep, got my degree six minutes ago online. Yep. Nurse!
Here's the form. I need you to sign here, here, here, and here.
Okay. Well, you know what, maybe this is a good thing that you're a doctor now, Cliff, because you really should be looking at Sammy. He has this huge tumor on his head.
Yeah, let me take a look.
Sammy, no!
He'll be fine. Now, back to you. Nurse, 10 cc's of sodium pentathol.
Yes, Dr. Grabowski.
