I actually just look at the pictures see
why are criminals constantly hitting
Batman with their guns instead of just
shooting him oh how did they know the
existence an exact location of Batman's
top secret armory when Lucius said it
was completely off the book are you
having a good Christmas because I am
what's Christmas eggnog
why are all the criminals constantly
hitting Batman with their why
don't they just shoot him how did they
know about the existence and the exact
location of Batman's secret armory
especially when Lucius Jackson said it
was off the books look it's it's a thing
that you put under your small toddler to
prop them up so that they could eat fast
food at your dinner table why would the
CIA let masked men onto their plane
without checking who they were first did
they use the honor system
the CIA stand for come on board my plane
didn't he need a doctor doctor I
pronounced that word what
the voice is back I think it's the voice
of red buttons this ever gonna
shut up every time I try and ask a
question he butts in with another
question shoot him shoot the voice over
I'm out of ballots how is it possible
that Bruce Wayne completely healed us
broke it back in less than three months
without the aid of any medical
technology I guess it healed on its own
cuz that's what the human body does or
why didn't you just detonate the bomb
right then what bomb the bomb in her
pants that's a vagina her fold me
it blew my penis off what's happening J
who's what who it where's this
disembodied voice coming from the last
time I heard a disembodied voice that
told me to murder you
Oh God why didn't you just do what it
said how is it possible that Bruce Wayne
was able to climb out of the hole when
no one else had ever done it before is
it because he's the hero of the film if
Talia knew he was Batman why did she
just let him wander off with Lucius why
didn't she just kill him right then and
there and end the movie 30 minutes into
the film with an unsatisfactory plot I
was Bruce Wayne able to climb out of the
hole in the prison is it because it was
the point of the entire movie was that
you the who farted that wasn't a fart
there was a movie trailer voiceover oh
it sounds like so many of my farts why
didn't you just blow up the bomb right
then why all the theatrics what is this
a movie
Batman doesn't fly you're mistaken that
with spider-man I didn't say anything
you're talking to me telepathically or
was that Fred Savage he just had a baby
you know Fred Savage - yeah mmm it was a
tasty did Bruce Wayne do anything at all
those eight years in between the two
movies what did he just mope around all
day I did Batman get back to Gotham
after escaping that weird prison public
transportation like the bus yeah in his
weird little prison drove why not have
you ever bound the bus and a whole bunch
of weirdos on the bus after
escaping from the prison hole how did
Batman get back to Gotham City they
never explained that clearly in the
movie and I'm an idiot
I don't even remember the Dark Knight
Rises I just saw it
I can't do it oh yeah again
